my worn nerves broke down , and I sat shivering and twitching , the pitiable wreck of a man.It was the sound of Agatha 's voice and the rustle of her dress which restored me . I looked up , and saw her blue eyes , so full of tenderness and pity , gazing down at me . `` We must take you away to the country , Austin , '' she said . `` You want rest and quiet . You look wretchedly ill. '' '' Oh , it is nothing ! '' said I , trying to smile . `` It was only a momentary weakness . I am all right again now . `` `` I am so sorry to keep you waiting . Poor boy , you must have been here quite half an hour ! The vicar was in the drawing-room , and , as I knew that you did not care for him , I thought it better that Jane should show you up here . I thought the man would never go ! `` `` Thank God he stayed ! Thank God he stayed ! '' I cried hysterically . `` Why , what is the matter with you , Austin ? '' she asked , holding my arm as I staggered up from the chair . `` Why are you glad that the vicar stayed ? And what is this little bottle in your hand ? `` `` Nothing , '' I cried , thrusting it into my pocket . `` But I must go . I have something important to do . `` `` How stern you look , Austin ! I have never seen your face like that . You are angry ? `` `` Yes , I am angry . `` `` But not with me ? `` `` No , no , my darling ! You would not understand . `` `` But you have not told me why you came . `` `` I came to ask you whether you would always love me -- -no matter what I did , or what shadow might fall on my name . Would you believe in me and trust me however black appearances might be against me ? `` `` You know that I would , Austin . `` `` Yes , I know that you would . What I do I shall do for you . I am driven to it . There is no other way out , my darling ! '' I kissed her and rushed from the room.The time for indecision was at an end . As long as the creature threatened my own prospects and my honor there might be a question as to what I should do . But now , when Agatha -- -my innocent Agatha -- -was endangered , my duty lay before me like a turnpike road . I had no weapon , but I never paused for that . What weapon should I need , when I felt every muscle quivering with the strength of a frenzied man ? I ran through the streets , so set upon what I had to do that I was only dimly conscious of the faces of friends whom I met -- -dimly conscious also that Professor Wilson met me , running with equal precipitance in the opposite direction . Breathless but resolute I reached the house and rang the bell . A white cheeked maid opened the door , and turned whiter yet when she saw the face that looked in at her . `` Show me up at once to Miss Penclosa , '' I demanded . `` Sir , '' she gasped , `` Miss Penclosa died this afternoon at half-past three !
