led to his home.Robert McIntyre had converted a large bare room in the upper storey of Elmdene into a studio , and thither he retreated after lunch . It was as well that he should have some little den of his own , for his father would talk of little save of his ledgers and accounts , while Laura had become peevish and querulous since the one tie which held her to Tamfield had been removed . The chamber was a bare and bleak one , un-papered and un-carpeted , but a good fire sparkled in the grate , and two large windows gave him the needful light . His easel stood in the centre , with the great canvas balanced across it , while against the walls there leaned his two last attempts , `` The Murder of Thomas of Canterbury '' and `` The Signing of Magna Charta . '' Robert had a weakness for large subjects and broad effects . If his ambition was greater than his skill , he had still all the love of his art and the patience under discouragement which are the stuff out of which successful painters are made . Twice his brace of pictures had journeyed to town , and twice they had come back to him , until the finely gilded frames which had made such a call upon his purse began to show signs of these varied adventures . Yet , in spite of their depressing company , Robert turned to his fresh work with all the enthusiasm which a conviction of ultimate success can inspire.But he could not work that afternoon.In vain he dashed in his background and outlined the long curves of the Roman galleys . Do what he would , his mind would still wander from his work to dwell upon his conversation with the vicar in the morning . His imagination was fascinated by the idea of this strange man living alone amid a crowd , and yet wielding such a power that with one dash of his pen he could change sorrow into joy , and transform the condition of a whole parish . The incident of the fifty-pound note came back to his mind . It must surely have been Raffles Haw with whom Hector Spurling had come in contact . There could not be two men in one parish to whom so large a sum was of so small an account as to be thrown to a bystander in return for a trifling piece of assistance . Of course , it must have been Raffles Haw . And his sister had the note , with instructions to return it to the owner , could he be found . He threw aside his palette , and descending into the sitting-room he told Laura and his father of his morning 's interview with the vicar , and of his conviction that this was the man of whom Hector was in quest. '' Tut ! Tut ! '' said old McIntyre . `` How is this , Laura ? I knew nothing of this . What do women know of money or of business ? Hand the note over to me and I shall relieve you of all responsibility . I will take everything upon myself . `` `` I can not possibly , papa , '' said Laura , with decision . `` I should not think of parting with it . `` `` What is the world coming to ? '' cried the old man , with his thin hands held up in protest . `` You grow more undutiful every day , Laura . This money would be of use to me -- -of use , you understand . It may be the corner-stone of the vast business which I shall re-construct . I will use it , Laura , and I will pay something -- -four , shall we say , or even four and a-half -- -and you may have it back on any day . And I will give security -- -the security of my -- -well , of my word of honour . `` `` It is quite impossible , papa , '' his daughter answered coldly . `` It is not my money . Hector asked me to be his banker . Those were his very words . It is not in my power to lend it . As to what you say , Robert , you may be right or you may be wrong , but I certainly shall not give Mr. Raffles Haw or anyone else the money without Hector 's express command . `` `` You are very right about not giving it to Mr. Raffles Haw , '' cried old McIntyre , with many nods of approbation . `` I should certainly not let it go out of the family . `` `` Well , I thought that I would tell you . `` Robert picked up his Tam-o'-Shanter and strolled out to avoid the discussion between his father and sister , which he saw was about to be renewed . His artistic nature revolted at these petty and sordid disputes , and he turned to the crisp air and the broad landscape to soothe his ruffled feelings . Avarice had no place among his failings , and his father 's perpetual chatter about money inspired him with a positive loathing and disgust for the subject.Robert was lounging slowly along his favourite walk which curled over the hill , with his mind turning from the Roman invasion to the mysterious millionaire , when his eyes fell upon a tall , lean man in front of him , who , with a pipe between his lips , was endeavouring to light a match under cover of his cap . The man was clad in a rough pea-jacket , and bore traces of smoke and grime upon his face and hands . Yet there is a Freemasonry among smokers which overrides every social difference , so Robert stopped and held out his case of fusees . `` A light ? '' said he . `` Thank you . '' The man picked out a fusee , struck it , and bent his head to it . He had a pale , thin face , a short straggling beard , and a very sharp and curving nose , with decision and character in the straight thick eyebrows which almost met on either side of it . Clearly a superior kind of workman , and possibly one of those who had been employed in the construction of the new house . Here was a chance of getting some first-hand information on the question which had aroused his curiosity . Robert waited until he had lit his pipe , and then walked on beside him . `` Are you going in the direction of the new Hall ? '' he asked. '' Yes . `` The man 's voice was cold , and his manner reserved . `` Perhaps you were engaged in the building of it ? `` `` Yes , I had a hand in it . `` `` They say that it is a wonderful place inside . It has been quite the talk of the district . Is it as rich as they say ? `` `` I am sure I do n't know . I have not heard what they say . `` His attitude was certainly not encouraging , and it seemed to Robert that he gave little sidelong suspicious glances at him out of his keen grey eyes . Yet , if he were so careful and discreet there was the more reason to think that there was information to be extracted , if he could but find a way to it . `` Ah , there it lies ! '' he remarked , as they topped the brow of the hill , and looked down once more at the great building . `` Well , no doubt it is very gorgeous and splendid , but really for my own part I would rather live in my own little box down yonder in the village . `` The workman puffed gravely at his pipe . `` You are no great admirer of wealth , then ? '' he said . `` Not I. I should not care to be a penny richer than I am . Of course I should like to sell my pictures . One must make a living . But beyond that I ask nothing . I dare say that I , a poor artist , or you , a man who work for your bread , have more happiness out of life than the owner of that great palace . `` `` Indeed , I think that it is more than likely , '' the other answered , in a much more conciliatory voice . `` Art , '' said Robert , warming to the subject , `` is her own reward . What mere bodily indulgence is there which money could buy which can give that deep thrill of satisfaction which comes on the man who has conceived something new , something beautiful , and the daily delight as he sees it grow under his hand , until it stands before him a completed whole ? With my art and without wealth I am happy . Without my art I should have a void which no money could fill . But I really do n't know why I should say all this to you . `` The workman had stopped , and was staring at him earnestly with a look of the deepest interest upon his smoke-darkened features . `` I am very glad to hear what you say , '' said he . `` It is a pleasure to know that the worship of gold is not quite universal , and that there are at least some who can rise above it . Would you mind my shaking you by the hand ? `` It was a somewhat extraordinary request , but Robert rather prided himself upon his Bohemianism , and upon his happy facility for making friends with all sorts and conditions of men . He readily exchanged a cordial grip with his chance acquaintance . `` You expressed some curiosity as to this house . I know the grounds pretty well , and might perhaps show you one or two little things which would interest you . Here are the gates . Will you come in with me ? `` Here was , indeed , a chance . Robert eagerly assented , and walked up the winding drive amid the growing fir-trees . When he found his uncouth guide , however , marching straight across the broad , gravel square to the main entrance , he felt that he had placed himself in a false position . `` Surely not through the front door , '' he whispered , plucking his companion by the sleeve . `` Perhaps Mr. Raffles Haw might not like it . `` `` I do n't think there will be any difficulty , '' said the other , with a quiet smile . `` My name is Raffles Haw . `` Robert McIntyre 's face must have expressed the utter astonishment which filled his mind at this most unlooked-for announcement . For a moment he thought that his companion must be joking , but the ease and assurance with which he lounged up the steps , and the deep respect with which a richly-clad functionary in the hall swung open the door to admit him , showed that he spoke in sober earnest . Raffles Haw glanced back , and seeing the look of absolute amazement upon the young artist 's features , he chuckled quietly to himself . `` You will forgive me , wo n't you
