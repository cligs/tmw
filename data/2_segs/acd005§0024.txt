allude . `` `` Then there is the more credit to your Majesty for having resisted them.You have done nobly , sire . You have earned the praise and blessing ofHoly Church . `` `` I trust that what I have done is right , father , '' said the king gravely . `` I should be glad to see you again later in the evening , but at presentI desire a little leisure for solitary thought . `` Father la Chaise left the cabinet with a deep distrust of the king 's intentions . It was obvious that the powerful appeals which had been made to him had shaken if they had failed to alter his resolution . What would be the result if more were made ? And more would be made ; that was as certain as that darkness follows light . Some master-card must be played now which would bring the matter to a crisis at once , for every day of delay was in favour of their opponents . To hesitate was to lose . All must be staked upon one final throw.The Bishop of Meaux was waiting in the ante-room , and Father la Chaise in a few brief words let him see the danger of the situation and the means by which they should meet it . Together they sought Madame de Maintenon in her room . She had discarded the sombre widow 's dress which she had chosen since her first coming to court , and wore now , as more in keeping with her lofty prospects , a rich yet simple costume of white satin with bows of silver serge . A single diamond sparkled in the thick coils of her dark tresses . The change had taken years from a face and figure which had always looked much younger than her age , and as the two plotters looked upon her perfect complexion , her regular features , so calm and yet so full of refinement , and the exquisite grace of her figure and bearing , they could not but feel that if they failed in their ends , it was not for want of having a perfect tool at their command.She had risen at their entrance , and her expression showed that she had read upon their faces something of the anxiety which filled their minds . `` You have evil news ! '' she cried . `` No , no , my daughter . '' It was the bishop who spoke . `` But we must be on our guard against our enemies , who would turn the king away from you if they could . `` Her face shone at the mention of her lover . `` Ah , you do not know ! '' she cried . `` He has made a vow . I would trust him as I would trust myself . I know that he will be true . `` But the Jesuit 's intellect was arrayed against the intuition of the woman . `` Our opponents are many and strong , '' said he shaking his head . `` Even if the king remain firm , he will be annoyed at every turn , so that he will feel his life is darker instead of lighter , save , of course , madame , for that brightness which you can not fail to bring with you . We must bring the matter to an end . `` `` And how , father ? `` `` The marriage must be at once ! `` `` At once ! '' '' Yes . This very night , if possible . `` `` Oh , father , you ask too much . The king would never consent to such a proposal . `` `` It is he that will propose it . `` `` And why ? `` `` Because we shall force him to . It is only thus that all the opposition can be stopped . When it is done , the court will accept it . Until it is done , they will resist it . `` `` What would you have me do , then , father ? `` `` Resign the king . `` `` Resign him ! '' She turned as pale as a lily , and looked at him in bewilderment . `` It is the best course , madame . `` `` Ah , father , I might have done it last month , last week , even yesterday morning . But now -- -oh , it would break my heart ! `` `` Fear not , madame . We advise you for the best . Go to the king now , at once . Say to him that you have heard that he has been subjected to much annoyance upon your account , that you can not bear to think that you should be a cause of dissension in his own family , and therefore you will release him from his promise , and will withdraw yourself from the court forever . `` `` Go now ? At once ? `` `` Yes , without loss of an instant . `` She cast a light mantle about her shoulders . `` I follow your advice , '' she said . `` I believe that you are wiser than I.But , oh , if he should take me at my word ! `` `` He will not take you at your word . `` `` It is a terrible risk . `` `` But such an end as this can not be gained without risks . Go , my child , and may heaven 's blessing go with you ! `` The king had remained alone in his cabinet , wrapped in somewhat gloomy thoughts , and pondering over the means by which he might carry out his purpose and yet smooth away the opposition which seemed to be so strenuous and so universal . Suddenly there came a gentle tap at the door , and there was the woman who was in his thoughts , standing in the twilight before him . He sprang to his feet and held out his hands with a smile which would have reassured her had she doubted his constancy. '' Francoise ! You here ! Then I have at last a welcome visitor , and it is the first one to-day . `` `` Sire , I fear that you have been troubled . `` `` I have indeed , Francoise . `` `` But I have a remedy for it . `` `` And what is that ? `` `` I shall leave the court , sire , and you shall think no more of what has passed between us . I have brought discord where I meant to bring peace . Let me retire to St. Cyr , or to the Abbey of Fontevrault , and you will no longer be called upon to make such sacrifices for my sake . `` The king turned deathly pale , and clutched at her shawl with a trembling hand , as though he feared that she was about to put her resolution into effect that very instant . For years his mind had accustomed itself to lean upon hers . He had turned to her whenever he needed support , and even when , as in the last week , he had broken away from her for a time , it was still all-important to him to know that she was there , the faithful friend , ever forgiving , ever soothing , waiting for him with her ready counsel and sympathy . But that she should leave him now , leave him altogether , such a thought had never occurred to him , and it struck him with a chill of surprised alarm . `` You can not mean it , Francoise , '' he cried , in a trembling voice . `` No , no , it is impossible that you are in earnest . `` `` It would break my heart to leave you , sire , but it breaks it also to think that for my sake you are estranged from your own family and ministers. '' '' Tut ! Am I not the king ? Shall I not take my own course without heed to them ? No , no , Francoise , you must not leave me ! You must stay with me and be my wife . '' He could hardly speak for agitation , and he still grasped at her dress to detain her . She had been precious to him before , but was far more so now that there seemed to be a possibility of his losing her . She felt the strength of her position , and used it to the utmost . `` Some time must elapse before our wedding , sire . Yet during all that interval you will be exposed to these annoyances . How can I be happy when I feel that I have brought upon you so long a period of discomfort ? `` `` And why should it be so long , Francoise ? `` `` A day would be too long , sire , for you to be unhappy through my fault . It is a misery to me to think of it . Believe me , it would be better that I should leave you. '' '' Never ! You shall not ! Why should we even wait a day , Francoise ? I am ready . You are ready . Why should we not be married now ? `` `` At once ! Oh , sire ! `` `` We shall . It is my wish . It is my order . That is my answer to those who would drive me . They shall know nothing of it until it is done , and then let us see which of them will dare to treat my wife with anything but respect . Let it be done secretly , Francoise . I will send in a trusty messenger this very night for the Archbishop of Paris , and I swear that , if all France stand in the way , he shall make us man and wife before he departs . `` `` Is it your will , sire ? `` `` It is ; and ah , I can see by your eyes that it is yours also ! We shall not lose a moment , Francoise . What a blessed thought of mine , which will silence their tongues forever ! When it is ready they may know , but not before . To your room , then , dearest of friends and truest of women ! When we meet again , it will be to form a bond which all this court and all this kingdom shall not be able to loose . `` The king was all on fire with the excitement of this new resolution . He had lost his air of doubt and discontent , and he paced swiftly about the room with a smiling face and shining eyes . Then he touched a small gold bell , which summoned Bontems , his private body-servant . `` What o'clock is it , Bontems ? `` `` It is nearly six , sire. '' '' Hum ! '' The king considered for some moments . `` Do you know where Captain de Catinat is , Bontems ? `` `` He was in the grounds , sire , but I heard that he would ride back toParis to-night . `` `` Does he ride alone ? `` `` He has one friend with him . `` `` Who is this friend ? An officer of the guards ? `` `` No , sire ; it
