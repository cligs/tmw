the grass and ever-greens sparkling with beads of moisture ; yet the camp was loud with laughter and merriment , for a messenger had ridden in from the prince with words of heart-stirring praise for what they had done , and with orders that they should still abide in the forefront of the army.Round one of the fires were clustered four or five of the leading men of the archers , cleaning the rust from their weapons , and glancing impatiently from time to time at a great pot which smoked over the blaze . There was Aylward squatting cross-legged in his shirt , while he scrubbed away at his chain-mail brigandine , whistling loudly the while . On one side of him sat old Johnston , who was busy in trimming the feathers of some arrows to his liking ; and on the other Hordle John , who lay with his great limbs all asprawl , and his headpiece balanced upon his uplifted foot . Black Simon of Norwich crouched amid the rocks , crooning an Eastland ballad to himself , while he whetted his sword upon a flat stone which lay across his knees ; while beside him sat Alleyne Edricson , and Norbury , the silent squire of Sir Oliver , holding out their chilled hands towards the crackling faggots . `` Cast on another culpon , John , and stir the broth with thy sword-sheath , '' growled Johnston , looking anxiously for the twentieth time at the reeking pot . `` By my hilt ! '' cried Aylward , `` now that John hath come by this great ransom , he will scarce abide the fare of poor archer lads . How say you , camarade ? When you see Hordle once more , there will be no penny ale and fat bacon , but Gascon wines and baked meats every day of the seven . `` `` I know not about that , '' said John , kicking his helmet up into the air and catching it in his hand . `` I do but know that whether the broth be ready or no , I am about to dip this into it . `` `` It simmers and it boils , '' cried Johnston , pushing his hard-lined face through the smoke . In an instant the pot had been plucked from the blaze , and its contents had been scooped up in half a dozen steel head-pieces , which were balanced betwixt their owners ' knees , while , with spoon and gobbet of bread , they devoured their morning meal . `` It is ill weather for bows , '' remarked John at last , when , with a long sigh , he drained the last drop from his helmet . `` My strings are as limp as a cow 's tail this morning . `` `` You should rub them with water glue , '' quoth Johnston . `` You remember , Samkin , that it was wetter than this on the morning of Crecy , and yet I can not call to mind that there was aught amiss with our strings . `` `` It is in my thoughts , '' said Black Simon , still pensively grinding his sword , `` that we may have need of your strings ere sundown . I dreamed of the red cow last night . `` `` And what is this red cow , Simon ? '' asked Alleyne . `` I know not , young sir ; but I can only say that on the eve of Cadsand , and on the eve of Crecy , and on the eve of Nogent , I dreamed of a red cow ; and now the dream has come upon me again , so I am now setting a very keen edge to my blade . `` `` Well said , old war-dog ! '' cried Aylward . `` By my hilt ! I pray that your dream may come true , for the prince hath not set us out here to drink broth or to gather whortle-berries . One more fight , and I am ready to hang up my bow , marry a wife , and take to the fire corner . But how now , Robin ? Whom is it that you seek ? `` `` The Lord Loring craves your attendance in his tent , '' said a young archer to Alleyne.The squire rose and proceeded to the pavilion , where he found the knight seated upon a cushion , with his legs crossed in front of him and a broad ribbon of parchment laid across his knees , over which he was poring with frowning brows and pursed lips . `` It came this morning by the prince 's messenger , '' said he , `` and was brought from England by Sir John Fallislee , who is new come from Sussex . What make you of this upon the outer side ? `` `` It is fairly and clearly written , '' Alleyne answered , `` and it signifies To Sir Nigel Loring , Knight Constable of Twynham Castle , by the hand of Christopher , the servant of God at the Priory of Christchurch . `` `` So I read it , '' said Sir Nigel . `` Now I pray you to read what is set forth within . `` Alleyne turned to the letter , and , as his eyes rested upon it , his face turned pale and a cry of surprise and grief burst from his lips . `` What then ? '' asked the knight , peering up at him anxiously . `` There is nought amiss with the Lady Mary or with the Lady Maude ? `` `` It is my brother -- -my poor unhappy brother ! '' cried Alleyne , with his hand to his brow . `` He is dead . `` `` By Saint Paul ! I have never heard that he had shown so much love for you that you should mourn him so . `` `` Yet he was my brother -- -the only kith or kin that I had upon earth . Mayhap he had cause to be bitter against me , for his land was given to the abbey for my upbringing . Alas ! alas ! and I raised my staff against him when last we met ! He has been slain -- -and slain , I fear , amidst crime and violence. '' '' Ha ! '' said Sir Nigel . `` Read on , I pray you . `` `` 'God be with thee , my honored lord , and have thee in his holy keeping . The Lady Loring hath asked me to set down in writing what hath befallen at Twynham , and all that concerns the death of thy ill neighbor the Socman of Minstead . For when ye had left us , this evil man gathered around him all outlaws , villeins , and masterless men , until they were come to such a force that they slew and scattered the king 's men who went against them . Then , coming forth from the woods , they laid siege to thy castle , and for two days they girt us in and shot hard against us , with such numbers as were a marvel to see . Yet the Lady Loring held the place stoutly , and on the second day the Socman was slain -- -by his own men , as some think -- -so that we were delivered from their hands ; for which praise be to all the saints , and more especially to the holy Anselm , upon whose feast it came to pass . The Lady Loring , and the Lady Maude , thy fair daughter , are in good health ; and so also am I , save for an imposthume of the toe-joint , which hath been sent me for my sins . May all the saints preserve thee ! ' '' '' It was the vision of the Lady Tiphaine , '' said Sir Nigel , after a pause . `` Marked you not how she said that the leader was one with a yellow beard , and how he fell before the gate . But how came it , Alleyne , that this woman , to whom all things are as crystal , and who hath not said one word which has not come to pass , was yet so led astray as to say that your thoughts turned to Twynham Castle even more than my own ? `` `` My fair lord , '' said Alleyne , with a flush on his weather-stained cheeks , `` the Lady Tiphaine may have spoken sooth when she said it ; for Twynham Castle is in my heart by day and in my dreams by night. '' '' Ha ! '' cried Sir Nigel , with a sidelong glance . `` Yes , my fair lord ; for indeed I love your daughter , the Lady Maude ; and , unworthy as I am , I would give my heart 's blood to serve her . `` `` By St. Paul ! Edricson , '' said the knight coldly , arching his eyebrows , `` you aim high in this matter . Our blood is very old . `` `` And mine also is very old , '' answered the squire . `` And the Lady Maude is our single child . All our name and lands centre upon her. '' '' Alas ! that I should say it , but I also am now the only Edricson . `` `` And why have I not heard this from you before , Alleyne ? In sooth , I think that you have used me ill. '' '' Nay , my fair lord , say not so ; for I know not whether your daughter loves me , and there is no pledge between us . `` Sir Nigel pondered for a few moments , and then burst out a-laughing . `` By St . Paul ! '' said he , `` I know not why I should mix in the matter ; for I have ever found that the Lady Maud was very well able to look to her own affairs . Since first she could stamp her little foot , she hath ever been able to get that for which she craved ; and if she set her heart on thee , Alleyne , and thou on her , I do not think that this Spanish king , with his three-score thousand men , could hold you apart . Yet this I will say , that I would see you a full knight ere you go to my daughter with words of love . I have ever said that a brave lance should wed her ; and , by my soul ! Edricson , if God spare you , I think that you will acquit yourself well . But enough of such trifles , for we have our work before us , and it will be time to speak of this matter when we see the white cliffs of England once more . Go to Sir William Felton , I pray you , and ask him to come hither , for it is time that we were marching . There is no pass at the further end of the valley , and it is a perilous place should an enemy come upon us . `` Alleyne delivered his message , and then wandered forth from the camp , for his mind was all in a whirl with this unexpected news , and with his talk with Sir Nigel . Sitting upon a rock , with his burning
