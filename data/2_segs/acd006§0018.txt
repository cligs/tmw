the older man answered meekly . `` In considering how to rally under this grievous affliction which has come upon us , we must remember that our credit is a great resource , and one upon which we have never drawn . That gives us a broad margin to help us while we are carrying out our plans for the future . `` `` What will our credit be worth when this matter leaks out ? `` `` But it ca n't leak out . No one suspects it for a moment . They might imagine that we are suffering from some temporary depression of trade , but no one could possibly know the sad truth . For Heaven 's sake do n't you let it out ! `` His son broke into an impatient oath.A flush came into Girdlestone 's sallow cheeks , and his eyes sparkled angrily . `` Be careful how you speak , Ezra . There are limits to what I will endure from you , though I make every allowance for your feelings at this sudden catastrophe , for which I acknowledge myself responsible . `` The young man shrugged his shoulders , and drummed his heel against the ground impatiently . `` I have more than one plan in my head , '' the merchant said , `` by which our affairs may be re-established on their old footing . If we can once get sufficient money to satisfy our present creditors , and so tide over this run of bad luck , the current will set in the other way , and all will go well . And , first of all , there is one question , my boy , which I should like to ask you . What do you think of John Harston 's daughter ? `` `` She 's right enough , '' the young man answered brusquely . `` She 's a good girl , Ezra -- -a thoroughly good girl , and a rich girl too , though her money is a small thing in my eyes compared to her virtue . `` Young Girdlestone sneered . `` Of course , '' he said impatiently . `` Well , go on -- -what about her ? `` `` Just this , Ezra , that there is no girl in the world whom I should like better to receive as my daughter-in-law . Ah , you rogue ! you could come round her ; you know you could . '' The old man poked his long bony finger In the direction of his son 's ribs with grim playfulness . `` Oh , that 's the idea , is it ? '' remarked the junior partner , with a very unpleasant smile . `` Yes , that is one way out of our difficulties . She has forty thousand pounds , which would be more than enough to save the firm . At the same time you would gain a charming wife . `` `` Yes , there are a good many girls about who might make charming wives , '' his son remarked dubiously . `` No matrimony for me yet awhile . `` `` But it is absolutely necessary , '' his father urged . `` A very fine necessity , '' Ezra broke in savagely . `` I am to tie myself up for life and you are to use all the money in rectifying your blunders . It 's a very pretty division of labour , is that . `` `` The business is yours as well as mine . It is your interest to invest the money in it , for if it fails you are as completely ruined as I should be . You think you could win her if you tried ? `` Ezra stroked his dark moustache complacently , and took a momentary glance at his own bold handsome features in the mirror above the fire-place . `` If we are reduced to such an expedient , I think I can answer for the result , '' he said . `` The girl 's not a bad-looking one . But you said you had several plans . Let us hear some of the other ones . If the worst comes to the worst I might consent to that -- -on condition , of course , that I should have the whole management of the money . `` `` Quite so -- -quite so , '' his father said hurriedly . `` That 's a dear , good lad . As you say , when all other things fail we can always fall back upon that . At present I intend to raise as much money as I can upon our credit , and invest it in such a manner as to bring in a large and immediate profit . `` `` And how do you intend to do this ? '' his son asked doubtfully . `` I intend , '' said John Girdlestone , solemnly rising up and leaning his elbow against the mantelpiece -- - '' I intend to make a corner in diamonds . `` John Girdlestone propounded his intention with such dignity and emphasis that he evidently expected the announcement to come as a surprise upon his son . If so , he was not disappointed , for the young man stared open-eyed . `` A corner in diamonds ! '' he repeated . `` How will you do that ? `` `` You know what a corner is , '' his father explained . `` If you buy up all the cotton , say , or sugar in the market , so as to have the whole of it in your own hands , and to be able to put your own price on it in selling it again -- -that is called making a corner in sugar or cotton . I intend to make a corner in diamonds . `` `` Of course , I know what a corner is , '' Ezra said impatiently . `` But how on earth are you going to buy all the diamonds in ? You would want the capital of a Rothschild ? `` `` Not so much as you think , my boy , for there are not any great amount of diamonds in the market at any one time . The yield of the South African fields regulates the price . I have had this idea in my head for some time , and have studied the details . Of course , I should not attempt to buy in all the diamonds that are in the market . A small portion of them would yield profit enough to float the firm off again . `` `` But if you have only a part of the supply in your hands , how are you to regulate the market value ? You must come down to the prices at which other holders are selling. '' '' Ha ! Ha ! Very good ! very good ! '' the old merchant said , shaking his head good-humouredly . `` But you do n't quite see my plan yet . You have not altogether grasped it . Allow me to explain it to you . `` His son lay back upon the sofa with a look of resignation upon his face . Girdlestone continued to stand upon the hearth-rug and spoke very slowly and deliberately , as though giving vent to thoughts which had been long and carefully considered . `` You see , Ezra , '' he said , `` diamonds , being a commodity of great value , of which there is never very much in the market at one time , are extremely sensitive to all sorts of influences . The value of them varies greatly from time to time . A very little thing serves to depreciate their price , and an equally small thing will send it up again . `` Ezra Girdlestone grunted to show that he followed his father 's remarks . `` I did some business in diamonds myself when I was a younger man , and so I had an opportunity of observing their fluctuations in the market . Now , there is one thing which invariably depreciates the price of diamonds . That is the rumour of fresh discoveries of mines in other parts of the world . The instant such a thing gets wind the value of the stones goes down wonderfully . The discovery of diamonds in Central India not long ago had that effect very markedly , and they have never recovered their value since . Do you follow me ? `` An expression of interest had come over Ezra 's face , and he nodded to show that he was listening . `` Now , supposing , '' continued the senior partner , with a smile on his thin lips , `` that such a report got about . Suppose , too , that we were at this time , when the market was in a depressed condition , to invest a considerable capital in them . If these rumours of an alleged discovery turned out to be entirely unfounded , of course the value of the stones which we held would go up once more , and we might very well sell out for double or treble the sum that we invested . Do n't you see the sequence of events ? `` `` There seems to me to be rather too much of the 'suppose ' in it , '' remarked Ezra . `` How do we know that such rumours will get about ; and if they do , how do we know that they will prove to be unfounded ? `` `` How are we to know ? '' the merchant cried , wriggling his long lank body with amusement . `` Why , my lad , if we spread the rumours ourselves we shall have pretty good reason to believe that they are unfounded . Eh , Ezra ? Ha ! ha ! You see there are some brains in the old man yet . `` Ezra looked at his father in considerable surprise and some admiration . `` Why , damn it ! '' he exclaimed , `` it 's dishonest . I 'm not sure that it 's not actionable. '' '' Dishonest ! Pooh ! '' The merchant snapped his fingers . `` It 's finesse , my boy , commercial finesse . Who 's to trace it , I should like to know . I have n't worked out all the details -- -I want your co-operation over that -- -but here 's a rough sketch of my plan . We send a man we can depend upon to some distant part of the world -- -Chimborazo , for example , or the Ural Mountains . It does n't matter where , as long as it is out of the way . On arriving at this place our agent starts a report that he has discovered a diamond mine . We should even go the length , if he considers it necessary , of hiding a few rough stones in the earth , which he can dig up to give colour to his story . Of course the local press would be full of this . He might present one of the diamonds to the editor of the nearest paper . In course of time a pretty coloured description of the new diamond fields would find its way to London and thence to the Cape . I 'll answer for it that the immediate effect is a great drop in the price of stones . We should have a second agent at the Cape diamond fields , and he would lay our money out by buying
