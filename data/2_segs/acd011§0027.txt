and I can bring a dozen to prove it . `` `` That 's your affair , and I guess you can settle it in court to-morrow . Meanwhile , come on , McMurdo , and come quietly if you do n't want a gun across your head . You stand wide , Mr. McGinty ; for I warn you I will stand no resistance when I am on duty ! `` So determined was the appearance of the captain that both McMurdo and his boss were forced to accept the situation . The latter managed to have a few whispered words with the prisoner before they parted . `` What about -- - '' he jerked his thumb upward to signify the coining plant . `` All right , '' whispered McMurdo , who had devised a safe hiding place under the floor . `` I 'll bid you good-bye , '' said the Boss , shaking hands . `` I 'll see Reilly the lawyer and take the defense upon myself . Take my word for it that they wo n't be able to hold you . `` `` I would n't bet on that . Guard the prisoner , you two , and shoot him if he tries any games . I 'll search the house before I leave . `` He did so ; but apparently found no trace of the concealed plant . When he had descended he and his men escorted McMurdo to headquarters . Darkness had fallen , and a keen blizzard was blowing so that the streets were nearly deserted ; but a few loiterers followed the group , and emboldened by invisibility shouted imprecations at the prisoner . `` Lynch the cursed Scowrer ! '' they cried . `` Lynch him ! '' They laughed and jeered as he was pushed into the police station . After a short , formal examination from the inspector in charge he was put into the common cell . Here he found Baldwin and three other criminals of the night before , all arrested that afternoon and waiting their trial next morning.But even within this inner fortress of the law the long arm of the Freemen was able to extend . Late at night there came a jailer with a straw bundle for their bedding , out of which he extracted two bottles of whisky , some glasses , and a pack of cards . They spent a hilarious night , without an anxious thought as to the ordeal of the morning.Nor had they cause , as the result was to show . The magistrate could not possibly , on the evidence , have held them for a higher court . On the one hand the compositors and pressmen were forced to admit that the light was uncertain , that they were themselves much perturbed , and that it was difficult for them to swear to the identity of the assailants ; although they believed that the accused were among them . Cross examined by the clever attorney who had been engaged by McGinty , they were even more nebulous in their evidence.The injured man had already deposed that he was so taken by surprise by the suddenness of the attack that he could state nothing beyond the fact that the first man who struck him wore a moustache . He added that he knew them to be Scowrers , since no one else in the community could possibly have any enmity to him , and he had long been threatened on account of his outspoken editorials . On the other hand , it was clearly shown by the united and unfaltering evidence of six citizens , including that high municipal official , Councillor McGinty , that the men had been at a card party at the Union House until an hour very much later than the commission of the outrage.Needless to say that they were discharged with something very near to an apology from the bench for the inconvenience to which they had been put , together with an implied censure of Captain Marvin and the police for their officious zeal.The verdict was greeted with loud applause by a court in which McMurdo saw many familiar faces . Brothers of the lodge smiled and waved . But there were others who sat with compressed lips and brooding eyes as the men filed out of the dock . One of them , a little , dark-bearded , resolute fellow , put the thoughts of himself and comrades into words as the ex-prisoners passed him . `` You damned murderers ! '' he said . `` We 'll fix you yet ! `` If anything had been needed to give an impetus to Jack McMurdo 's popularity among his fellows it would have been his arrest and acquittal . That a man on the very night of joining the lodge should have done something which brought him before the magistrate was a new record in the annals of the society . Already he had earned the reputation of a good boon companion , a cheery reveller , and withal a man of high temper , who would not take an insult even from the all-powerful Boss himself . But in addition to this he impressed his comrades with the idea that among them all there was not one whose brain was so ready to devise a bloodthirsty scheme , or whose hand would be more capable of carrying it out . `` He 'll be the boy for the clean job , '' said the oldsters to one another , and waited their time until they could set him to his work.McGinty had instruments enough already ; but he recognized that this was a supremely able one . He felt like a man holding a fierce bloodhound in leash . There were curs to do the smaller work ; but some day he would slip this creature upon its prey . A few members of the lodge , Ted Baldwin among them , resented the rapid rise of the stranger and hated him for it ; but they kept clear of him , for he was as ready to fight as to laugh.But if he gained favour with his fellows , there was another quarter , one which had become even more vital to him , in which he lost it . Ettie Shafter 's father would have nothing more to do with him , nor would he allow him to enter the house . Ettie herself was too deeply in love to give him up altogether , and yet her own good sense warned her of what would come from a marriage with a man who was regarded as a criminal.One morning after a sleepless night she determined to see him , possibly for the last time , and make one strong endeavour to draw him from those evil influences which were sucking him down . She went to his house , as he had often begged her to do , and made her way into the room which he used as his sitting-room . He was seated at a table , with his back turned and a letter in front of him . A sudden spirit of girlish mischief came over her -- -she was still only nineteen . He had not heard her when she pushed open the door . Now she tiptoed forward and laid her hand lightly upon his bended shoulders.If she had expected to startle him , she certainly succeeded ; but only in turn to be startled herself . With a tiger spring he turned on her , and his right hand was feeling for her throat . At the same instant with the other hand he crumpled up the paper that lay before him . For an instant he stood glaring . Then astonishment and joy took the place of the ferocity which had convulsed his features -- -a ferocity which had sent her shrinking back in horror as from something which had never before intruded into her gentle life . `` It 's you ! '' said he , mopping his brow . `` And to think that you should come to me , heart of my heart , and I should find nothing better to do than to want to strangle you ! Come then , darling , '' and he held out his arms , `` let me make it up to you . `` But she had not recovered from that sudden glimpse of guilty fear which she had read in the man 's face . All her woman 's instinct told her that it was not the mere fright of a man who is startled . Guilt -- -that was it -- -guilt and fear ! `` What 's come over you , Jack ? '' she cried . `` Why were you so scared of me ? Oh , Jack , if your conscience was at ease , you would not have looked at me like that ! `` `` Sure , I was thinking of other things , and when you came tripping so lightly on those fairy feet of yours -- - '' '' No , no , it was more than that , Jack . '' Then a sudden suspicion seized her . `` Let me see that letter you were writing . `` `` Ah , Ettie , I could n't do that . `` Her suspicions became certainties . `` It 's to another woman , '' she cried . `` I know it ! Why else should you hold it from me ? Was it to your wife that you were writing ? How am I to know that you are not a married man -- -you , a stranger , that nobody knows ? `` `` I am not married , Ettie . See now , I swear it ! You 're the only one woman on earth to me . By the cross of Christ I swear it ! `` He was so white with passionate earnestness that she could not but believe him . `` Well , then , '' she cried , `` why will you not show me the letter ? `` `` I 'll tell you , acushla , '' said he . `` I 'm under oath not to show it , and just as I would n't break my word to you so I would keep it to those who hold my promise . It 's the business of the lodge , and even to you it 's secret . And if I was scared when a hand fell on me , ca n't you understand it when it might have been the hand of a detective ? `` She felt that he was telling the truth . He gathered her into his arms and kissed away her fears and doubts . `` Sit here by me , then . It 's a queer throne for such a queen ; but it 's the best your poor lover can find . He 'll do better for you some of these days , I 'm thinking . Now your mind is easy once again , is it not ? `` `` How can it ever be at ease , Jack , when I know that you are a criminal among criminals , when I never know the day that I may hear you are in court for murder ? 'McMurdo the Scowrer , ' that 's what one of our boarders called you yesterday . It went through my heart like a knife . `` `` Sure , hard words break no bones . `` `` But they were true . `` `` Well , dear , it 's not so bad as you think . We are but
