was devoted to his wife . He loved me to come here , and was forever sending for me . And yet if his wife and I talked together or there seemed any sympathy between us , a kind of wave of jealousy would pass over him , and he would be off the handle and saying the wildest things in a moment . More than once I 've sworn off coming for that reason , and then he would write me such penitent , imploring letters that I just had to . But you can take it from me , gentlemen , if it was my last word , that no man ever had a more loving , faithful wife -- -and I can say also no friend could be more loyal than I ! `` It was spoken with fervour and feeling , and yet Inspector MacDonald could not dismiss the subject . `` You are aware , '' said he , `` that the dead man 's wedding ring has been taken from his finger ? `` `` So it appears , '' said Barker . `` What do you mean by 'appears ' ? You know it as a fact . `` The man seemed confused and undecided . `` When I said 'appears ' I meant that it was conceivable that he had himself taken off the ring . `` `` The mere fact that the ring should be absent , whoever may have removed it , would suggest to anyone 's mind , would it not , that the marriage and the tragedy were connected ? `` Barker shrugged his broad shoulders . `` I ca n't profess to say what it means , '' he answered . `` But if you mean to hint that it could reflect in any way upon this lady 's honour '' -- -his eyes blazed for an instant , and then with an evident effort he got a grip upon his own emotions -- - '' well , you are on the wrong track , that 's all . `` `` I do n't know that I 've anything else to ask you at present , '' said MacDonald , coldly . `` There was one small point , '' remarked Sherlock Holmes . `` When you entered the room there was only a candle lighted on the table , was there not ? `` `` Yes , that was so . `` `` By its light you saw that some terrible incident had occurred ? '' '' Exactly . `` `` You at once rang for help ? '' '' Yes . `` `` And it arrived very speedily ? `` `` Within a minute or so . `` `` And yet when they arrived they found that the candle was out and that the lamp had been lighted . That seems very remarkable . `` Again Barker showed some signs of indecision . `` I do n't see that it was remarkable , Mr. Holmes , '' he answered after a pause . `` The candle threw a very bad light . My first thought was to get a better one . The lamp was on the table ; so I lit it . `` `` And blew out the candle ? '' '' Exactly . `` Holmes asked no further question , and Barker , with a deliberate look from one to the other of us , which had , as it seemed to me , something of defiance in it , turned and left the room.Inspector MacDonald had sent up a note to the effect that he would wait upon Mrs. Douglas in her room ; but she had replied that she would meet us in the dining room . She entered now , a tall and beautiful woman of thirty , reserved and self-possessed to a remarkable degree , very different from the tragic and distracted figure I had pictured . It is true that her face was pale and drawn , like that of one who has endured a great shock ; but her manner was composed , and the finely moulded hand which she rested upon the edge of the table was as steady as my own . Her sad , appealing eyes travelled from one to the other of us with a curiously inquisitive expression . That questioning gaze transformed itself suddenly into abrupt speech . `` Have you found anything out yet ? '' she asked.Was it my imagination that there was an undertone of fear rather than of hope in the question ? `` We have taken every possible step , Mrs. Douglas , '' said the inspector . `` You may rest assured that nothing will be neglected . `` `` Spare no money , '' she said in a dead , even tone . `` It is my desire that every possible effort should be made . `` `` Perhaps you can tell us something which may throw some light upon the matter . `` `` I fear not ; but all I know is at your service . `` `` We have heard from Mr. Cecil Barker that you did not actually see -- -that you were never in the room where the tragedy occurred ? `` `` No , he turned me back upon the stairs . He begged me to return to my room . `` `` Quite so . You had heard the shot , and you had at once come down . `` `` I put on my dressing gown and then came down . `` `` How long was it after hearing the shot that you were stopped on the stair by Mr . Barker ? `` `` It may have been a couple of minutes . It is so hard to reckon time at such a moment . He implored me not to go on . He assured me that I could do nothing . Then Mrs. Allen , the housekeeper , led me upstairs again . It was all like some dreadful dream . `` `` Can you give us any idea how long your husband had been downstairs before you heard the shot ? `` `` No , I can not say . He went from his dressing room , and I did not hear him go . He did the round of the house every night , for he was nervous of fire . It is the only thing that I have ever known him nervous of . `` `` That is just the point which I want to come to , Mrs. Douglas . You have known your husband only in England , have you not ? `` `` Yes , we have been married five years . `` `` Have you heard him speak of anything which occurred in America and might bring some danger upon him ? '' Mrs . Douglas thought earnestly before she answered . `` Yes , '' she said at last , `` I have always felt that there was a danger hanging over him . He refused to discuss it with me . It was not from want of confidence in me -- -there was the most complete love and confidence between us -- -but it was out of his desire to keep all alarm away from me . He thought I should brood over it if I knew all , and so he was silent . `` `` How did you know it , then ? '' Mrs . Douglas 's face lit with a quick smile . `` Can a husband ever carry about a secret all his life and a woman who loves him have no suspicion of it ? I knew it by his refusal to talk about some episodes in his American life . I knew it by certain precautions he took . I knew it by certain words he let fall . I knew it by the way he looked at unexpected strangers . I was perfectly certain that he had some powerful enemies , that he believed they were on his track , and that he was always on his guard against them . I was so sure of it that for years I have been terrified if ever he came home later than was expected . `` `` Might I ask , '' asked Holmes , `` what the words were which attracted your attention ? `` `` The Valley of Fear , '' the lady answered . `` That was an expression he has used when I questioned him . 'I have been in the Valley of Fear . I am not out of it yet . ' -- -'Are we never to get out of the Valley of Fear ? ' I have asked him when I have seen him more serious than usual . 'Sometimes I think that we never shall , ' he has answered . `` `` Surely you asked him what he meant by the Valley of Fear ? `` `` I did ; but his face would become very grave and he would shake his head . 'It is bad enough that one of us should have been in its shadow , ' he said . 'Please God it shall never fall upon you ! ' It was some real valley in which he had lived and in which something terrible had occurred to him , of that I am certain ; but I can tell you no more . `` `` And he never mentioned any names ? `` `` Yes , he was delirious with fever once when he had his hunting accident three years ago . Then I remember that there was a name that came continually to his lips . He spoke it with anger and a sort of horror . McGinty was the name -- -Bodymaster McGinty . I asked him when he recovered who Bodymaster McGinty was , and whose body he was master of . 'Never of mine , thank God ! ' he answered with a laugh , and that was all I could get from him . But there is a connection between Bodymaster McGinty and the Valley of Fear . `` `` There is one other point , '' said Inspector MacDonald . `` You met Mr. Douglas in a boarding house in London , did you not , and became engaged to him there ? Was there any romance , anything secret or mysterious , about the wedding ? `` `` There was romance . There is always romance . There was nothing mysterious . `` `` He had no rival ? `` `` No , I was quite free . `` `` You have heard , no doubt , that his wedding ring has been taken . Does that suggest anything to you ? Suppose that some enemy of his old life had tracked him down and committed this crime , what possible reason could he have for taking his wedding ring ? `` For an instant I could have sworn that the faintest shadow of a smile flickered over the woman 's lips . `` I really can not tell , '' she answered . `` It is certainly a most extraordinary thing . `` `` Well , we will not detain you any longer , and we are sorry to have put you to this trouble at such a time , '' said the inspector . `` There are some other points , no doubt ; but we can refer to you as they arise . `` She rose , and I was again conscious of that quick , questioning glance with which she had just surveyed us . `` What impression has my evidence made upon you ? '' The question might as well have been spoken
