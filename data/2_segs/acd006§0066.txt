's manner was an additional cause for cheerfulness . She almost persuaded herself that she had misconstrued his words and his intentions upon the preceding day.She went down the avenue and had a few words with the sentry there . She felt no bitterness against him now -- -on the contrary , she could afford to laugh at his peculiarities . He was in a very bad humour on account of some domestic difficulties . His wife had been abusing him , and had ended by assaulting him . `` She used to argey first , and then fetch the poker , '' he said ruefully ; `` but now it 's the poker first , and there ai n't no argeyment at all . `` Kate looked at his savage face and burly figure , and thought what a very courageous woman his wife must be . `` It 's all 'cause the fisher lasses wo n't lem me alone , '' he explained with a leer . `` She do n't like it , knock me sideways if she do ! It ai n't my fault , though . I allers had a kind o ' a fetchin ' way wi ' women . `` `` Did you post my note ? '' asked Kate . `` Yes , in course I did , '' he answered . `` It 'll be in Lunnon now , most like . '' His one eye moved about in such a very shifty way as he spoke that she was convinced that he was telling a lie . She could not be sufficiently thankful that she had something else to rely upon besides the old scoundrel 's assurances.There was nothing to be seen down the lane except a single cart with a loutish young man walking at the horse 's head . She had a horror of the country folk since her encounter with the two bumpkins upon the Sunday . She therefore slipped away from the gate , and went through the wood to the shed , which she mounted . On the other side of the wall there was standing a little boy in buttons , so rigid and motionless that he might have been one of Madame Tussaud 's figures , were it not for his eyes , which were rolling about in every direction , and which finally fixed themselves on Kate 's face . `` Good morning , miss , '' said this apparition . `` Good morning , '' she answered . `` I think I saw you with Mrs. Scully yesterday ? `` `` Yes , miss . Missus , she told me to wait here and never to move until I seed you . She said as you would be sure to come . I 've been waitin ' here for nigh on an hour . `` `` Your mistress is an angel , '' Kate said enthusiastically , `` and you are a very good little boy . `` `` Indeed , you 've hit it about the missus , '' said the youth , in a hoarse whisper , nodding his head to emphasize his remarks . `` She 's got a heart as is big enough for three . `` Kate could not help smiling at the enthusiasm with which the little fellow spoke . `` You seem fond of her , '' she said . `` I 'd be a bad 'un if I was n't . She took me out of the work'us without character or nothing , and now she 's a-educatin ' of me . She sent me 'ere with a message ? `` `` What was it ? `` `` She said as how she had written instead o ' electro-telegraphing , 'cause she had so much to say she could n't fit it all on a telegraph . `` `` I thought that would be so , '' Kate said . `` She wrote to Major -- -Major -- -him as is a-follerin ' of her . She said as she had no doubt as he 'd be down to-day , and you was to keep up your sperrits and let her know by me if any one was a-wexin ' you . `` `` No , no . Not at all , '' Kate answered , smiling again . `` You can tell her that my guardian has been much kinder to-day . I am full of hope now . Give her my warmest thanks for her kindness . `` `` All right , miss . Say , that chap at the gate has n't been giving you no cheek has he -- -him with the game eye ? `` `` No , no , John . `` John looked at her suspiciously . `` If he has n't , it 's all right , '' he said ; `` but I think as you 're one of them as do n't complain if you can 'elp it . '' He opened his hand and showed a great jagged flint which he carried . `` I 'd ha ' knocked his other peeper out with this , '' he said , `` blowed if I would n't ! `` `` Do n't do anything of the sort , John , but run home like a good little boy . `` `` All right , miss . Good-bye to ye ! `` Kate watched him stroll down the lane . He paused at the bottom as if irresolute , and then she was relieved to see him throw the stone over into a turnip field , and walk rapidly off in the opposite direction to the Priory gates.Late in the afternoon Ezra arrived at the Priory . From one of the passage windows Kate saw him driving up the avenue in a high dog-cart . There was a broad-shouldered , red-bearded man sitting beside him , and the ostler from theFlying Bullwas perched behind . Kate had rushed to the window on hearing the sound of wheels , with some dim expectation that her friends had come sooner than she anticipated . A glance , however , showed her that the hope was vain . From behind a curtain she watched them alight and come into the house , while the trap wheeled round and rattled off for Bedsworth again.She went slowly back to her room , wondering what friend this could be whom Ezra had brought with him . She had noticed that he was roughly clad , presenting a contrast to the young merchant , who was vulgarly spruce in his attire . Evidently he intended to pass the night at the Priory , since they had let the trap go back to the village . She was glad that he had come , for his presence would act as a restraint upon the Girdlestones . In spite of her guardian 's amiability at breakfast , she could not forget the words which he had used the morning before or the incident of the poison bottle . She was as convinced as ever that he meant mischief to her , but she had ceased to fear him . It never for one moment occurred to her that her guardian 's machinations might come to a head before her rescuers could arrive.As the long afternoon stole away she became more and more impatient and expectant . She had been sewing in her room , but she found that she could no longer keep her attention on the stitches . She paced nervously up and down the little apartment . In the room beneath she could hear the dull muffled sound of men 's voices in a long continuous monotone , broken only by the interposition now and again of one voice which was so deep and loud that it reminded her of the growl of a beast of prey . This must belong to the red-bearded stranger . Kate wondered what it could be that they were talking over so earnestly . City affairs , no doubt , or other business matters of importance . She remembered having once heard it remarked that many of the richest men on 'Change were eccentric and slovenly in their dress , so the new-comer might be a more important person than he seemed.She had determined to remain in her room all the afternoon to avoid Ezra , but her restlessness was so great that she felt feverish and hot . The fresh air , she thought , would have a reviving effect upon her . She slipped down the staircase , treading as lightly as possible not to disturb the gentlemen in the refectory . They appeared to hear her however , for the hum of conversation died away , and there was a dead silence until after she had passed.She went out on to the little lawn which lay in front of the old house . There were some flower-beds scattered about on it , but they were overgrown with weeds and in the last stage of neglect . She amused herself by attempting to improve the condition of one of them and kneeling down beside it she pulled up a number of the weeds which covered it . There was a withered rose-bush in the centre , so she pulled up that also , and succeeded in imparting some degree of order among the few plants which remained . She worked with unnatural energy , pausing every now and again to glance down the dark avenue , or to listen intently to any chance sound which might catch her ear.In the course of her work she chanced to look up at the Priory . The refectory faced the lawn , and at the window of it there stood the three men looking out at her . The Girdlestones were nodding their heads , as though they were pointing her out to the third man , who stood between them . He was looking at her with an expression of interest . Kate thought as she returned his gaze that she had never seen a more savage and brutal face . He was flushed and laughing , while Ezra beside him appeared to be pale and anxious . They all , when they saw that she noticed them , stepped precipitately back from the window . She had only a momentary glance at them , and yet the three faces -- -the strange fierce red one , and the two hard familiar pale ones which flanked it -- -remained vividly impressed upon her memory.Girdlestone had been so pleased at the early appearance of his allies , and the prospect of settling the matter once for all , that he received them with a cordiality which was foreign to his nature . `` Always punctual , my dear son , and always to be relied upon , '' he said . `` You are a model to our young business men . As to you , Mr. Burt , '' he continued , grasping the navvy 's horny hand , `` I am delighted to see you at the Priory , much as I regret the sad necessity which has brought you down . `` `` Talk it over afterwards , '' said Ezra shortly . `` Burt and I have had no luncheon yet . `` `` I am cursed near starved , '' the other growled , throwing himself into a chair . Ezra had been careful to keep him from drink on the way down , and he was now sober , or as nearly sober as a brain saturated with liquor could ever be.Girdlestone called for Mrs. Jorrocks , who laid the cloth and put a piece of cold corned beef and a jug of beer upon the table . Ezra appeared
