, '' said I . `` I suppose you have heard nothing of the great shipwreck ? `` `` Not a word , '' the general answered listlessly . `` I thought the noise of the wind would prevent you hearing the signal guns . She came ashore in the bay the night before last -- -a great barque from India . `` `` From India ! '' ejaculated the general. '' Yes . Her crew were saved , fortunately , and have all been sent on to Glasgow . `` `` All sent on ! '' cried the general , with a face as bloodless as a corpse . `` All except three rather strange characters who claim to be Buddhist priests . They have decided to remain for a few days upon the coast . `` The words were hardly out of my mouth when the general dropped upon his knees with his long , thin arms extended to Heaven . `` Thy will be done ! '' he cried in a cracking voice . `` Thy blessed will be done ! `` I could see through the crack that Corporal Rufus Smith 's face had turned to a sickly yellow shade , and that he was wiping the perspiration from his brow . `` It 's like my luck ! '' he said . `` After all these years , to come when I have got a snug billet . `` `` Never mind , my lad , '' the general said , rising , and squaring his shoulders like a man who braces himself up for an effort . `` Be it what it may we 'll face it as British soldiers should . D 'ye remember at Chillianwallah , when you had to run from your guns to our square , and the Sikh horse came thundering down on our bayonets ? We did n't flinch then , and we wo n't flinch now . It seems to me that I feel better than I have done for years . It was the uncertainty that was killing me . `` `` And the infernal jingle-jangle , '' said the corporal . `` Well , we all go together -- -that 's some consolation . `` `` Good-bye , West , '' said the general . `` Be a good husband to Gabriel , and give my poor wife a home . I do n't think she will trouble you long . Good-bye ! God bless you ! `` `` Look here , General , '' I said , peremptorily breaking off a piece of wood to make communication more easy , `` this sort of thing has been going on too long . What are these hints and allusions and innuendoes ? It is time we had a little plain speaking . What is it you fear ? Out with it ! Are you in dread of these Hindoos ? If you are , I am able , on my father 's authority , to have them arrested as rogues and vagabonds . `` `` No , no , that would never do , '' he answered , shaking his head . `` You will learn about the wretched business soon enough . Mordaunt knows where to lay his hand upon the papers bearing on the matter . You can consult him about it to-morrow . `` `` But surely , '' I cried , `` if the peril is so imminent something may be done to avert it . If you would but tell me what you fear I should know how to act . `` `` My dear friend , '' he said , `` there is nothing to be done , so calm yourself , and let things take their course . It has been folly on my part to shelter myself behind mere barriers of wood and stone . The fact is , that inaction was terrible to me , and I felt that to do anything , however futile , in the nature of a precaution , was better than passive resignation . My humble friend here and I have placed ourselves in a position in which , I trust , no poor fellow will ever find himself again . We can only recommend ourselves to the unfailing goodness of the Almighty , and trust that what we have endured in this world may lessen our atonement in the world to come . I must leave you now , for I have many papers to destroy and much to arrange . Good-bye ! `` He pushed his hand through the hole which I had made , and grasped mine in a solemn farewell , after which he walked back to the Hall with a firm and decided step , still followed by the crippled and sinister corporal.I walked back to Branksome much disturbed by this interview , and extremely puzzled as to what course I should pursue.It was evident now that my sister 's suspicions were correct , and that there was some very intimate connection between the presence of the three Orientals and the mysterious peril which hung over the towers of Cloomber.It was difficult for me to associate the noble-faced Ram Singh 's gentle , refined manner and words of wisdom with any deed of violence , yet now that I thought of it I could see that a terrible capacity for wrath lay behind his shaggy brows and dark , piercing eyes.I felt that of all men whom I had ever met he was the one whose displeasure I should least care to face . But how could two men so widely dissociated as the foul-mouthed old corporal of artillery and the distinguished Anglo-Indian general have each earned the ill-will of these strange castaways ? And if the danger were a positive physical one , why should he not consent to my proposal to have the three men placed under custody -- -though I confess it would have gone much against my grain to act in so inhospitable a manner upon such vague and shadowy grounds.These questions were absolutely unanswerable , and yet the solemn words and the terrible gravity which I had seen in the faces of both the old soldiers forbade me from thinking that their fears were entirely unfounded.It was all a puzzle -- -an absolutely insoluble puzzle.One thing at least was clear to me -- -and that was that in the present state of my knowledge , and after the general 's distinct prohibition , it was impossible for me to interfere in any way . I could only wait and pray that , whatever the danger might be , it might pass over , or at least that my dear Gabriel and her brother might be protected against it.I was walking down the lane lost in thought , and had got as far as the wicket gate which opens upon the Branksome lawn , when I was surprised to hear my father 's voice raised in most animated and excited converse.The old man had been of late so abstracted from the daily affairs of the world , and so absorbed in his own special studies , that it was difficult to engage his attention upon any ordinary , mundane topic . Curious to know what it was that had drawn him so far out of himself , I opened the gate softly , and walking quietly round the laurel bushes , found him sitting , to my astonishment , with none other than the very man who was occupying my thoughts , Ram Singh , the Buddhist.The two were sitting upon a garden bench , and the Oriental appeared to be laying down some weighty proposition , checking every point upon his long , quivering , brown fingers , while my father , with his hands thrown abroad and his face awry , was loud in protestation and in argument.So absorbed were they in their controversy , that I stood within a hand-touch of them for a minute or more before they became conscious of my presence.On observing me the priest sprang to his feet and greeted me with the same lofty courtesy and dignified grace which had so impressed me the day before . `` I promised myself yesterday , '' he said , `` the pleasure of calling upon your father . You see I have kept my word . I have even been daring enough to question his views upon some points in connection with the Sanscrit and Hindoo tongues , with the result that we have been arguing for an hour or more without either of us convincing the other . Without pretending to as deep a theoretical knowledge as that which has made the name of James Hunter West a household word among Oriental scholars , I happen to have given considerable attention to this one point , and indeed I am in a position to say that I know his views to be unsound . I assure you , sir , that up to the year 700 , or even later , Sanscrit was the ordinary language of the great bulk of the inhabitants of India . `` `` And I assure you , sir , '' said my father warmly , `` that it was dead and forgotten at that date , save by the learned , who used it as a vehicle for scientific and religious works -- -just as Latin was used in the Middle Ages long after it had ceased to be spoken by any European nation . `` `` If you consult the puranas you will find , '' said Ram Singh , `` that this theory , though commonly received , is entirely untenable . `` `` And if you will consult the Ramayana , and more particularly the canonical books on Buddhist discipline , '' cried my father , `` you will find that the theory is unassailable . `` `` But look at the Kullavagga , '' said our visitor earnestly . `` And look at King Asoka , '' shouted my father triumphantly . `` When , in the year 300 before the Christian era -- -before , mind you -- -he ordered the laws of Buddha to be engraved upon the rocks , what language did he employ , eh ? Was it Sanscrit ? -- -no ! And why was it not Sanscrit ? Because the lower orders of his subjects would not have been able to understand a word of it . Ha , ha ! That was the reason . How are you going to get round King Asoka 's edicts , eh ? `` `` He carved them in the various dialects , '' Ram Singh answered . `` But energy is too precious a thing to be wasted in mere wind in this style . The sun has passed its meridian , and I must return to my companions . `` `` I am sorry that you have not brought them to see us , '' said my father courteously . He was , I could see , uneasy lest in the eagerness of debate he had overstepped the bounds of hospitality . `` They do not mix with the world , '' Ram Singh answered , rising to his feet . `` They are of a higher grade than I , and more sensitive to contaminating influences . They are immersed in a six months ' meditation upon the mystery of the third incarnation , which has lasted with few intermissions from the time that we left the Himalayas . I shall not see you again , Mr. Hunter West , and I therefore bid you farewell . Your old age will be a happy one , as it deserves to be , and your Eastern studies will have a
