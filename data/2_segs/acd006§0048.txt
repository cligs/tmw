in the general effect . `` The captain , '' he continued , `` has been far from salubrious this voyage.He 's aye complainin ' o ' his bodily infirmities . `` `` Hypochondriacal , perhaps , '' Tom remarked.The Scotchman looked at his companion with a great accession of respect . `` My certie ! '' he cried . `` That 's the best I 've heard since a word thatJimmy M'Gee , of theCorisco , said the voyage afore last . Would youkindly arteeculate it again . `` `` Hypochondriacal , '' said Tom laughing heartily . `` Hypo-chon-driacal , '' the mate repeated slowly . `` I should n't think Jimmy M'Gee kens that , or he 'd ha ' communicated it to me . I shall certainly utilize it , and am obleeged to you for namin ' it . `` `` Do n't mention it , '' said Tom . `` I 'll let you have as many long words as you like , if you are a collector of them . But what is the matter with the captain ? `` `` It 's aye the drink , '' the mate said gravely . `` I can tak ' my modicum mysel ' and enjoy it , but that 's no the same as for a man to lock himself up in his cabin , and drink rum steady on from four bells in the mornin ' watch to eight bells in the evenin ' . And then the cussin ' , and prayin ' , and swearin ' as he sets up is just awfu ' . It 's what might weel be described as pandemoniacal . `` `` Is he often like that , then ? '' Tom asked. '' Often ! Why , he 's never anything else , sir . And yet he 's a good seaman too , and however fu ' he may be , he keeps some form o ' reckoning , and never vera far oot either . He 's an ambeequosity to me , sir , for if I took a tithe o ' the amount I 'd be clean daft . `` `` He must be dangerous when he is like that ? '' Tom remarked . `` He is that . He emptied a sax-shooter down the deck last bout he had , and nigh perforated the carpenter . Another time he scoots after the cook -- -chased him with a handspike in his hand right up the rigging to the cross-trees . If the cook had n't slid down the backstay of the mast , he 'd ha ' been obeetuarised . `` Tom could not refrain from laughing at the last expression . `` That 's a new word , '' he said. '' Ha ! '' his companion cried with great satisfaction , `` it is , is it ? Then we are quits now on the hypochondriacal . '' He was so pleased that he chuckled to himself for some minutes in the depths of his tawny beard . `` Yes , '' he continued at last , `` he is dangerous to us at times , and he is dangerous to you . This is atween oorsels , as man to man , and is said withoot prejudice , but he do go on when he is in they fits aboot the firm , and aboot insurances , and rotten ships , and ither such things , which is all vera well when sequestrated amang gentlemen like oorsels , but sounds awfu ' bad when it fa 's on the ignorant tympanums of common seamen . `` `` It 's scandalous , '' Tom said gravely , `` that he should spread such reports about his employer . Our ships are old , and some of them , in my opinion , hardly safe , but that 's a very different thing from implying , as you hint , that Mr. Girdlestone wishes them to go down . `` `` We 'll no argue aboot that , '' said the canny Scot . `` Muster Girdlestone kens on which side his bread is buttered . He may wish 'em to sink or he may wish 'em to swim . That 's no for us to judge . You 'll hear him speak o't to-night as like as not , for he 's aye on it when he 's half over . Here we are , sir . The corner edifice wi ' the red blinds in the window . `` During this conversation the two had been threading their way through the intricate and dirty lanes which lead up from the water side to the outskirts of Stepney . It was quite dark by the time that they reached a long thoroughfare , lined by numerous shops , with great gas flares outside them . Many of these belonged to dealers in marine stores , and the numerous suits of oil-skin , hung up for exhibition , swung to and fro in the uncertain light , like rows of attenuated pirates . At every corner was a great public-house with glittering windows , and a crowd of slatternly women and jersey-clad men elbowing each other at the door . At the largest and most imposing of these gin-palaces the mate and Dimsdale now pulled up . `` Come in this way , '' said McPherson , who had evidently paid many a visit there before . Pushing open a swinging door , he made his way into the crowded bar , where the reek of bad spirits and the smell of squalid humanity seemed to Tom to be even more horrible than the effluvium of the grease-laden hold . `` Captain Miggs in ? '' asked McPherson of a rubicund , white-aproned personage behind the bar . `` Yes , sir . He 's in his room , sir , and expectin ' you . There 's a gent with him , sir , but he told me to send you up . This way , sir . `` They were pushing their way through the crowd to reach the door which led behind the bar , when Tom 's attention was arrested by the conversation of a very seedy-looking individual who was leaning with his elbows upon the zinc-covered counter . `` You take my tip , '' he said to an elderly man beside him . `` You stick to the beer . The sperits in here is clean poison , and it 's a sin and a shame as they should be let sell such stuff to Christian men . See here -- -see my sleeve ! '' He showed the threadbare cuff of his coat , which was corroded away in one part , as by a powerful acid . `` I give ye my word I done that by wiping my lips wi ' it two or three times after drinkin ' at this bar . That was afore I found out that the whisky was solid vitriol . If thread and cotton ca n't stand it , how 's the linin ' of a poor cove 's stomach , I 'd like to know ? `` `` I wonder , '' thought Tom to himself , `` if one of these poor devils goes home and murders his wife , who ought to be hung for it ? Is it he , or that smug-faced villain behind the bar , who , for the sake of the gain of a few greasy coppers , gives him the poison that maddens him ? '' He was still pondering over this knotty point when they were ushered into the captain 's room.That worthy was leaning back in a rocking-chair with his feet perched upon the mantelpiece and a large glass of rum arid water within reach of his great leathery hand . Opposite him , in a similar chair and with a similar glass , was no less an individual than our old acquaintance , Von Baumser . As a mercantile clerk in the London office of a Hamburg firm the German was thrown into contact with the shippers of the African fleet , and had contracted a special alliance with the bibulous Miggs , who was a social soul in his hours of relaxation . `` Come in , my hearties , come in ! '' he cried huskily . `` Take a seat , Mr.Dimsdale . And you , Sandy , ca n't you bring yourself to your berthwithout being asked ? You should know your moorings by this time.This is my friend , Mr . Von Baumser from Eckermann 's office . `` `` And dis , I think , is Mr. Dimsdale , '' said the German , shaking hands with Tom . `` I have heard my very goot vriend , Major Clutterbuck , speak of your name , sir . `` `` Ah , the old major , '' Tom answered . `` Of course , I remember him well . `` `` He is not so very old either , '' said Von Baumser , in a somewhat surly voice . `` He has been took by a very charming and entirely pleasant woman , and they are about to be married before three months , the one to the other . Let me tell you , sir , I , who have lived with him so long , dat I have met no man for whom I have greater respect than for the major , however much they give him pills at a club or other such snobberies . `` `` Fill your glasses , '' Miggs broke in , pushing over the bottle of rum . `` There are weeds in that box -- -never paid duty , either the one or the other . By the Lord , Sandy , a couple of days ago we hardly hoped ever to be yarning here . `` `` It was rather beyond our prognostication , sir , '' said the mate , taking a pull at his rum . `` It was that ! A nasty sea on , Mr. Dimsdale , sir , and the old ship so full o ' water that she could not rise to it . They were making a clean breach over us , and we lost nigh everything we could lose . `` `` I suppose you 'll have her thoroughly repaired now ? '' Tom remarked.Both the skipper and the mate laughed heartily at the observation . `` That would n't do , Sandy , would it ? '' said Miggs , shaking his head . `` We could n't afford to have our screw cut down like that . `` `` Cut down ! You do n't mean to say you are paid in proportion to the rottenness of the ships ? `` `` There ai n't no use makin ' a secret of it among friends , '' said Miggs . `` That 's just how the land lies with us . A voyage or two back I spoke to Mr. Girdlestone , and I says to him , says I , 'Give the ship an overhauling , ' says I . 'Well and good , ' says he , 'but it will mean so much off your wage , ' says he , 'and the mate 's wage as well . ' I put it to him straight and strong , but he stuck at that . So Sandy and me , we put our heads together , and we 'greed It was better to take fifteen pound and the risk , than come down to twelve pound and safety . `` `` It is scandalous ! '' cried Tom Dimsdale hotly . `` I
