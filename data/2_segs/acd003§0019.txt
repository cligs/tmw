a very grave responsibility upon myself in doing this . It is most irregular ; but of course an agreement is an agreement . I must , however , as a matter of duty , send an inspector with you , since you have so valuable a charge . You will drive , no doubt ? `` `` Yes , I shall drive . `` `` It is a pity there is no key , that we may make an inventory first . You will have to break it open . Where is the key , my man ? `` `` At the bottom of the river , '' said Small , shortly. '' Hum ! There was no use your giving this unnecessary trouble . We have had work enough already through you . However , doctor , I need not warn you to be careful . Bring the box back with you to the Baker Street rooms . You will find us there , on our way to the station . `` They landed me at Vauxhall , with my heavy iron box , and with a bluff , genial inspector as my companion . A quarter of an hour 's drive brought us to Mrs. Cecil Forrester 's . The servant seemed surprised at so late a visitor . Mrs. Cecil Forrester was out for the evening , she explained , and likely to be very late . Miss Morstan , however , was in the drawing-room : so to the drawing-room I went , box in hand , leaving the obliging inspector in the cab.She was seated by the open window , dressed in some sort of white diaphanous material , with a little touch of scarlet at the neck and waist . The soft light of a shaded lamp fell upon her as she leaned back in the basket chair , playing over her sweet , grave face , and tinting with a dull , metallic sparkle the rich coils of her luxuriant hair . One white arm and hand drooped over the side of the chair , and her whole pose and figure spoke of an absorbing melancholy . At the sound of my foot-fall she sprang to her feet , however , and a bright flush of surprise and of pleasure colored her pale cheeks . `` I heard a cab drive up , '' she said . `` I thought that Mrs. Forrester had come back very early , but I never dreamed that it might be you . What news have you brought me ? `` `` I have brought something better than news , '' said I , putting down the box upon the table and speaking jovially and boisterously , though my heart was heavy within me . `` I have brought you something which is worth all the news in the world . I have brought you a fortune . `` She glanced at the iron box . `` Is that the treasure , then ? '' she asked , coolly enough . `` Yes , this is the great Agra treasure . Half of it is yours and half is Thaddeus Sholto 's . You will have a couple of hundred thousand each . Think of that ! An annuity of ten thousand pounds . There will be few richer young ladies in England . Is it not glorious ? `` I think that I must have been rather overacting my delight , and that she detected a hollow ring in my congratulations , for I saw her eyebrows rise a little , and she glanced at me curiously . `` If I have it , '' said she , `` I owe it to you . `` `` No , no , '' I answered , `` not to me , but to my friend Sherlock Holmes . With all the will in the world , I could never have followed up a clue which has taxed even his analytical genius . As it was , we very nearly lost it at the last moment . `` `` Pray sit down and tell me all about it , Dr. Watson , '' said she.I narrated briefly what had occurred since I had seen her last , -- -Holmes 's new method of search , the discovery of the Aurora , the appearance of Athelney Jones , our expedition in the evening , and the wild chase down the Thames . She listened with parted lips and shining eyes to my recital of our adventures . When I spoke of the dart which had so narrowly missed us , she turned so white that I feared that she was about to faint . `` It is nothing , '' she said , as I hastened to pour her out some water . `` I am all right again . It was a shock to me to hear that I had placed my friends in such horrible peril . `` `` That is all over , '' I answered . `` It was nothing . I will tell you no more gloomy details . Let us turn to something brighter . There is the treasure . What could be brighter than that ? I got leave to bring it with me , thinking that it would interest you to be the first to see it . `` `` It would be of the greatest interest to me , '' she said . There was no eagerness in her voice , however . It had struck her , doubtless , that it might seem ungracious upon her part to be indifferent to a prize which had cost so much to win . `` What a pretty box ! '' she said , stooping over it . `` This is Indian work , I suppose ? `` `` Yes ; it is Benares metal-work . `` `` And so heavy ! '' she exclaimed , trying to raise it . `` The box alone must be of some value . Where is the key ? `` `` Small threw it into the Thames , '' I answered . `` I must borrow Mrs. Forrester 's poker . '' There was in the front a thick and broad hasp , wrought in the image of a sitting Buddha . Under this I thrust the end of the poker and twisted it outward as a lever . The hasp sprang open with a loud snap . With trembling fingers I flung back the lid . We both stood gazing in astonishment . The box was empty ! No wonder that it was heavy . The iron-work was two-thirds of an inch thick all round . It was massive , well made , and solid , like a chest constructed to carry things of great price , but not one shred or crumb of metal or jewelry lay within it . It was absolutely and completely empty . `` The treasure is lost , '' said Miss Morstan , calmly.As I listened to the words and realized what they meant , a great shadow seemed to pass from my soul . I did not know how this Agra treasure had weighed me down , until now that it was finally removed . It was selfish , no doubt , disloyal , wrong , but I could realize nothing save that the golden barrier was gone from between us . `` Thank God ! '' I ejaculated from my very heart.She looked at me with a quick , questioning smile . `` Why do you say that ? '' she asked . `` Because you are within my reach again , '' I said , taking her hand . She did not withdraw it . `` Because I love you , Mary , as truly as ever a man loved a woman . Because this treasure , these riches , sealed my lips . Now that they are gone I can tell you how I love you . That is why I said , 'Thank God . ' '' '' Then I say , 'Thank God , ' too , '' she whispered , as I drew her to my side . Whoever had lost a treasure , I knew that night that I had gained one.A very patient man was that inspector in the cab , for it was a weary time before I rejoined him . His face clouded over when I showed him the empty box . `` There goes the reward ! '' said he , gloomily . `` Where there is no money there is no pay . This night 's work would have been worth a tenner each to Sam Brown and me if the treasure had been there. '' '' Mr . Thaddeus Sholto is a rich man , '' I said . `` He will see that you are rewarded , treasure or no . `` The inspector shook his head despondently , however . `` It 's a bad job , '' he repeated ; `` and so Mr. Athelney Jones will think . `` His forecast proved to be correct , for the detective looked blank enough when I got to Baker Street and showed him the empty box . They had only just arrived , Holmes , the prisoner , and he , for they had changed their plans so far as to report themselves at a station upon the way . My companion lounged in his arm-chair with his usual listless expression , while Small sat stolidly opposite to him with his wooden leg cocked over his sound one . As I exhibited the empty box he leaned back in his chair and laughed aloud . `` This is your doing , Small , '' said Athelney Jones , angrily . `` Yes , I have put it away where you shall never lay hand upon it , '' he cried , exultantly . `` It is my treasure ; and if I ca n't have the loot I 'll take darned good care that no one else does . I tell you that no living man has any right to it , unless it is three men who are in the Andaman convict-barracks and myself . I know now that I can not have the use of it , and I know that they can not . I have acted all through for them as much as for myself . It 's been the sign of four with us always . Well I know that they would have had me do just what I have done , and throw the treasure into the Thames rather than let it go to kith or kin of Sholto or of Morstan . It was not to make them rich that we did for Achmet . You 'll find the treasure where the key is , and where little Tonga is . When I saw that your launch must catch us , I put the loot away in a safe place . There are no rupees for you this journey . `` `` You are deceiving us , Small , '' said Athelney Jones , sternly . `` If you had wished to throw the treasure into the Thames it would have been easier for you to have thrown box and all . `` `` Easier for me to throw , and easier for you to recover , '' he answered , with a shrewd , sidelong look . `` The man that was clever enough to hunt me down is clever enough to pick an iron box from the bottom of a river . Now that they are scattered over five miles or so , it may be a harder job . It went to my heart to do it , though . I
