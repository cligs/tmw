trees in such a manner that no one could possibly pass without seeing it . On the white surface of this board was printed in big , black letters the following hospitable inscription : GENERAL AND MRS. HEATHERSTONE HAVE NO WISH TO INCREASE THE CIRCLE OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE.We all sat gazing at this announcement for some moments in silent astonishment . Then Esther and I , tickled by the absurdity of the thing , burst out laughing , but my father pulled the ponies ' heads round , and drove home with compressed lips and the cloud of much wrath upon his brow . I have never seen the good man so thoroughly moved , and I am convinced that his anger did not arise from any petty feeling of injured vanity upon his own part , but from the thought that a slight had been offered to the Laird of Branksome , whose dignity he represented.If I had any personal soreness on account of this family snub , it was a very passing emotion , and one which was soon effaced from my mind.It chanced that on the very next day after the episode I had occasion to pass that way , and stopped to have another look at the obnoxious placard . I was standing staring at it and wondering what could have induced our neighbours to take such an outrageous step , when I became suddenly aware of a sweet , girlish face which peeped out at me from between the bars of the gate , and of a white hand which eagerly beckoned me to approach . As I advanced to her I saw that it was the same young lady whom I had seen in the carriage. '' Mr . West , '' she said , in a quick whisper , glancing from side to side as she spoke in a nervous , hasty manner , `` I wish to apologise to you for the indignity to which you and your family were subjected yesterday . My brother was in the avenue and saw it all , but he is powerless to interfere . I assure you , Mr. West , that if that hateful thing , '' pointing up at the placard , `` has given you any annoyance , it has given my brother and myself far more . `` `` Why , Miss Heatherstone , '' said I , putting the matter off with a laugh , `` Britain is a free country , and if a man chooses to warn off visitors from his premises there is no reason why he should not . `` `` It is nothing less than brutal , '' she broke out , with a petulant stamp of the foot . `` To think that your sister , too , should have such an unprovoked insult offered to her ! I am ready to sink with shame at the very thought . `` `` Pray do not give yourself one moment 's uneasiness upon the subject , '' said I earnestly , for I was grieved at her evident distress . `` I am sure that your father has some reason unknown to us for taking this step . `` `` Heaven knows he has ! '' she answered , with ineffable sadness in her voice , `` and yet I think it would be more manly to face a danger than to fly from it . However , he knows best , and it is impossible for us to judge . But who is this ? '' she exclaimed , anxiously , peering up the dark avenue . `` Oh , it is my brother Mordaunt . Mordaunt , '' she said , as the young man approached us , `` I have been apologising to Mr. West for what happened yesterday , in your name as well as my own . `` `` I am very , very glad to have the opportunity of doing it in person , '' said he courteously . `` I only wish that I could see your sister and your father as well as yourself , to tell them how sorry I am . I think you had better run up to the house , little one , for it 's getting near tiffin-time . No -- -do n't you go Mr. West . I want to have a word with you . `` Miss Heatherstone waved her hand to me with a bright smile , and tripped up the avenue , while her brother unbolted the gate , and , passing through , closed it again , locking it upon the outside . `` I 'll have a stroll down the road with you , if you have no objection . Have a manilla . '' He drew a couple of cheroots from his pocket and handed one to me . `` You 'll find they are not bad , '' he said . `` I became a connoisseur in tobacco when I was in India . I hope I am not interfering with your business in coming along with you ? `` `` Not at all , '' I answered , `` I am very glad to have your company . `` `` I 'll tell you a secret , '' said my companion . `` This is the first time that I have been outside the grounds since we have been down here . `` `` And your sister ? `` `` She has never been out , either , '' he answered . `` I have given the governor the slip to-day , but he would n't half like it if he knew . It 's a whim of his that we should keep ourselves entirely to ourselves . At least , some people would call it a whim , for my own part I have reason to believe that he has solid grounds for all that he does -- -though perhaps in this matter he may be a little too exacting . `` `` You must surely find it very lonely , '' said I . `` Could n't you manage to slip down at times and have a smoke with me ? That house over yonder is Branksome . `` `` Indeed , you are very kind , '' he answered , with sparkling eyes . `` I should dearly like to run over now and again . With the exception of Israel Stakes , our old coachman and gardener , I have not a soul that I can speak to . `` `` And your sister -- -she must feel it even more , '' said I , thinking in my heart that my new acquaintance made rather too much of his own troubles and too little of those of his companion . `` Yes ; poor Gabriel feels it , no doubt , '' he answered carelessly , `` but it 's a more unnatural thing for a young man of my age to be cooped up in this way than for a woman . Look at me , now . I am three-and-twenty next March , and yet I have never been to a university , nor to a school for that matter . I am as complete an ignoramus as any of these clodhoppers . It seems strange to you , no doubt , and yet it is so . Now , do n't you think I deserve a better fate ? `` He stopped as he spoke , and faced round to me , throwing his palms forward in appeal.As I looked at him , with the sun shining upon his face , he certainly did seem a strange bird to be cooped up in such a cage . Tall and muscular , with a keen , dark face , and sharp , finely cut features , he might have stepped out of a canvas of Murillo or Velasquez . There were latent energy and power in his firm-set mouth , his square eyebrows , and the whole pose of his elastic , well-knit figure . `` There is the learning to be got from books and the learning to be got from experience , '' said I sententiously . `` If you have less of your share of the one , perhaps you have more of the other . I can not believe you have spent all your life in mere idleness and pleasure. '' '' Pleasure ! '' he cried . `` Pleasure ! Look at this ! '' He pulled off his hat , and I saw that his black hair was all decked and dashed with streaks of grey . `` Do you imagine that this came from pleasure ? '' he asked , with a bitter laugh . `` You must have had some great shock , '' I said , astonished at the sight , `` some terrible illness in your youth . Or perhaps it arises from a more chronic cause -- -a constant gnawing anxiety . I have known men as young as you whose hair was as grey . `` `` Poor brutes ! '' he muttered . `` I pity them . `` `` If you can manage to slip down to Branksome at times , '' I said , `` perhaps you could bring Miss Heatherstone with you . I know that my father and my sister would be delighted to see her , and a change , if only for an hour or two , might do her good . `` `` It would be rather hard for us both to get away together , '' he answered . `` However , if I see a chance I shall bring her down . It might be managed some afternoon perhaps , for the old man indulges in a siesta occasionally . `` We had reached the head of the winding lane which branches off from the high road and leads to the laird 's house , so my companion pulled up . `` I must go back , '' he said abruptly , `` or they will miss me . It 's very kind of you , West , to take this interest in us . I am very grateful to you , and so will Gabriel be when she hears of your kind invitation . It 's a real heaping of coals of fire after that infernal placard of my father 's . `` He shook my hand and set off down the road , but he came running after me presently , calling me to stop . `` I was just thinking , '' he said , `` that you must consider us a great mystery up there at Cloomber . I dare say you have come to look upon it as a private lunatic asylum , and I ca n't blame you . If you are interested in the matter , I feel it is unfriendly upon my part not to satisfy your curiosity , but I have promised my father to be silent about it . And indeed if I were to tell you all that I know you might not be very much the wiser after all . I would have you understand this , however -- -that my father is as sane as you or I , and that he has very good reasons for living the life which he does . I may add that his wish to remain secluded does not arise from any unworthy or dishonourable motives , but merely from the instinct of self-preservation . `` `` He is in danger , then ? '' I ejaculated . `` Yes ; he is in constant danger . `` `` But why does he not apply to the magistrates for protection ? '' I asked .
