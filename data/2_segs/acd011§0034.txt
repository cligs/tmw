know enough ; but I will see that their murderers are hanged . I gave Chester Wilcox warning , so that when I blew his house in he and his folk were in hiding . There was many a crime that I could not stop ; but if you look back and think how often your man came home the other road , or was down in town when you went for him , or stayed indoors when you thought he would come out , you 'll see my work . `` `` You blasted traitor ! '' hissed McGinty through his closed teeth . `` Ay , John McGinty , you may call me that if it eases your smart . You and your like have been the enemy of God and man in these parts . It took a man to get between you and the poor devils of men and women that you held under your grip . There was just one way of doing it , and I did it . You call me a traitor ; but I guess there 's many a thousand will call me a deliverer that went down into hell to save them . I 've had three months of it . I would n't have three such months again if they let me loose in the treasury at Washington for it . I had to stay till I had it all , every man and every secret right here in this hand . I 'd have waited a little longer if it had n't come to my knowledge that my secret was coming out . A letter had come into the town that would have set you wise to it all . Then I had to act and act quickly . `` I 've nothing more to say to you , except that when my time comes I 'll die the easier when I think of the work I have done in this valley . Now , Marvin , I 'll keep you no more . Take them in and get it over . `` There is little more to tell . Scanlan had been given a sealed note to be left at the address of Miss Ettie Shafter , a mission which he had accepted with a wink and a knowing smile . In the early hours of the morning a beautiful woman and a much muffled man boarded a special train which had been sent by the railroad company , and made a swift , unbroken journey out of the land of danger . It was the last time that ever either Ettie or her lover set foot in the Valley of Fear . Ten days later they were married in Chicago , with old Jacob Shafter as witness of the wedding.The trial of the Scowrers was held far from the place where their adherents might have terrified the guardians of the law . In vain they struggled . In vain the money of the lodge -- -money squeezed by blackmail out of the whole countryside -- -was spent like water in the attempt to save them . That cold , clear , unimpassioned statement from one who knew every detail of their lives , their organization , and their crimes was unshaken by all the wiles of their defenders . At last after so many years they were broken and scattered . The cloud was lifted forever from the valley.McGinty met his fate upon the scaffold , cringing and whining when the last hour came . Eight of his chief followers shared his fate . Fifty-odd had various degrees of imprisonment . The work of Birdy Edwards was complete.And yet , as he had guessed , the game was not over yet . There was another hand to be played , and yet another and another . Ted Baldwin , for one , had escaped the scaffold ; so had the Willabys ; so had several others of the fiercest spirits of the gang . For ten years they were out of the world , and then came a day when they were free once more -- -a day which Edwards , who knew his men , was very sure would be an end of his life of peace . They had sworn an oath on all that they thought holy to have his blood as a vengeance for their comrades . And well they strove to keep their vow ! From Chicago he was chased , after two attempts so near success that it was sure that the third would get him . From Chicago he went under a changed name to California , and it was there that the light went for a time out of his life when Ettie Edwards died . Once again he was nearly killed , and once again under the name of Douglas he worked in a lonely canyon , where with an English partner named Barker he amassed a fortune . At last there came a warning to him that the bloodhounds were on his track once more , and he cleared -- -only just in time -- -for England . And thence came the John Douglas who for a second time married a worthy mate , and lived for five years as a Sussex county gentleman , a life which ended with the strange happenings of which we have heard . The police trial had passed , in which the case of John Douglas was referred to a higher court . So had the Quarter Sessions , at which he was acquitted as having acted in self-defense . `` Get him out of England at any cost , '' wrote Holmes to the wife . `` There are forces here which may be more dangerous than those he has escaped . There is no safety for your husband in England . `` Two months had gone by , and the case had to some extent passed from our minds . Then one morning there came an enigmatic note slipped into our letter box . `` Dear me , Mr. Holmes . Dear me ! '' said this singular epistle . There was neither superscription nor signature . I laughed at the quaint message ; but Holmes showed unwonted seriousness . `` Deviltry , Watson ! '' he remarked , and sat long with a clouded brow.Late last night Mrs. Hudson , our landlady , brought up a message that a gentleman wished to see Mr. Holmes , and that the matter was of the utmost importance . Close at the heels of his messenger came Cecil Barker , our friend of the moated Manor House . His face was drawn and haggard . `` I 've had bad news -- -terrible news , Mr. Holmes , '' said he . `` I feared as much , '' said Holmes . `` You have not had a cable , have you ? `` `` I have had a note from someone who has . `` `` It 's poor Douglas . They tell me his name is Edwards ; but he will always be Jack Douglas of Benito Canyon to me . I told you that they started together for South Africa in the Palmyra three weeks ago. '' '' Exactly . `` `` The ship reached Cape Town last night . I received this cable from Mrs. Douglas this morning : '' 'Jack has been lost overboard in gale off St. Helena . No one knows how accident occurred . ' '' 'IVY DOUGLAS. ' '' '' Ha ! It came like that , did it ? '' said Holmes thoughtfully . `` Well , I 've no doubt it was well stage-managed . `` `` You mean that you think there was no accident ? `` `` None in the world . `` `` He was murdered ? '' '' Surely ! `` `` So I think also . These infernal Scowrers , this cursed vindictive nest of criminals -- - '' '' No , no , my good sir , '' said Holmes . `` There is a master hand here . It is no case of sawed-off shotguns and clumsy six-shooters . You can tell an old master by the sweep of his brush . I can tell a Moriarty when I see one . This crime is from London , not from America . `` `` But for what motive ? `` `` Because it is done by a man who can not afford to fail , one whose whole unique position depends upon the fact that all he does must succeed . A great brain and a huge organization have been turned to the extinction of one man . It is crushing the nut with the triphammer -- -an absurd extravagance of energy -- -but the nut is very effectually crushed all the same . `` `` How came this man to have anything to do with it ? `` `` I can only say that the first word that ever came to us of the business was from one of his lieutenants . These Americans were well advised . Having an English job to do , they took into partnership , as any foreign criminal could do , this great consultant in crime . From that moment their man was doomed . At first he would content himself by using his machinery in order to find their victim . Then he would indicate how the matter might be treated . Finally , when he read in the reports of the failure of this agent , he would step in himself with a master touch . You heard me warn this man at Birlstone Manor House that the coming danger was greater than the past . Was I right ? `` Barker beat his head with his clenched fist in his impotent anger . `` Do not tell me that we have to sit down under this ? Do you say that no one can ever get level with this king devil ? `` `` No , I do n't say that , '' said Holmes , and his eyes seemed to be looking far into the future . `` I do n't say that he ca n't be beat . But you must give me time -- -you must give me time ! `` We all sat in silence for some minutes while those fateful eyes still strained to pierce the veil .
