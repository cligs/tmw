the quiet southland parts . Alleyne had read of such folk , but had never seen one before , and could scarce take his eyes from the fellow 's broad pouting lip and shining teeth . Even as he gazed , however , the two came writhing out from among the heather , and came down towards him with such a guilty , slinking carriage , that the clerk felt that there was no good in them , and hastened onwards upon his way.He had not gained the crown of the slope , when he heard a sudden scuffle behind him and a feeble voice bleating for help . Looking round , there was the old dame down upon the roadway , with her red whimple flying on the breeze , while the two rogues , black and white , stooped over her , wresting away from her the penny and such other poor trifles as were worth the taking . At the sight of her thin limbs struggling in weak resistance , such a glow of fierce anger passed over Alleyne as set his head in a whirl . Dropping his scrip , he bounded over the stream once more , and made for the two villains , with his staff whirled over his shoulder and his gray eyes blazing with fury.The robbers , however , were not disposed to leave their victim until they had worked their wicked will upon her . The black man , with the woman 's crimson scarf tied round his swarthy head , stood forward in the centre of the path , with a long dull-colored knife in his hand , while the other , waving a ragged cudgel , cursed at Alleyne and dared him to come on . His blood was fairly aflame , however , and he needed no such challenge . Dashing at the black man , he smote at him with such good will that the other let his knife tinkle into the roadway , and hopped howling to a safer distance . The second rogue , however , made of sterner stuff , rushed in upon the clerk , and clipped him round the waist with a grip like a bear , shouting the while to his comrade to come round and stab him in the back . At this the negro took heart of grace , and picking up his dagger again he came stealing with prowling step and murderous eye , while the two swayed backwards and forwards , staggering this way and that . In the very midst of the scuffle , however , whilst Alleyne braced himself to feel the cold blade between his shoulders , there came a sudden scurry of hoofs , and the black man yelled with terror and ran for his life through the heather . The man with the birth-mark , too , struggled to break away , and Alleyne heard his teeth chatter and felt his limbs grow limp to his hand . At this sign of coming aid the clerk held on the tighter , and at last was able to pin his man down and glanced behind him to see where all the noise was coming from.Down the slanting road there was riding a big , burly man , clad in a tunic of purple velvet and driving a great black horse as hard as it could gallop . He leaned well over its neck as he rode , and made a heaving with his shoulders at every bound as though he were lifting the steed instead of it carrying him . In the rapid glance Alleyne saw that he had white doeskin gloves , a curling white feather in his flat velvet cap , and a broad gold , embroidered baldric across his bosom . Behind him rode six others , two and two , clad in sober brown jerkins , with the long yellow staves of their bows thrusting out from behind their right shoulders . Down the hill they thundered , over the brook and up to the scene of the contest . `` Here is one ! '' said the leader , springing down from his reeking horse , and seizing the white rogue by the edge of his jerkin . `` This is one of them . I know him by that devil 's touch upon his brow . Where are your cords , Peterkin ? So ! Bind him hand and foot . His last hour has come . And you , young man , who may you be ? `` `` I am a clerk , sir , travelling from Beaulieu . `` `` A clerk ! '' cried the other . `` Art from Oxenford or from Cambridge ? Hast thou a letter from the chancellor of thy college giving thee a permit to beg ? Let me see thy letter . '' He had a stern , square face , with bushy side whiskers and a very questioning eye . `` I am from Beaulieu Abbey , and I have no need to beg , '' said Alleyne , who was all of a tremble now that the ruffle was over . `` The better for thee , '' the other answered . `` Dost know who I am ? `` `` No , sir , I do not . `` `` I am the law ! '' -- -nodding his head solemnly . `` I am the law of England and the mouthpiece of his most gracious and royal majesty , Edward the Third . `` Alleyne louted low to the King 's representative . `` Truly you came in good time , honored sir , '' said he . `` A moment later and they would have slain me . `` `` But there should be another one , '' cried the man in the purple coat . `` There should be a black man . A shipman with St. Anthony 's fire , and a black man who had served him as cook -- -those are the pair that we are in chase of . `` `` The black man fled over to that side , '' said Alleyne , pointing towards the barrow . `` He could not have gone far , sir bailiff , '' cried one of the archers , unslinging his bow . `` He is in hiding somewhere , for he knew well , black paynim as he is , that our horses ' four legs could outstrip his two . `` `` Then we shall have him , '' said the other . `` It shall never be said , whilst I am bailiff of Southampton , that any waster , riever , draw-latch or murtherer came scathless away from me and my posse . Leave that rogue lying . Now stretch out in line , my merry ones , with arrow on string , and I shall show you such sport as only the King can give . You on the left , Howett , and Thomas of Redbridge upon the right . So ! Beat high and low among the heather , and a pot of wine to the lucky marksman . `` As it chanced , however , the searchers had not far to seek . The negro had burrowed down into his hiding-place upon the barrow , where he might have lain snug enough , had it not been for the red gear upon his head . As he raised himself to look over the bracken at his enemies , the staring color caught the eye of the bailiff , who broke into a long screeching whoop and spurred forward sword in hand . Seeing himself discovered , the man rushed out from his hiding-place , and bounded at the top of his speed down the line of archers , keeping a good hundred paces to the front of them . The two who were on either side of Alleyne bent their bows as calmly as though they were shooting at the popinjay at the village fair . `` Seven yards windage , Hal , '' said one , whose hair was streaked with gray . `` Five , '' replied the other , letting loose his string . Alleyne gave a gulp in his throat , for the yellow streak seemed to pass through the man ; but he still ran forward . `` Seven , you jack-fool , '' growled the first speaker , and his bow twanged like a harp-string . The black man sprang high up into the air , and shot out both his arms and his legs , coming down all a-sprawl among the heather . `` Right under the blade bone ! '' quoth the archer , sauntering forward for his arrow . `` The old hound is the best when all is said , '' quoth the bailiff of Southampton , as they made back for the roadway . `` That means a quart of the best malmsey in Southampton this very night , Matthew Atwood . Art sure that he is dead ? `` `` Dead as Pontius Pilate , worshipful sir . `` `` It is well . Now , as to the other knave . There are trees and to spare over yonder , but we have scarce leisure to make for them . Draw thy sword , Thomas of Redbridge , and hew me his head from his shoulders . `` `` A boon , gracious sir , a boon ! '' cried the condemned man . `` What then ? '' asked the bailiff . `` I will confess to my crime . It was indeed I and the black cook , both from the ship 'La Rose de Gloire , ' of Southampton , who did set upon the Flanders merchant and rob him of his spicery and his mercery , for which , as we well know , you hold a warrant against us . `` `` There is little merit in this confession , '' quoth the bailiff sternly . `` Thou hast done evil within my bailiwick , and must die . `` `` But , sir , '' urged Alleyne , who was white to the lips at these bloody doings , `` he hath not yet come to trial . `` `` Young clerk , '' said the bailiff , `` you speak of that of which you know nothing . It is true that he hath not come to trial , but the trial hath come to him . He hath fled the law and is beyond its pale . Touch not that which is no concern of thine . But what is this boon , rogue , which you would crave ? `` `` I have in my shoe , most worshipful sir , a strip of wood which belonged once to the bark wherein the blessed Paul was dashed up against the island of Melita . I bought it for two rose nobles from a shipman who came from the Levant . The boon I crave is that you will place it in my hands and let me die still grasping it . In this manner , not only shall my own eternal salvation be secured , but thine also , for I shall never cease to intercede for thee . `` At the command of the bailiff they plucked off the fellow 's shoe , and there sure enough at the side of the instep , wrapped in a piece of fine sendall , lay a long , dark splinter of wood . The archers doffed caps at the sight of it , and the bailiff crossed himself devoutly as he handed it to the robber . `` If it should chance , '' he said , `` that through
