both in the banquet-hall anon . Meanwhile you will attend upon us with our train . '' He bowed , and Chandos , plucking Sir Oliver by the sleeve , led them both away to the back of the press of courtiers . `` Why , little coz , '' he whispered , `` you are very eager to have your neck in a noose . By my soul ! had you asked as much from our new ally Don Pedro , he had not baulked you . Between friends , there is overmuch of the hangman in him , and too little of the prince . But indeed this White Company is a rough band , and may take some handling ere you find yourself safe in your captaincy . `` `` I doubt not , with the help of St. Paul , that I shall bring them to some order , '' Sir Nigel answered . `` But there are many faces here which are new to me , though others have been before me since first I waited upon my dear master , Sir Walter . I pray you to tell me , Sir John , who are these priests upon the dais ? `` `` The one is the Archbishop of Bordeaux , Nigel , and the other the Bishop of Agen . `` `` And the dark knight with gray-streaked beard ? By my troth , he seems to be a man of much wisdom and valor . `` `` He is Sir William Felton , who , with my unworthy self , is the chief counsellor of the prince , he being high steward and I the seneschal of Aquitaine . `` `` And the knights upon the right , beside Don Pedro ? `` `` They are cavaliers of Spain who have followed him in his exile . The one at his elbow is Fernando de Castro , who is as brave and true a man as heart could wish . In front to the right are the Gascon lords . You may well tell them by their clouded brows , for there hath been some ill-will of late betwixt the prince and them . The tall and burly man is the Captal de Buch , whom I doubt not that you know , for a braver knight never laid lance in rest . That heavy-faced cavalier who plucks his skirts and whispers in his ear is Lord Oliver de Clisson , known also as the butcher . He it is who stirs up strife , and forever blows the dying embers into flame . The man with the mole upon his cheek is the Lord Pommers , and his two brothers stand behind him , with the Lord Lesparre , Lord de Rosem , Lord de Mucident , Sir Perducas d'Albret , the Souldich de la Trane , and others . Further back are knights from Quercy , Limousin , Saintonge , Poitou , and Aquitaine , with the valiant Sir Guiscard d'Angle . That is he in the rose-colored doublet with the ermine . `` `` And the knights upon this side ? `` `` They are all Englishmen , some of the household and others who like yourself , are captains of companies . There is Lord Neville , Sir Stephen Cossington , and Sir Matthew Gourney , with Sir Walter Huet , Sir Thomas Banaster , and Sir Thomas Felton , who is the brother of the high steward . Mark well the man with the high nose and flaxen beard who hath placed his hand upon the shoulder of the dark hard-faced cavalier in the rust-stained jupon . `` `` Aye , by St . Paul ! '' observed Sir Nigel , `` they both bear the print of their armor upon their cotes-hardies . Methinks they are men who breathe freer in a camp than a court . `` `` There are many of us who do that , Nigel , '' said Chandos , `` and the head of the court is , I dare warrant , among them . But of these two men the one is Sir Hugh Calverley , and the other is Sir Robert Knolles . `` Sir Nigel and Sir Oliver craned their necks to have the clearer view of these famous warriors , the one a chosen leader of free companies , the other a man who by his fierce valor and energy had raised himself from the lowest ranks until he was second only to Chandos himself in the esteem of the army . `` He hath no light hand in war , hath Sir Robert , '' said Chandos . `` If he passes through a country you may tell it for some years to come . I have heard that in the north it is still the use to call a house which hath but the two gable ends left , without walls or roof , a Knolles ' mitre . `` `` I have often heard of him , '' said Nigel , `` and I have hoped to be so far honored as to run a course with him . But hark , Sir John , what is amiss with the prince ? `` Whilst Chandos had been conversing with the two knights a continuous stream of suitors had been ushered in , adventurers seeking to sell their swords and merchants clamoring over some grievance , a ship detained for the carriage of troops , or a tun of sweet wine which had the bottom knocked out by a troop of thirsty archers . A few words from the prince disposed of each case , and , if the applicant liked not the judgment , a quick glance from the prince 's dark eyes sent him to the door with the grievance all gone out of him . The younger ruler had sat listlessly upon his stool with the two puppet monarchs enthroned behind him , but of a sudden a dark shadow passed over his face , and he sprang to his feet in one of those gusts of passion which were the single blot upon his noble and generous character . `` How now , Don Martin de la Carra ? '' he cried . `` How now , sirrah ? What message do you bring to us from our brother of Navarre ? `` The new-comer to whom this abrupt query had been addressed was a tall and exceedingly handsome cavalier who had just been ushered into the apartment . His swarthy cheek and raven black hair spoke of the fiery south , and he wore his long black cloak swathed across his chest and over his shoulders in a graceful sweeping fashion , which was neither English nor French . With stately steps and many profound bows , he advanced to the foot of the dais before replying to the prince 's question . `` My powerful and illustrious master , '' he began , `` Charles , King of Navarre , Earl of Evreux , Count of Champagne , who also writeth himself Overlord of Bearn , hereby sends his love and greetings to his dear cousin Edward , the Prince of Wales , Governor of Aquitaine , Grand Commander of -- -- -- '' '' Tush ! tush ! Don Martin ! '' interrupted the prince , who had been beating the ground with his foot impatiently during this stately preamble . `` We already know our cousin 's titles and style , and , certes , we know our own . To the point , man , and at once . Are the passes open to us , or does your master go back from his word pledged to me at Libourne no later than last Michaelmas ? `` `` It would ill become my gracious master , sire , to go back from promise given . He does but ask some delay and certain conditions and hostages -- -- -- '' '' Conditions ! Hostages ! Is he speaking to the Prince of England , or is it to the bourgeois provost of some half-captured town ! Conditions , quotha ? He may find much to mend in his own condition ere long . The passes are , then , closed to us ? `` `` Nay , sire -- -- -- '' '' They are open , then ? `` `` Nay , sire , if you would but -- -- -- '' '' Enough , enough , Don Martin , '' cried the prince . `` It is a sorry sight to see so true a knight pleading in so false a cause . We know the doings of our cousin Charles . We know that while with the right hand he takes our fifty thousand crowns for the holding of the passes open , he hath his left outstretched to Henry of Trastamare , or to the King of France , all ready to take as many more for the keeping them closed . I know our good Charles , and , by my blessed name-saint the Confessor , he shall learn that I know him . He sets his kingdom up to the best bidder , like some scullion farrier selling a glandered horse . He is -- -- -- '' '' My lord , '' cried Don Martin , `` I can not stand there to hear such words of my master . Did they come from other lips , I should know better how to answer them . `` Don Pedro frowned and curled his lip , but the prince smiled and nodded his approbation . `` Your bearing and your words , Don Martin , are such I should have looked for in you , '' he remarked . `` You will tell the king , your master , that he hath been paid his price and that if he holds to his promise he hath my word for it that no scath shall come to his people , nor to their houses or gear . If , however , we have not his leave , I shall come close at the heels of this message without his leave , and bearing a key with me which shall open all that he may close . '' He stooped and whispered to Sir Robert Knolles and Sir Huge Calverley , who smiled as men well pleased , and hastened from the room . `` Our cousin Charles has had experience of our friendship , '' the prince continued , `` and now , by the Saints ! he shall feel a touch of our displeasure . I send now a message to our cousin Charles which his whole kingdom may read . Let him take heed lest worse befall him . Where is my Lord Chandos ? Ha , Sir John , I commend this worthy knight to your care . You will see that he hath refection , and such a purse of gold as may defray his charges , for indeed it is great honor to any court to have within it so noble and gentle a cavalier . How say you , sire ? '' he asked , turning to the Spanish refugee , while the herald of Navarre was conducted from the chamber by the old warrior . `` It is not our custom in Spain to reward pertness in a messenger , '' Don Pedro answered , patting the head of his greyhound . `` Yet we have all heard the lengths to which your royal generosity runs . `` `` In sooth , yes , '' cried the King of Majorca . `` Who should know it better than we ? '' said Don Pedro bitterly , `` since we have had to fly to
