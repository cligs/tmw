men . None knew who belonged to this ruthless society . The names of the participators in the deeds of blood and violence done under the name of religion were kept profoundly secret . The very friend to whom you communicated your misgivings as to the Prophet and his mission , might be one of those who would come forth at night with fire and sword to exact a terrible reparation . Hence every man feared his neighbour , and none spoke of the things which were nearest his heart.One fine morning , John Ferrier was about to set out to his wheatfields , when he heard the click of the latch , and , looking through the window , saw a stout , sandy-haired , middle-aged man coming up the pathway . His heart leapt to his mouth , for this was none other than the great Brigham Young himself . Full of trepidation -- -for he knew that such a visit boded him little good -- -Ferrier ran to the door to greet the Mormon chief . The latter , however , received his salutations coldly , and followed him with a stern face into the sitting-room . `` Brother Ferrier , '' he said , taking a seat , and eyeing the farmer keenly from under his light-coloured eyelashes , `` the true believers have been good friends to you . We picked you up when you were starving in the desert , we shared our food with you , led you safe to the Chosen Valley , gave you a goodly share of land , and allowed you to wax rich under our protection . Is not this so ? `` `` It is so , '' answered John Ferrier . `` In return for all this we asked but one condition : that was , that you should embrace the true faith , and conform in every way to its usages . This you promised to do , and this , if common report says truly , you have neglected . `` `` And how have I neglected it ? '' asked Ferrier , throwing out his hands in expostulation . `` Have I not given to the common fund ? Have I not attended at the Temple ? Have I not -- -- -- ? `` `` Where are your wives ? '' asked Young , looking round him . `` Call them in , that I may greet them . `` `` It is true that I have not married , '' Ferrier answered . `` But women were few , and there were many who had better claims than I. I was not a lonely man : I had my daughter to attend to my wants . `` `` It is of that daughter that I would speak to you , '' said the leader of the Mormons . `` She has grown to be the flower of Utah , and has found favour in the eyes of many who are high in the land . `` John Ferrier groaned internally . `` There are stories of her which I would fain disbelieve -- -stories that she is sealed to some Gentile . This must be the gossip of idle tongues . What is the thirteenth rule in the code of the sainted Joseph Smith ? 'Let every maiden of the true faith marry one of the elect ; for if she wed a Gentile , she commits a grievous sin . ' This being so , it is impossible that you , who profess the holy creed , should suffer your daughter to violate it . `` John Ferrier made no answer , but he played nervously with his riding-whip . `` Upon this one point your whole faith shall be tested -- -so it has been decided in the Sacred Council of Four . The girl is young , and we would not have her wed grey hairs , neither would we deprive her of all choice . We Elders have many heifers , 29 but our children must also be provided . Stangerson has a son , and Drebber has a son , and either of them would gladly welcome your daughter to their house . Let her choose between them . They are young and rich , and of the true faith . What say you to that ? `` Ferrier remained silent for some little time with his brows knitted . `` You will give us time , '' he said at last . `` My daughter is very young -- -she is scarce of an age to marry . `` `` She shall have a month to choose , '' said Young , rising from his seat . `` At the end of that time she shall give her answer . `` He was passing through the door , when he turned , with flushed face and flashing eyes . `` It were better for you , John Ferrier , '' he thundered , `` that you and she were now lying blanched skeletons upon the Sierra Blanco , than that you should put your weak wills against the orders of the Holy Four ! `` With a threatening gesture of his hand , he turned from the door , and Ferrier heard his heavy step scrunching along the shingly path.He was still sitting with his elbows upon his knees , considering how he should broach the matter to his daughter when a soft hand was laid upon his , and looking up , he saw her standing beside him . One glance at her pale , frightened face showed him that she had heard what had passed . `` I could not help it , '' she said , in answer to his look . `` His voice rang through the house . Oh , father , father , what shall we do ? `` `` Do n't you scare yourself , '' he answered , drawing her to him , and passing his broad , rough hand caressingly over her chestnut hair . `` We 'll fix it up somehow or another . You do n't find your fancy kind o ' lessening for this chap , do you ? `` A sob and a squeeze of his hand was her only answer . `` No ; of course not . I should n't care to hear you say you did . He 's a likely lad , and he 's a Christian , which is more than these folk here , in spite o ' all their praying and preaching . There 's a party starting for Nevada to-morrow , and I 'll manage to send him a message letting him know the hole we are in . If I know anything o ' that young man , he 'll be back here with a speed that would whip electro-telegraphs . `` Lucy laughed through her tears at her father 's description . `` When he comes , he will advise us for the best . But it is for you that I am frightened , dear . One hears -- -one hears such dreadful stories about those who oppose the Prophet : something terrible always happens to them . `` `` But we have n't opposed him yet , '' her father answered . `` It will be time to look out for squalls when we do . We have a clear month before us ; at the end of that , I guess we had best shin out of Utah . `` `` Leave Utah ! `` `` That 's about the size of it . `` `` But the farm ? `` `` We will raise as much as we can in money , and let the rest go . To tell the truth , Lucy , it is n't the first time I have thought of doing it . I do n't care about knuckling under to any man , as these folk do to their darned prophet . I 'm a free-born American , and it 's all new to me . Guess I 'm too old to learn . If he comes browsing about this farm , he might chance to run up against a charge of buckshot travelling in the opposite direction . `` `` But they wo n't let us leave , '' his daughter objected . `` Wait till Jefferson comes , and we 'll soon manage that . In the meantime , do n't you fret yourself , my dearie , and do n't get your eyes swelled up , else he 'll be walking into me when he sees you . There 's nothing to be afeared about , and there 's no danger at all . `` John Ferrier uttered these consoling remarks in a very confident tone , but she could not help observing that he paid unusual care to the fastening of the doors that night , and that he carefully cleaned and loaded the rusty old shotgun which hung upon the wall of his bedroom.ON the morning which followed his interview with the Mormon Prophet , John Ferrier went in to Salt Lake City , and having found his acquaintance , who was bound for the Nevada Mountains , he entrusted him with his message to Jefferson Hope . In it he told the young man of the imminent danger which threatened them , and how necessary it was that he should return . Having done thus he felt easier in his mind , and returned home with a lighter heart.As he approached his farm , he was surprised to see a horse hitched to each of the posts of the gate . Still more surprised was he on entering to find two young men in possession of his sitting-room . One , with a long pale face , was leaning back in the rocking-chair , with his feet cocked up upon the stove . The other , a bull-necked youth with coarse bloated features , was standing in front of the window with his hands in his pocket , whistling a popular hymn . Both of them nodded to Ferrier as he entered , and the one in the rocking-chair commenced the conversation . `` Maybe you do n't know us , '' he said . `` This here is the son of Elder Drebber , and I 'm Joseph Stangerson , who travelled with you in the desert when the Lord stretched out His hand and gathered you into the true fold . `` `` As He will all the nations in His own good time , '' said the other in a nasal voice ; `` He grindeth slowly but exceeding small . `` John Ferrier bowed coldly . He had guessed who his visitors were . `` We have come , '' continued Stangerson , `` at the advice of our fathers to solicit the hand of your daughter for whichever of us may seem good to you and to her . As I have but four wives and Brother Drebber here has seven , it appears to me that my claim is the stronger one . `` `` Nay , nay , Brother Stangerson , '' cried the other ; `` the question is not how many wives we have , but how many we can keep . My father has now given over his mills to me , and I am the richer man . `` `` But my prospects are better , '' said the other , warmly . `` When the Lord removes my father , I shall have his tanning yard and his leather factory . Then I am your elder , and am higher in the Church . `` `` It will be for the maiden to decide
