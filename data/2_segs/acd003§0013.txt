so far . `` `` Could we advertise , then , asking for information from wharfingers ? `` `` Worse and worse ! Our men would know that the chase was hot at their heels , and they would be off out of the country . As it is , they are likely enough to leave , but as long as they think they are perfectly safe they will be in no hurry . Jones 's energy will be of use to us there , for his view of the case is sure to push itself into the daily press , and the runaways will think that every one is off on the wrong scent . `` `` What are we to do , then ? '' I asked , as we landed near Millbank Penitentiary . `` Take this hansom , drive home , have some breakfast , and get an hour 's sleep . It is quite on the cards that we may be afoot to-night again . Stop at a telegraph-office , cabby ! We will keep Toby , for he may be of use to us yet . `` We pulled up at the Great Peter Street post-office , and Holmes despatched his wire . `` Whom do you think that is to ? '' he asked , as we resumed our journey . `` I am sure I do n't know . `` `` You remember the Baker Street division of the detective police force whom I employed in the Jefferson Hope case ? `` `` Well , '' said I , laughing . `` This is just the case where they might be invaluable . If they fail , I have other resources ; but I shall try them first . That wire was to my dirty little lieutenant , Wiggins , and I expect that he and his gang will be with us before we have finished our breakfast . `` It was between eight and nine o'clock now , and I was conscious of a strong reaction after the successive excitements of the night . I was limp and weary , befogged in mind and fatigued in body . I had not the professional enthusiasm which carried my companion on , nor could I look at the matter as a mere abstract intellectual problem . As far as the death of Bartholomew Sholto went , I had heard little good of him , and could feel no intense antipathy to his murderers . The treasure , however , was a different matter . That , or part of it , belonged rightfully to Miss Morstan . While there was a chance of recovering it I was ready to devote my life to the one object . True , if I found it it would probably put her forever beyond my reach . Yet it would be a petty and selfish love which would be influenced by such a thought as that . If Holmes could work to find the criminals , I had a tenfold stronger reason to urge me on to find the treasure.A bath at Baker Street and a complete change freshened me up wonderfully . When I came down to our room I found the breakfast laid and Homes pouring out the coffee . `` Here it is , '' said he , laughing , and pointing to an open newspaper . `` The energetic Jones and the ubiquitous reporter have fixed it up between them . But you have had enough of the case . Better have your ham and eggs first . `` I took the paper from him and read the short notice , which was headed `` Mysterious Business at Upper Norwood . `` `` About twelve o'clock last night , '' said the Standard , `` Mr. Bartholomew Sholto , of Pondicherry Lodge , Upper Norwood , was found dead in his room under circumstances which point to foul play . As far as we can learn , no actual traces of violence were found upon Mr. Sholto 's person , but a valuable collection of Indian gems which the deceased gentleman had inherited from his father has been carried off . The discovery was first made by Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson , who had called at the house with Mr. Thaddeus Sholto , brother of the deceased . By a singular piece of good fortune , Mr. Athelney Jones , the well-known member of the detective police force , happened to be at the Norwood Police Station , and was on the ground within half an hour of the first alarm . His trained and experienced faculties were at once directed towards the detection of the criminals , with the gratifying result that the brother , Thaddeus Sholto , has already been arrested , together with the housekeeper , Mrs. Bernstone , an Indian butler named Lal Rao , and a porter , or gatekeeper , named McMurdo . It is quite certain that the thief or thieves were well acquainted with the house , for Mr. Jones 's well-known technical knowledge and his powers of minute observation have enabled him to prove conclusively that the miscreants could not have entered by the door or by the window , but must have made their way across the roof of the building , and so through a trap-door into a room which communicated with that in which the body was found . This fact , which has been very clearly made out , proves conclusively that it was no mere haphazard burglary . The prompt and energetic action of the officers of the law shows the great advantage of the presence on such occasions of a single vigorous and masterful mind . We can not but think that it supplies an argument to those who would wish to see our detectives more decentralized , and so brought into closer and more effective touch with the cases which it is their duty to investigate . `` `` Is n't it gorgeous ! '' said Holmes , grinning over his coffee-cup . `` What do you think of it ? `` `` I think that we have had a close shave ourselves of being arrested for the crime . `` `` So do I. I would n't answer for our safety now , if he should happen to have another of his attacks of energy . `` At this moment there was a loud ring at the bell , and I could hear Mrs. Hudson , our landlady , raising her voice in a wail of expostulation and dismay . `` By heaven , Holmes , '' I said , half rising , `` I believe that they are really after us . `` `` No , it 's not quite so bad as that . It is the unofficial force , -- -the Baker Street irregulars . `` As he spoke , there came a swift pattering of naked feet upon the stairs , a clatter of high voices , and in rushed a dozen dirty and ragged little street-Arabs . There was some show of discipline among them , despite their tumultuous entry , for they instantly drew up in line and stood facing us with expectant faces . One of their number , taller and older than the others , stood forward with an air of lounging superiority which was very funny in such a disreputable little scarecrow . `` Got your message , sir , '' said he , `` and brought 'em on sharp . Three bob and a tanner for tickets . `` `` Here you are , '' said Holmes , producing some silver . `` In future they can report to you , Wiggins , and you to me . I can not have the house invaded in this way . However , it is just as well that you should all hear the instructions . I want to find the whereabouts of a steam launch called the Aurora , owner Mordecai Smith , black with two red streaks , funnel black with a white band . She is down the river somewhere . I want one boy to be at Mordecai Smith 's landing-stage opposite Millbank to say if the boat comes back . You must divide it out among yourselves , and do both banks thoroughly . Let me know the moment you have news . Is that all clear ? `` `` Yes , guv'nor , '' said Wiggins . `` The old scale of pay , and a guinea to the boy who finds the boat . Here 's a day in advance . Now off you go ! '' He handed them a shilling each , and away they buzzed down the stairs , and I saw them a moment later streaming down the street . `` If the launch is above water they will find her , '' said Holmes , as he rose from the table and lit his pipe . `` They can go everywhere , see everything , overhear every one . I expect to hear before evening that they have spotted her . In the mean while , we can do nothing but await results . We can not pick up the broken trail until we find either the Aurora or Mr. Mordecai Smith . `` `` Toby could eat these scraps , I dare say . Are you going to bed , Holmes ? `` `` No : I am not tired . I have a curious constitution . I never remember feeling tired by work , though idleness exhausts me completely . I am going to smoke and to think over this queer business to which my fair client has introduced us . If ever man had an easy task , this of ours ought to be . Wooden-legged men are not so common , but the other man must , I should think , be absolutely unique . `` `` That other man again ! `` `` I have no wish to make a mystery of him , -- -to you , anyway . But you must have formed your own opinion . Now , do consider the data . Diminutive footmarks , toes never fettered by boots , naked feet , stone-headed wooden mace , great agility , small poisoned darts . What do you make of all this ? `` `` A savage ! '' I exclaimed . `` Perhaps one of those Indians who were the associates of Jonathan Small . `` `` Hardly that , '' said he . `` When first I saw signs of strange weapons I was inclined to think so ; but the remarkable character of the footmarks caused me to reconsider my views . Some of the inhabitants of the Indian Peninsula are small men , but none could have left such marks as that . The Hindoo proper has long and thin feet . The sandal-wearing Mohammedan has the great toe well separated from the others , because the thong is commonly passed between . These little darts , too , could only be shot in one way . They are from a blow-pipe . Now , then , where are we to find our savage ? `` `` South American , '' I hazarded.He stretched his hand up , and took down a bulky volume from the shelf . `` This is the first volume of a gazetteer which is now being published . It may be looked upon as the very latest authority . What have we here ? 'Andaman Islands , situated 340 miles to the north of Sumatra , in the Bay of Bengal . ' Hum ! hum ! What 's all this ? Moist climate , coral reefs , sharks , Port Blair , convict-barracks , Rutland
