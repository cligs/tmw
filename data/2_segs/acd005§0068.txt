far in your very natural anxiety , '' said the seigneur coldly . `` I am not inclined to leave my post so easily ! `` `` Ah , what is it ? Only wood and stone , which can be built again . But to think of the women in the hands of these devils ! Oh , I am going mad ! Come ! Come ! For Christ 's sake come ! '' His face was deadly pale , and he raved with his clenched hands in the air . `` I do not think that they will be caught , '' said Du Lhut , laying his hand soothingly upon his shoulder . `` Do not fear . They had a long start and the women here can paddle as well as the men . Again , the Iroquois canoe was overloaded at the start , and has the wounded men aboard as well now . Besides , these oak canoes of the Mohawks are not as swift as the Algonquin birch barks which we use . In any case it is impossible to follow , for we have no boat . `` `` There is one lying there . `` `` Ah , it will but hold a single man . It is that in which the friar came . `` `` Then I am going in that ! My place is with Adele ! '' He flung open the door , rushed out , and was about to push off the frail skiff , when some one sprang past him , and with a blow from a hatchet stove in the side of the boat . `` It is my boat , '' said the friar , throwing down the axe and folding his arms . `` I can do what I like with it . `` `` You fiend ! You have ruined us ! `` `` I have found you and you shall not escape me again . `` The hot blood flushed to the soldier 's head , and picking up the axe , he took a quick step forward . The light from the open door shone upon the grave , harsh face of the friar , but not a muscle twitched nor a feature changed as he saw the axe whirl up in the hands of a furious man . He only signed himself with the cross , and muttered a Latin prayer under his breath . It was that composure which saved his life . De Catinat hurled down the axe again with a bitter curse , and was turning away from the shattered boat , when in an instant , without a warning , the great door of the manor-house crashed inwards , and a flood of whooping savages burst into the house.What had occurred is easily explained . The watchers in the windows at the front found that it was more than flesh and blood could endure to remain waiting at their posts while the fates of their wives and children were being decided at the back . All was quiet at the stockade , and the Indians appeared to be as absorbed as the Canadians in what was passing upon the river . One by one , therefore , the men on guard had crept away and had assembled at the back to cheer the seaman 's shot and to groan as the remaining canoe sped like a bloodhound down the river in the wake of the fugitives . But the savages had one at their head who was as full of wiles and resource as Du Lhut himself . The Flemish Bastard had watched the house from behind the stockade as a dog watches a rat-hole , and he had instantly discovered that the defenders had left their post . With a score of other warriors he raised a great log from the edge of the forest , and crossing the open space unchallenged , he and his men rushed it against the door with such violence as to crack the bar across and tear the wood from the hinges . The first intimation which the survivors had of the attack was the crash of the door , and the screams of two of the negligent watchmen who had been seized and scalped in the hall . The whole basement floor was in the hands of the Indians , and De Catinat and his enemy the friar were cut off from the foot of the stairs.Fortunately , however , the manor-houses of Canada were built with the one idea of defence against Indians , and even now there were hopes for the defenders . A wooden ladder which could be drawn up in case of need hung down from the upper windows to the ground upon the river-side . De Catinat rushed round to this , followed by the friar . He felt about for the ladder in the darkness . It was gone.Then indeed his heart sank in despair . Where could he fly to ? The boat was destroyed . The stockades lay between him and the forest , and they were in the hands of the Iroquois . Their yells were ringing in his ears . They had not seen him yet , but in a few minutes they must come upon him . Suddenly he heard a voice from somewhere in the darkness above him . `` Give me your gun , lad , '' it said . `` I see the loom of some of the heathen down by the wall . `` `` It is I . It is I , Amos , '' cried De Catinat . `` Down with the ladder or I am a dead man . `` `` Have a care . It may be a ruse , '' said the voice of Du Lhut . `` No , no , I 'll answer for it , '' cried Amos , and an instant later down came the ladder . De Catinat and the friar rushed up it , and they hardly had their feet upon the rungs when a swarm of warriors burst out from the door and poured along the river bank . Two muskets flashed from above , something plopped like a salmon in the water , and next instant the two were among their comrades and the ladder had been drawn up once more.But it was a very small band who now held the last point to which they could retreat . Only nine of them remained , the seigneur , Du Lhut , the two Americans , the friar , De Catinat , Theuriet the major-domo , and two of thecensitaires . Wounded , parched , and powder-blackened , they were still filled with the mad courage of desperate men who knew that death could come in no more terrible form than through surrender . The stone staircase ran straight up from the kitchen to the main hall , and the door , which had been barricaded across the lower part by two mattresses , commanded the whole flight . Hoarse whisperings and the click of the cocking of guns from below told that the Iroquois were mustering for a rush . `` Put the lantern by the door , '' said Du Lhut , `` so that it may throw the light upon the stair . There is only room for three to fire , but you can all load and pass the guns . Monsieur Green , will you kneel with me , and you , Jean Duval ? If one of us is hit let another take his place at once . Now be ready , for they are coming ! `` As he spoke there was a shrill whistle from below , and in an instant the stair was filled with rushing red figures and waving weapons . Bang ! Bang ! Bang ! went the three guns , and then again and again Bang ! Bang ! Bang ! The smoke was so thick in the low-roofed room that they could hardly see to pass the muskets to the eager hands which grasped for them . But no Iroquois had reached the barricade , and there was no patter of their feet now upon the stair . Nothing but an angry snarling and an occasional groan from below . The marksmen were uninjured , but they ceased to fire and waited for the smoke to clear.And when it cleared they saw how deadly their aim had been at those close quarters . Only nine shots had been fired , and seven Indians were littered up and down on the straight stone stair . Five of them lay motionless , but two tried to crawl slowly back to their friends . Du Lhut and thecensitaireraised their muskets , and the two crippled men lay still . `` By Saint Anne ! '' said the old pioneer , as he rammed home another bullet . `` If they have our scalps we have sold them at a great price . A hundred squaws will be howling in their villages when they hear of this day 's work . `` `` Ay , they will not forget their welcome at Sainte Marie , '' said the old nobleman . `` I must again express my deep regret , my dear De Catinat , that you and your wife should have been put to such inconvenience when you have been good enough to visit me . I trust that she and the others are safe at the fort by this time . `` `` May God grant that they are ! Oh , I shall never have an easy moment until I see her once more . `` `` If they are safe we may expect help in the morning , if we can hold out so long . Chambly , the commandant , is not a man to leave a comrade at a pinch . `` The cards were still laid out at one end of the table , with the tricks overlapping each other , as they had left them on the previous morning . But there was something else there of more interest to them , for the breakfast had not been cleared away , and they had been fighting all day with hardly bite or sup . Even when face to face with death , Nature still cries out for her dues , and the hungry men turned savagely upon the loaf , the ham , and the cold wild duck . A little cluster of wine bottles stood upon the buffet , and these had their necks knocked off , and were emptied down parched throats . Three men still took their turn , however , to hold the barricade , for they were not to be caught napping again . The yells and screeches of the savages came up to them as though all the wolves of the forest were cooped up in the basement , but the stair was deserted save for the seven motionless figures . `` They will not try to rush us again , '' said Du Lhut with confidence . `` We have taught them too severe a lesson . `` `` They will set fire to the house . `` `` It will puzzle them to do that , '' said the major-domo . `` It is solid stone , walls and stair , save only for a few beams of wood , very different from those other cottages. '' '' Hush ! '' cried Amos Green , and raised his hand . The yells had died away , and they heard the heavy thud of a mallet beating upon wood . `` What can it be ? `` `` Some fresh devilry , no doubt .
