mound of fluffy grey dust upon the glass table . `` And this is protyle , '' said Haw , passing his fingers through it . `` The chemist of the future may resolve it into further constituents , but to me it is the Ultima Thule . `` `` And now , Robert , '' he continued , after a pause , `` I have shown you enough to enable you to understand something of my system . This is the great secret . It is the secret which endows the man who knows it with such a universal power as no man has ever enjoyed since the world was made . This secret it is the dearest wish of my heart to use for good , and I swear to you , Robert McIntyre , that if I thought it would tend to anything but good I would have done with it for ever . No , I would neither use it myself nor would any other man learn it from my lips . I swear it by all that is holy and solemn ! `` His eyes flashed as he spoke , and his voice quivered with emotion . Standing , pale and lanky , amid his electrodes and his retorts , there was still something majestic about this man , who , amid all his stupendous good fortune , could still keep his moral sense undazzled by the glitter of his gold . Robert 's weak nature had never before realised the strength which lay in those thin , firm lips and earnest eyes . `` Surely in your hands , Mr. Haw , nothing but good can come of it , '' he said . `` I hope not -- -I pray not -- -most earnestly do I pray not . I have done for you , Robert , what I might not have done for my own brother had I one , and I have done it because I believe and hope that you are a man who would not use this power , should you inherit it , for selfish ends . But even now I have not told you all . There is one link which I have withheld from you , and which shall be withheld from you while I live . But look at this chest , Robert . `` He led him to a great iron-clamped chest which stood in the corner , and , throwing it open , he took from it a small case of carved ivory . `` Inside this , '' he said , `` I have left a paper which makes clear anything which is still hidden from you . Should anything happen to me you will always be able to inherit my powers , and to continue my plans by following the directions which are there expressed . And now , '' he continued , throwing his casket back again into the box , `` I shall frequently require your help , but I do not think it will be necessary this morning . I have already taken up too much of your time . If you are going back to Elmdene I wish that you would tell Laura that I shall be with her in the afternoon . `` And so the great secret was out , and Robert walked home with his head in a whirl , and the blood tingling in his veins . He had shivered as he came up at the damp cold of the wind and the sight of the mist-mottled landscape . That was all gone now . His own thoughts tinged everything with sunshine , and he felt inclined to sing and dance as he walked down the muddy , deeply-rutted country lane . Wonderful had been the fate allotted to Raffles Haw , but surely hardly less important that which had come upon himself . He was the sharer of the alchemist 's secret , and the heir to an inheritance which combined a wealth greater than that of monarchs , to a freedom such as monarchs can not enjoy . This was a destiny indeed ! A thousand gold-tinted visions of his future life rose up before him , and in fancy he already sat high above the human race , with prostrate thousands imploring his aid , or thanking him for his benevolence.How sordid seemed the untidy garden , with its scrappy bushes and gaunt elm trees ! How mean the plain brick front , with the green wooden porch ! It had always offended his artistic sense , but now it was obtrusive in its ugliness . The plain room , too , with the American leather chairs , the dull-coloured carpet , and the patchwork rug , he felt a loathing for it all . The only pretty thing in it , upon which his eyes could rest with satisfaction , was his sister , as she leaned back in her chair by the fire with her white , clear beautiful face outlined against the dark background . `` Do you know , Robert , '' she said , glancing up at him from under her long black lashes , `` Papa grows unendurable . I have had to speak very plainly to him , and to make him understand that I am marrying for my own benefit and not for his . `` `` Where is he , then ? `` `` I do n't know . At the Three Pigeons , no doubt . He spends most of his time there now . He flew off in a passion , and talked such nonsense about marriage settlements , and forbidding the banns , and so on . His notion of a marriage settlement appears to be a settlement upon the bride 's father . He should wait quietly , and see what can be done for him . `` `` I think , Laura , that we must make a good deal of allowance for him , '' said Robert earnestly . `` I have noticed a great change in him lately . I do n't think he is himself at all . I must get some medical advice . But I have been up at the Hall this morning . `` `` Have you ? Have you seen Raffles ? Did he send anything for me ? `` `` He said that he would come down when he had finished his work . `` `` But what is the matter , Robert ? '' cried Laura , with the swift perception of womanhood . `` You are flushed , and your eyes are shining , and really you look quite handsome . Raffles has been telling you something ! What was it ? Oh , I know ! He has been telling you how he made his money . Has n't he , now ? `` `` Well , yes . He took me partly into his confidence . I congratulate you , Laura , with all my heart , for you will be a very wealthy woman . `` `` How strange it seems that he should have come to us in our poverty . It is all owing to you , you dear old Robert ; for if he had not taken a fancy to you , he would never have come down to Elmdene and taken a fancy to some one else . `` `` Not at all , '' Robert answered , sitting down by his sister , and patting her hand affectionately . `` It was a clear case of love at first sight . He was in love with you before he ever knew your name . He asked me about you the very first time I saw him . `` `` But tell me about his money , Bob , '' said his sister . `` He has not told me yet , and I am so curious . How did he make it ? It was not from his father ; he told me that himself . His father was just a country doctor . How did he do it ? `` `` I am bound over to secrecy . He will tell you himself . `` `` Oh , but only tell me if I guess right . He had it left him by an uncle , eh ? Well , by a friend ? Or he took out some wonderful patent ? Or he discovered a mine ? Or oil ? Do tell me , Robert ! `` `` I must n't , really , '' cried her brother laughing . `` And I must not talk to you any more . You are much too sharp . I feel a responsibility about it ; and , besides , I must really do some work . `` `` It Is very unkind of you , '' said Laura , pouting . `` But I must put my things on , for I go into Birmingham by the 1.20 . `` `` To Birmingham ? `` `` Yes , I have a hundred things to order . There is everything to be got . You men forget about these details . Raffles wishes to have the wedding in little more than a fortnight . Of course it will be very quiet , but still one needs something . `` `` So early as that ! '' said Robert , thoughtfully . `` Well , perhaps it is better so . `` `` Much better , Robert . Would it not be dreadful if Hector came back first and there was a scene ? If I were once married I should not mind . Why should I ? But of course Raffles knows nothing about him , and it would be terrible if they came together . `` `` That must be avoided at any cost . `` `` Oh , I can not bear even to think of it . Poor Hector ! And yet what could I do , Robert ? You know that it was only a boy and girl affair . And how could I refuse such an offer as this ? It was a duty to my family , was it not ? `` `` You were placed in a difficult position -- -very difficult , '' her brother answered . `` But all will be right , and I have no doubt Hector will see it as you do . But does Mr. Spurling know of your engagement ? `` `` Not a word . He was here yesterday , and talked of Hector , but indeed I did not know how to tell him . We are to be married by special licence in Birmingham , so really there is no reason why he should know . But now I must hurry or I shall miss my train . `` When his sister was gone Robert went up to his studio , and having ground some colours upon his palette he stood for some time , brush and mahlstick in hand , in front of his big bare canvas . But how profitless all his work seemed to him now ! What object had he in doing it ? Was it to earn money ? Money could be had for the asking , or , for that matter , without the asking . Or was it to produce a thing of beauty ? But he had artistic faults . Raffles Haw had said so , and he knew that he was right . After all his pains the thing might not please ; and with money he could at all times buy pictures which would please , and which would be things of beauty . What , then , was the object
