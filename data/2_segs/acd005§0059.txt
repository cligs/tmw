danger , but we know it , and we will not let our White Lily run into it . You will stay here to gladden us , while the great chief Du Lhut , and the French soldier , your husband , and the old warrior who seems so wary , and the other chief with limbs like the wild deer , go forward through the woods and see that all is well before you venture . `` And so it was at last agreed , and Adele , still protesting , was consigned to the care of the lady of Sainte Marie , while De Catinat swore that without a pause he would return from Poitou to fetch her . The old nobleman and his son would fain have joined them in their adventure , but they had their own charge to watch and the lives of many in their keeping , while a small party were safer in the woods than a larger one would be . The seigneur provided them with a letter for De Lannes , the governor of the Poitou blockhouse , and so in the early dawn the four of them crept like shadows from the stockade-gate , amid the muttered good wishes of the guard within , and were lost in an instant in the blackness of the vast forest.From La Noue to Poitou was but twelve miles down the river , but by the woodland route where creeks were to be crossed , reed-girt lakes to be avoided , and paths to be picked among swamps where the wild rice grew higher than their heads , and the alder bushes lay in dense clumps before them , the distance was more than doubled . They walked in single file , Du Lhut leading , with the swift silent tread of some wild creature , his body bent forward , his gun ready in the bend of his arm , and his keen dark eyes shooting little glances to right and left , observing everything from the tiniest mark upon the ground or tree trunk to the motion of every beast and bird of the brushwood . De Catinat walked behind , then Ephraim Savage , and then Amos , all with their weapons ready and with every sense upon the alert . By midday they were more than half-way , and halted in a thicket for a scanty meal of bread and cheese , for De Lhut would not permit them to light a fire . `` They have not come as far as this , '' he whispered , `` and yet I am sure that they have crossed the river . Ah , Governor de la Barre did not know what he did when he stirred these men up , and this good dragoon whom the king has sent us now knows even less . `` `` I have seen them in peace , '' remarked Amos . `` I have traded to Onondaga and to the country of the Senecas . I know them as fine hunters and brave men . `` `` They are fine hunters , but the game that they hunt best are their fellow-men . I have myself led their scalping parties , and I have fought against them , and I tell you that when a general comes out from France who hardly knows enough to get the sun behind him in a fight , he will find that there is little credit to be gained from them . They talk of burning their villages ! It would be as wise to kick over the wasps ' nest , and think that you have done with the wasps . You are from New England , monsieur ? `` `` My comrade is from New England ; I am from New York . `` `` Ah , yes . I could see from your step and your eye that the woods were as a home to you . The New England man goes on the waters and he slays the cod with more pleasure than the caribou . Perhaps that is why his face is so sad . I have been on the great water , and I remember that my face was sad also . There is little wind , and so I think that we may light our pipes without danger . With a good breeze I have known a burning pipe fetch up a scalping party from two miles ' distance , but the trees stop scent , and the Iroquois noses are less keen than the Sioux and the Dacotah . God help you , monsieur , if you should ever have an Indian war . It is bad for us , but it would be a thousand times worse for you . `` `` And why ? `` `` Because we have fought the Indians from the first , and we have them always in our mind when we build . You see how along this river every house and every hamlet supports its neighbour ? But you , by Saint Anne of Beaupre , it made my scalp tingle when I came on your frontiers and saw the lonely farm-houses and little clearings out in the woods with no help for twenty leagues around . An Indian war is a purgatory for Canada , but it would be a hell for the English Provinces ! `` `` We are good friends with the Indians , '' said Amos . `` We do not wish to conquer . `` `` Your people have a way of conquering although they say that they do not wish to do it , '' remarked Du Lhut . `` Now , with us , we bang our drums , and wave our flags , and make a stir , but no very big thing has come of it yet . We have never had but two great men in Canada . One was Monsieur de la Salle , who was shot last year by his own men down the great river , and the other , old Frontenac , will have to come back again if New France is not to be turned into a desert by the Five Nations . It would surprise me little if by this time two years the white and gold flag flew only over the rock of Quebec . But I see that you look at me impatiently , Monsieur de Catinat , and I know that you count the hours until we are back at Sainte Marie again . Forward , then , and may the second part of our journey be as peaceful as the first . `` For an hour or more they picked their way through the woods , following in the steps of the old French pioneer . It was a lovely day with hardly a cloud in the heavens , and the sun streaming down through the thick foliage covered the shaded sward with a delicate network of gold . Sometimes where the woods opened they came out into the pure sunlight , but only to pass into thick glades beyond , where a single ray , here and there , was all that could break its way through the vast leafy covering . It would have been beautiful , these sudden transitions from light to shade , but with the feeling of impending danger , and of a horror ever lurking in these shadows , the mind was tinged with awe rather than admiration . Silently , lightly , the four men picked their steps among the great tree trunks.Suddenly Du Lhut dropped upon his knees and stooped his ear to the ground . He rose , shook his head , and walked on with a grave face , casting quick little glances into the shadows in every direction . `` Did you hear something ? '' whispered Amos.Du Lhut put his finger to his lips , and then in an instant was down again upon his face with his ear fixed to the ground . He sprang up with the look of a man who has heard what he expected to hear . `` Walk on , '' said he quietly , `` and behave exactly as you have done all day . `` `` What is it , then ? '' '' Indians . `` `` In front of us ? `` `` No , behind us . `` `` What are they doing ? `` `` They are following us . `` `` How many of them ? `` `` Two , I think . `` The friends glanced back involuntarily over their shoulders into the dense blackness of the forest . At one point a single broad shaft of light slid down between two pines and cast a golden blotch upon their track . Save for this one vivid spot all was sombre and silent . `` Do not look round , '' whispered Du Lhut sharply . `` Walk on as before . `` `` Are they enemies ? `` `` They are Iroquois . `` `` And pursuing us ? `` `` No , we are now pursuing them . `` `` Shall we turn , then ? `` `` No , they would vanish like shadows , '' '' How far off are they ? `` `` About two hundred paces , I think . `` `` They can not see us , then ? `` `` I think not , but I can not be sure . They are following our trail , I think . `` `` What shall we do , then ? `` `` Let us make a circle and get behind them . `` Turning sharp to the left he led them in a long curve through the woods , hurrying swiftly and yet silently under the darkest shadows of the trees . Then he turned again , and presently halted . `` This is our own track , '' said he . `` Ay , and two Redskins have passed over it , '' cried Amos , bending down , and pointing to marks which were entirely invisible to Ephraim Savage or De Catinat . `` A full-grown warrior and a lad on his first warpath , '' said Du Lhut . `` They were moving fast , you see , for you can hardly see the heel marks of their moccasins . They walked one behind the other . Now let us follow them as they followed us , and see if we have better luck . `` He sped swiftly along the trail with his musket cocked in his hand , the others following hard upon his heels , but there was no sound , and no sign of life from the shadowy woods in front of them . Suddenly Du Lhut stopped and grounded his weapon . `` They are still behind us , '' he said . `` Still behind us ? '' '' Yes . This is the point where we branched off . They have hesitated a moment , as you can see by their footmarks , and then they have followed on . `` `` If we go round again and quicken our pace we may overtake them . `` `` No , they are on their guard now . They must know that it could only be on their account that we went back on our tracks . Lie here behind the fallen log and we shall see if we can catch a glimpse of them . `` A great rotten trunk , all green with mould and blotched with pink and purple fungi , lay to one side of where they stood . Behind this the Frenchman crouched , and his three companions followed his example , peering through
