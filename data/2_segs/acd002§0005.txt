convict prison of Princetown . Between and around these scattered points extends the desolate , lifeless moor . This , then , is the stage upon which tragedy has been played , and upon which we may help to play it again . `` `` It must be a wild place . `` `` Yes , the setting is a worthy one . If the devil did desire to have a hand in the affairs of men -- - '' '' Then you are yourself inclining to the supernatural explanation . `` `` The devil 's agents may be of flesh and blood , may they not ? There are two questions waiting for us at the outset . The one is whether any crime has been committed at all ; the second is , what is the crime and how was it committed ? Of course , if Dr. Mortimer 's surmise should be correct , and we are dealing with forces outside the ordinary laws of Nature , there is an end of our investigation . But we are bound to exhaust all other hypotheses before falling back upon this one . I think we 'll shut that window again , if you do n't mind . It is a singular thing , but I find that a concentrated atmosphere helps a concentration of thought . I have not pushed it to the length of getting into a box to think , but that is the logical outcome of my convictions . Have you turned the case over in your mind ? `` `` Yes , I have thought a good deal of it in the course of the day . `` `` What do you make of it ? `` `` It is very bewildering . `` `` It has certainly a character of its own . There are points of distinction about it . That change in the footprints , for example . What do you make of that ? `` `` Mortimer said that the man had walked on tiptoe down that portion of the alley . `` `` He only repeated what some fool had said at the inquest . Why should a man walk on tiptoe down the alley ? `` `` What then ? `` `` He was running , Watson -- -running desperately , running for his life , running until he burst his heart -- -and fell dead upon his face . `` `` Running from what ? `` `` There lies our problem . There are indications that the man was crazed with fear before ever he began to run . `` `` How can you say that ? `` `` I am presuming that the cause of his fears came to him across the moor . If that were so , and it seems most probable , only a man who had lost his wits would have run from the house instead of towards it . If the gipsy 's evidence may be taken as true , he ran with cries for help in the direction where help was least likely to be . Then , again , whom was he waiting for that night , and why was he waiting for him in the yew alley rather than in his own house ? `` `` You think that he was waiting for someone ? `` `` The man was elderly and infirm . We can understand his taking an evening stroll , but the ground was damp and the night inclement . Is it natural that he should stand for five or ten minutes , as Dr. Mortimer , with more practical sense than I should have given him credit for , deduced from the cigar ash ? `` `` But he went out every evening . `` `` I think it unlikely that he waited at the moor-gate every evening . On the contrary , the evidence is that he avoided the moor . That night he waited there . It was the night before he made his departure for London . The thing takes shape , Watson . It becomes coherent . Might I ask you to hand me my violin , and we will postpone all further thought upon this business until we have had the advantage of meeting Dr. Mortimer and Sir Henry Baskerville in the morning . `` Our breakfast table was cleared early , and Holmes waited in his dressing-gown for the promised interview . Our clients were punctual to their appointment , for the clock had just struck ten when Dr. Mortimer was shown up , followed by the young baronet . The latter was a small , alert , dark-eyed man about thirty years of age , very sturdily built , with thick black eyebrows and a strong , pugnacious face . He wore a ruddy-tinted tweed suit and had the weather-beaten appearance of one who has spent most of his time in the open air , and yet there was something in his steady eye and the quiet assurance of his bearing which indicated the gentleman . `` This is Sir Henry Baskerville , '' said Dr . Mortimer . `` Why , yes , '' said he , `` and the strange thing is , Mr. Sherlock Holmes , that if my friend here had not proposed coming round to you this morning I should have come on my own account . I understand that you think out little puzzles , and I 've had one this morning which wants more thinking out than I am able to give it . `` `` Pray take a seat , Sir Henry . Do I understand you to say that you have yourself had some remarkable experience since you arrived in London ? `` `` Nothing of much importance , Mr. Holmes . Only a joke , as like as not . It was this letter , if you can call it a letter , which reached me this morning . `` He laid an envelope upon the table , and we all bent over it . It was of common quality , grayish in colour . The address , `` Sir Henry Baskerville , Northumberland Hotel , '' was printed in rough characters ; the post-mark `` Charing Cross , '' and the date of posting the preceding evening . `` Who knew that you were going to the Northumberland Hotel ? '' asked Holmes , glancing keenly across at our visitor . `` No one could have known . We only decided after I met Dr . Mortimer . `` `` But Dr. Mortimer was no doubt already stopping there ? `` `` No , I had been staying with a friend , '' said the doctor . `` There was no possible indication that we intended to go to this hotel. '' '' Hum ! Someone seems to be very deeply interested in your movements . '' Out of the envelope he took a half-sheet of foolscap paper folded into four . This he opened and spread flat upon the table . Across the middle of it a single sentence had been formed by the expedient of pasting printed words upon it . It ran : As you value your life or your reason keep away from the moor.The word `` moor '' only was printed in ink . `` Now , '' said Sir Henry Baskerville , `` perhaps you will tell me , Mr. Holmes , what in thunder is the meaning of that , and who it is that takes so much interest in my affairs ? `` `` What do you make of it , Dr. Mortimer ? You must allow that there is nothing supernatural about this , at any rate ? `` `` No , sir , but it might very well come from someone who was convinced that the business is supernatural . `` `` What business ? '' asked Sir Henry sharply . `` It seems to me that all you gentlemen know a great deal more than I do about my own affairs . `` `` You shall share our knowledge before you leave this room , Sir Henry . I promise you that , '' said Sherlock Holmes . `` We will confine ourselves for the present with your permission to this very interesting document , which must have been put together and posted yesterday evening . Have you yesterday 's Times , Watson ? `` `` It is here in the corner . `` `` Might I trouble you for it -- -the inside page , please , with the leading articles ? '' He glanced swiftly over it , running his eyes up and down the columns . `` Capital article this on free trade . Permit me to give you an extract from it . 'You may be cajoled into imagining that your own special trade or your own industry will be encouraged by a protective tariff , but it stands to reason that such legislation must in the long run keep away wealth from the country , diminish the value of our imports , and lower the general conditions of life in this island . ' '' What do you think of that , Watson ? '' cried Holmes in high glee , rubbing his hands together with satisfaction . `` Do n't you think that is an admirable sentiment ? '' Dr . Mortimer looked at Holmes with an air of professional interest , and Sir Henry Baskerville turned a pair of puzzled dark eyes upon me . `` I do n't know much about the tariff and things of that kind , '' said he , `` but it seems to me we 've got a bit off the trail so far as that note is concerned . `` `` On the contrary , I think we are particularly hot upon the trail , Sir Henry . Watson here knows more about my methods than you do , but I fear that even he has not quite grasped the significance of this sentence . `` `` No , I confess that I see no connection . `` `` And yet , my dear Watson , there is so very close a connection that the one is extracted out of the other . 'You , ' 'your , ' 'your , ' 'life , ' 'reason , ' 'value , ' 'keep away , ' 'from the . ' Do n't you see now whence these words have been taken ? `` `` By thunder , you 're right ! Well , if that is n't smart ! '' cried Sir Henry . `` If any possible doubt remained it is settled by the fact that 'keep away ' and 'from the ' are cut out in one piece . `` `` Well , now -- -so it is ! `` `` Really , Mr. Holmes , this exceeds anything which I could have imagined , '' said Dr. Mortimer , gazing at my friend in amazement . `` I could understand anyone saying that the words were from a newspaper ; but that you should name which , and add that it came from the leading article , is really one of the most remarkable things which I have ever known . How did you do it ? `` `` I presume , Doctor , that you could tell the skull of a negro from that of an Esquimau ? `` `` Most certainly . `` `` But how ? `` `` Because that is my special hobby . The differences are obvious . The supra-orbital crest , the facial angle , the maxillary curve , the -- - '' '' But this is my special hobby , and the differences are equally obvious . There is as much difference
