district which was for so long a period haunted by their terrible presence . Why should these pages be stained by further crimes ? Have I not said enough to show the men and their methods ? These deeds are written in history , and there are records wherein one may read the details of them . There one may learn of the shooting of Policemen Hunt and Evans because they had ventured to arrest two members of the society -- -a double outrage planned at the Vermissa lodge and carried out in cold blood upon two helpless and disarmed men . There also one may read of the shooting of Mrs. Larbey when she was nursing her husband , who had been beaten almost to death by orders of Boss McGinty . The killing of the elder Jenkins , shortly followed by that of his brother , the mutilation of James Murdoch , the blowing up of the Staphouse family , and the murder of the Stendals all followed hard upon one another in the same terrible winter.Darkly the shadow lay upon the Valley of Fear . The spring had come with running brooks and blossoming trees . There was hope for all Nature bound so long in an iron grip ; but nowhere was there any hope for the men and women who lived under the yoke of the terror . Never had the cloud above them been so dark and hopeless as in the early summer of the year 1875.It was the height of the reign of terror . McMurdo , who had already been appointed Inner Deacon , with every prospect of some day succeeding McGinty as Bodymaster , was now so necessary to the councils of his comrades that nothing was done without his help and advice . The more popular he became , however , with the Freemen , the blacker were the scowls which greeted him as he passed along the streets of Vermissa . In spite of their terror the citizens were taking heart to band themselves together against their oppressors . Rumours had reached the lodge of secret gatherings in the Herald office and of distribution of firearms among the law-abiding people . But McGinty and his men were undisturbed by such reports . They were numerous , resolute , and well armed . Their opponents were scattered and powerless . It would all end , as it had done in the past , in aimless talk and possibly in impotent arrests . So said McGinty , McMurdo , and all the bolder spirits.It was a Saturday evening in May . Saturday was always the lodge night , and McMurdo was leaving his house to attend it when Morris , the weaker brother of the order , came to see him . His brow was creased with care , and his kindly face was drawn and haggard . `` Can I speak with you freely , Mr . McMurdo ? '' '' Sure . `` `` I ca n't forget that I spoke my heart to you once , and that you kept it to yourself , even though the Boss himself came to ask you about it . `` `` What else could I do if you trusted me ? It was n't that I agreed with what you said . `` `` I know that well . But you are the one that I can speak to and be safe . I 've a secret here , '' he put his hand to his breast , `` and it is just burning the life out of me . I wish it had come to any one of you but me . If I tell it , it will mean murder , for sure . If I do n't , it may bring the end of us all . God help me , but I am near out of my wits over it ! `` McMurdo looked at the man earnestly . He was trembling in every limb . He poured some whisky into a glass and handed it to him . `` That 's the physic for the likes of you , '' said he . `` Now let me hear of it . `` Morris drank , and his white face took a tinge of colour . `` I can tell it to you all in one sentence , '' said he . `` There 's a detective on our trail . `` McMurdo stared at him in astonishment . `` Why , man , you 're crazy , '' he said . `` Is n't the place full of police and detectives and what harm did they ever do us ? `` `` No , no , it 's no man of the district . As you say , we know them , and it is little that they can do . But you 've heard of Pinkerton 's ? `` `` I 've read of some folk of that name . `` `` Well , you can take it from me you 've no show when they are on your trail . It 's not a take-it-or-miss-it government concern . It 's a dead earnest business proposition that 's out for results and keeps out till by hook or crook it gets them . If a Pinkerton man is deep in this business , we are all destroyed . `` `` We must kill him . `` `` Ah , it 's the first thought that came to you ! So it will be up at the lodge . Did n't I say to you that it would end in murder ? `` `` Sure , what is murder ? Is n't it common enough in these parts ? `` `` It is , indeed ; but it 's not for me to point out the man that is to be murdered . I 'd never rest easy again . And yet it 's our own necks that may be at stake . In God 's name what shall I do ? '' He rocked to and fro in his agony of indecision.But his words had moved McMurdo deeply . It was easy to see that he shared the other 's opinion as to the danger , and the need for meeting it . He gripped Morris 's shoulder and shook him in his earnestness . `` See here , man , '' he cried , and he almost screeched the words in his excitement , `` you wo n't gain anything by sitting keening like an old wife at a wake . Let 's have the facts . Who is the fellow ? Where is he ? How did you hear of him ? Why did you come to me ? `` `` I came to you ; for you are the one man that would advise me . I told you that I had a store in the East before I came here . I left good friends behind me , and one of them is in the telegraph service . Here 's a letter that I had from him yesterday . It 's this part from the top of the page . You can read it yourself . `` This was what McMurdo read : How are the Scowrers getting on in your parts ? We read plenty of them in the papers . Between you and me I expect to hear news from you before long . Five big corporations and the two railroads have taken the thing up in dead earnest . They mean it , and you can bet they 'll get there ! They are right deep down into it . Pinkerton has taken hold under their orders , and his best man , Birdy Edwards , is operating . The thing has got to be stopped right now . `` Now read the postscript . `` Of course , what I give you is what I learned in business ; so it goes no further . It 's a queer cipher that you handle by the yard every day and can get no meaning from.McMurdo sat in silence for some time , with the letter in his listless hands . The mist had lifted for a moment , and there was the abyss before him . `` Does anyone else know of this ? '' he asked . `` I have told no one else . `` `` But this man -- -your friend -- -has he any other person that he would be likely to write to ? `` `` Well , I dare say he knows one or two more . `` `` Of the lodge ? `` `` It 's likely enough . `` `` I was asking because it is likely that he may have given some description of this fellow Birdy Edwards -- -then we could get on his trail . `` `` Well , it 's possible . But I should not think he knew him . He is just telling me the news that came to him by way of business . How would he know this Pinkerton man ? `` McMurdo gave a violent start . `` By Gar ! '' he cried , `` I 've got him . What a fool I was not to know it . Lord ! but we 're in luck ! We will fix him before he can do any harm . See here , Morris , will you leave this thing in my hands ? `` `` Sure , if you will only take it off mine . `` `` I 'll do that . You can stand right back and let me run it . Even your name need not be mentioned . I 'll take it all on myself , as if it were to me that this letter has come . Will that content you ? `` `` It 's just what I would ask . `` `` Then leave it at that and keep your head shut . Now I 'll get down to the lodge , and we 'll soon make old man Pinkerton sorry for himself . `` `` You would n't kill this man ? `` `` The less you know , Friend Morris , the easier your conscience will be , and the better you will sleep . Ask no questions , and let these things settle themselves . I have hold of it now . `` Morris shook his head sadly as he left . `` I feel that his blood is on my hands , '' he groaned . `` Self-protection is no murder , anyhow , '' said McMurdo , smiling grimly . `` It 's him or us . I guess this man would destroy us all if we left him long in the valley . Why , Brother Morris , we 'll have to elect you Bodymaster yet ; for you 've surely saved the lodge . `` And yet it was clear from his actions that he thought more seriously of this new intrusion than his words would show . It may have been his guilty conscience , it may have been the reputation of the Pinkerton organization , it may have been the knowledge that great , rich corporations had set themselves the task of clearing out the Scowrers ; but , whatever his reason , his actions were those of a man who is preparing for the worst . Every paper which would incriminate him was destroyed before he left the house . After that he gave a long sigh of satisfaction ; for it seemed to him that he was safe . And yet the danger must still have pressed somewhat upon him ; for on his way to the lodge he stopped at old
