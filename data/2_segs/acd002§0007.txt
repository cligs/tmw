Holmes , it 's half-past eleven now and I am going back right away to my hotel . Suppose you and your friend , Dr. Watson , come round and lunch with us at two . I 'll be able to tell you more clearly then how this thing strikes me . `` `` Is that convenient to you , Watson ? '' '' Perfectly . `` `` Then you may expect us . Shall I have a cab called ? `` `` I 'd prefer to walk , for this affair has flurried me rather . `` `` I 'll join you in a walk , with pleasure , '' said his companion . `` Then we meet again at two o'clock . Au revoir , and good-morning ! `` We heard the steps of our visitors descend the stair and the bang of the front door . In an instant Holmes had changed from the languid dreamer to the man of action . `` Your hat and boots , Watson , quick ! Not a moment to lose ! '' He rushed into his room in his dressing-gown and was back again in a few seconds in a frock-coat . We hurried together down the stairs and into the street . Dr. Mortimer and Baskerville were still visible about two hundred yards ahead of us in the direction of Oxford Street . `` Shall I run on and stop them ? `` `` Not for the world , my dear Watson . I am perfectly satisfied with your company if you will tolerate mine . Our friends are wise , for it is certainly a very fine morning for a walk . `` He quickened his pace until we had decreased the distance which divided us by about half . Then , still keeping a hundred yards behind , we followed into Oxford Street and so down Regent Street . Once our friends stopped and stared into a shop window , upon which Holmes did the same . An instant afterwards he gave a little cry of satisfaction , and , following the direction of his eager eyes , I saw that a hansom cab with a man inside which had halted on the other side of the street was now proceeding slowly onward again . `` There 's our man , Watson ! Come along ! We 'll have a good look at him , if we can do no more . `` At that instant I was aware of a bushy black beard and a pair of piercing eyes turned upon us through the side window of the cab . Instantly the trapdoor at the top flew up , something was screamed to the driver , and the cab flew madly off down Regent Street . Holmes looked eagerly round for another , but no empty one was in sight . Then he dashed in wild pursuit amid the stream of the traffic , but the start was too great , and already the cab was out of sight . `` There now ! '' said Holmes bitterly as he emerged panting and white with vexation from the tide of vehicles . `` Was ever such bad luck and such bad management , too ? Watson , Watson , if you are an honest man you will record this also and set it against my successes ! `` `` Who was the man ? `` `` I have not an idea . `` `` A spy ? `` `` Well , it was evident from what we have heard that Baskerville has been very closely shadowed by someone since he has been in town . How else could it be known so quickly that it was the Northumberland Hotel which he had chosen ? If they had followed him the first day I argued that they would follow him also the second . You may have observed that I twice strolled over to the window while Dr. Mortimer was reading his legend . `` `` Yes , I remember . `` `` I was looking out for loiterers in the street , but I saw none . We are dealing with a clever man , Watson . This matter cuts very deep , and though I have not finally made up my mind whether it is a benevolent or a malevolent agency which is in touch with us , I am conscious always of power and design . When our friends left I at once followed them in the hopes of marking down their invisible attendant . So wily was he that he had not trusted himself upon foot , but he had availed himself of a cab so that he could loiter behind or dash past them and so escape their notice . His method had the additional advantage that if they were to take a cab he was all ready to follow them . It has , however , one obvious disadvantage . `` `` It puts him in the power of the cabman. '' '' Exactly . `` `` What a pity we did not get the number ! `` `` My dear Watson , clumsy as I have been , you surely do not seriously imagine that I neglected to get the number ? No . 2704 is our man . But that is no use to us for the moment . `` `` I fail to see how you could have done more . `` `` On observing the cab I should have instantly turned and walked in the other direction . I should then at my leisure have hired a second cab and followed the first at a respectful distance , or , better still , have driven to the Northumberland Hotel and waited there . When our unknown had followed Baskerville home we should have had the opportunity of playing his own game upon himself and seeing where he made for . As it is , by an indiscreet eagerness , which was taken advantage of with extraordinary quickness and energy by our opponent , we have betrayed ourselves and lost our man . `` We had been sauntering slowly down Regent Street during this conversation , and Dr. Mortimer , with his companion , had long vanished in front of us . `` There is no object in our following them , '' said Holmes . `` The shadow has departed and will not return . We must see what further cards we have in our hands and play them with decision . Could you swear to that man 's face within the cab ? `` `` I could swear only to the beard . `` `` And so could I -- -from which I gather that in all probability it was a false one . A clever man upon so delicate an errand has no use for a beard save to conceal his features . Come in here , Watson ! `` He turned into one of the district messenger offices , where he was warmly greeted by the manager . `` Ah , Wilson , I see you have not forgotten the little case in which I had the good fortune to help you ? `` `` No , sir , indeed I have not . You saved my good name , and perhaps my life . `` `` My dear fellow , you exaggerate . I have some recollection , Wilson , that you had among your boys a lad named Cartwright , who showed some ability during the investigation . `` `` Yes , sir , he is still with us . `` `` Could you ring him up ? -- -thank you ! And I should be glad to have change of this five-pound note . `` A lad of fourteen , with a bright , keen face , had obeyed the summons of the manager . He stood now gazing with great reverence at the famous detective . `` Let me have the Hotel Directory , '' said Holmes . `` Thank you ! Now , Cartwright , there are the names of twenty-three hotels here , all in the immediate neighbourhood of Charing Cross . Do you see ? `` `` Yes , sir . `` `` You will visit each of these in turn . `` `` Yes , sir . `` `` You will begin in each case by giving the outside porter one shilling . Here are twenty-three shillings . `` `` Yes , sir . `` `` You will tell him that you want to see the waste-paper of yesterday . You will say that an important telegram has miscarried and that you are looking for it . You understand ? `` `` Yes , sir . `` `` But what you are really looking for is the centre page of the Times with some holes cut in it with scissors . Here is a copy of the Times . It is this page . You could easily recognize it , could you not ? `` `` Yes , sir . `` `` In each case the outside porter will send for the hall porter , to whom also you will give a shilling . Here are twenty-three shillings . You will then learn in possibly twenty cases out of the twenty-three that the waste of the day before has been burned or removed . In the three other cases you will be shown a heap of paper and you will look for this page of the Times among it . The odds are enormously against your finding it . There are ten shillings over in case of emergencies . Let me have a report by wire at Baker Street before evening . And now , Watson , it only remains for us to find out by wire the identity of the cabman , No . 2704 , and then we will drop into one of the Bond Street picture galleries and fill in the time until we are due at the hotel . `` Sherlock Holmes had , in a very remarkable degree , the power of detaching his mind at will . For two hours the strange business in which we had been involved appeared to be forgotten , and he was entirely absorbed in the pictures of the modern Belgian masters . He would talk of nothing but art , of which he had the crudest ideas , from our leaving the gallery until we found ourselves at the Northumberland Hotel . `` Sir Henry Baskerville is upstairs expecting you , '' said the clerk . `` He asked me to show you up at once when you came . `` `` Have you any objection to my looking at your register ? '' said Holmes . `` Not in the least . `` The book showed that two names had been added after that of Baskerville . One was Theophilus Johnson and family , of Newcastle ; the other Mrs. Oldmore and maid , of High Lodge , Alton . `` Surely that must be the same Johnson whom I used to know , '' said Holmes to the porter . `` A lawyer , is he not , gray-headed , and walks with a limp ? `` `` No , sir , this is Mr. Johnson , the coal-owner , a very active gentleman , not older than yourself . `` `` Surely you are mistaken about his trade ? `` `` No , sir ! he has used this hotel for many years , and he is very well known to us . `` `` Ah , that settles it . Mrs. Oldmore , too ; I seem to remember the name . Excuse my curiosity , but often in calling upon one friend one finds another . `` `` She
