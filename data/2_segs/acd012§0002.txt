why I should accept without criticism anything , however far-fetched , which this man may care to put forward ? Are we to have a Pope of science , with infallible decrees laid downex cathedra , and accepted without question by the poor humble public ? I tell you , sir , that I have a brain of my own and that I should feel myself to be a snob and a slave if I did not use it . If it pleases you to believe this rigmarole about ether and Fraunhofer 's lines upon the spectrum , do so by all means , but do not ask one who is older and wiser than yourself to share in your folly . Is it not evident that if the ether were affected to the degree which he maintains , and if it were obnoxious to human health , the result of it would already be apparent upon ourselves ? '' Here he laughed with uproarious triumph over his own argument . `` Yes , sir , we should already be very far from our normal selves , and instead of sitting quietly discussing scientific problems in a railway train we should be showing actual symptoms of the poison which was working within us . Where do we see any signs of this poisonous cosmic disturbance ? Answer me that , sir ! Answer me that ! Come , come , no evasion ! I pin you to an answer ! `` I felt more and more angry . There was something very irritating and aggressive in Summerlee 's demeanour . `` I think that if you knew more about the facts you might be less positive in your opinion , '' said I.Summerlee took his pipe from his mouth and fixed me with a stony stare . `` Pray what do you mean , sir , by that somewhat impertinent observation ? `` `` I mean that when I was leaving the office the news editor told me that a telegram had come in confirming the general illness of the Sumatra natives , and adding that the lights had not been lit in the Straits of Sunda . `` `` Really , there should be some limits to human folly ! '' cried Summerlee in a positive fury . `` Is it possible that you do not realize that ether , if for a moment we adopt Challenger 's preposterous supposition , is a universal substance which is the same here as at the other side of the world ? Do you for an instant suppose that there is an English ether and a Sumatran ether ? Perhaps you imagine that the ether of Kent is in some way superior to the ether of Surrey , through which this train is now bearing us . There really are no bounds to the credulity and ignorance of the average layman . Is it conceivable that the ether in Sumatra should be so deadly as to cause total insensibility at the very time when the ether here has had no appreciable effect upon us whatever ? Personally , I can truly say that I never felt stronger in body or better balanced in mind in my life . `` `` That may be . I do n't profess to be a scientific man , '' said I , `` though I have heard somewhere that the science of one generation is usually the fallacy of the next . But it does not take much common sense to see that , as we seem to know so little about ether , it might be affected by some local conditions in various parts of the world and might show an effect over there which would only develop later with us . `` `` With 'might ' and 'may ' you can prove anything , '' cried Summerlee furiously . `` Pigs may fly . Yes , sir , pigsmayfly -- -but they do n't . It is not worth arguing with you . Challenger has filled you with his nonsense and you are both incapable of reason . I had as soon lay arguments before those railway cushions . `` `` I must say , Professor Summerlee , that your manners do not seem to have improved since I last had the pleasure of meeting you , '' said Lord John severely . `` You lordlings are not accustomed to hear the truth , '' Summerlee answered with a bitter smile . `` It comes as a bit of a shock , does it not , when someone makes you realize that your title leaves you none the less a very ignorant man ? `` `` Upon my word , sir , '' said Lord John , very stern and rigid , `` if you were a younger man you would not dare to speak to me in so offensive a fashion . `` Summerlee thrust out his chin , with its little wagging tuft of goatee beard . `` I would have you know , sir , that , young or old , there has never been a time in my life when I was afraid to speak my mind to an ignorant coxcomb -- -yes , sir , an ignorant coxcomb , if you had as many titles as slaves could invent and fools could adopt . `` For a moment Lord John 's eyes blazed , and then , with a tremendous effort , he mastered his anger and leaned back in his seat with arms folded and a bitter smile upon his face . To me all this was dreadful and deplorable . Like a wave , the memory of the past swept over me , the good comradeship , the happy , adventurous days -- -all that we had suffered and worked for and won . That it should have come to this -- -to insults and abuse ! Suddenly I was sobbing -- -sobbing in loud , gulping , uncontrollable sobs which refused to be concealed . My companions looked at me in surprise . I covered my face with my hands . `` It 's all right , '' said I . `` Only -- -only it *is* such a pity ! `` `` You 're ill , young fellah , that 's what 's amiss with you , '' said Lord John . `` I thought you were queer from the first . `` `` Your habits , sir , have not mended in these three years , '' said Summerlee , shaking his head . `` I also did not fail to observe your strange manner the moment we met . You need not waste your sympathy , Lord John . These tears are purely alcoholic . The man has been drinking . By the way , Lord John , I called you a coxcomb just now , which was perhaps unduly severe . But the word reminds me of a small accomplishment , trivial but amusing , which I used to possess . You know me as the austere man of science . Can you believe that I once had a well-deserved reputation in several nurseries as a farmyard imitator ? Perhaps I can help you to pass the time in a pleasant way . Would it amuse you to hear me crow like a cock ? `` `` No , sir , '' said Lord John , who was still greatly offended , `` it wouldnotamuse me . `` `` My imitation of the clucking hen who had just laid an egg was also considered rather above the average . Might I venture ? `` `` No , sir , no -- -certainly not . `` But in spite of this earnest prohibition , Professor Summerlee laid down his pipe and for the rest of our journey he entertained -- -or failed to entertain -- -us by a succession of bird and animal cries which seemed so absurd that my tears were suddenly changed into boisterous laughter , which must have become quite hysterical as I sat opposite this grave Professor and saw him -- -or rather heard him -- -in the character of the uproarious rooster or the puppy whose tail had been trodden upon . Once Lord John passed across his newspaper , upon the margin of which he had written in pencil , `` Poor devil ! Mad as a hatter . '' No doubt it was very eccentric , and yet the performance struck me as extraordinarily clever and amusing.Whilst this was going on , Lord John leaned forward and told me some interminable story about a buffalo and an Indian rajah which seemed to me to have neither beginning nor end . Professor Summerlee had just begun to chirrup like a canary , and Lord John to get to the climax of his story , when the train drew up at Jarvis Brook , which had been given us as the station for Rotherfield.And there was Challenger to meet us . His appearance was glorious . Not all the turkey-cocks in creation could match the slow , high-stepping dignity with which he paraded his own railway station and the benignant smile of condescending encouragement with which he regarded everybody around him . If he had changed in anything since the days of old , it was that his points had become accentuated . The huge head and broad sweep of forehead , with its plastered lock of black hair , seemed even greater than before . His black beard poured forward in a more impressive cascade , and his clear grey eyes , with their insolent and sardonic eyelids , were even more masterful than of yore.He gave me the amused hand-shake and encouraging smile which the head master bestows upon the small boy , and , having greeted the others and helped to collect their bags and their cylinders of oxygen , he stowed us and them away in a large motor-car which was driven by the same impassive Austin , the man of few words , whom I had seen in the character of butler upon the occasion of my first eventful visit to the Professor . Our journey led us up a winding hill through beautiful country . I sat in front with the chauffeur , but behind me my three comrades seemed to me to be all talking together . Lord John was still struggling with his buffalo story , so far as I could make out , while once again I heard , as of old , the deep rumble of Challenger and the insistent accents of Summerlee as their brains locked in high and fierce scientific debate . Suddenly Austin slanted his mahogany face toward me without taking his eyes from his steering-wheel . `` I 'm under notice , '' said he . `` Dear me ! '' said I.Everything seemed strange to-day . Everyone said queer , unexpected things . It was like a dream . `` It 's forty-seven times , '' said Austin reflectively . `` When do you go ? '' I asked , for want of some better observation . `` I do n't go , '' said Austin.The conversation seemed to have ended there , but presently he came back to it . `` If I was to go , who would look after 'im ? '' He jerked his head toward his master . `` Who would 'e get to serve 'im ? `` `` Someone else , '' I suggested lamely . `` Not 'e . No one would stay a week . If I was to go , that 'ouse would run down like a watch with the mainspring out . I 'm telling you because you 're 'is friend , and you ought to know . If I was to take
