closely built of oak stakes which were thick enough to turn a bullet . Half-way up it was loop-holed in long narrow slits for the fire of the defenders . But on the other hand the trees grew up to within a hundred yards of it , and formed a screen for the attack , while the garrison was so scanty that it could not spare more than twenty men at the utmost for each face . Amos knew how daring and dashing were the Iroquois warriors , how cunning and fertile of resource , and his face darkened as he thought of the young wife who had come so far in their safe-keeping , and of the women and children whom he had seen crowding into the fort . `` Would it not be better if you could send them up the river ? '' he suggested to the seigneur . `` I should very gladly do so , monsieur , and perhaps if we are all alive we may manage it to-night if the weather should be cloudy . But I can not spare the men to guard them , and I can not send them without a guard when we know that Iroquois canoes are on the river and their scouts are swarming on the banks . `` `` You are right . It would be madness . `` `` I have stationed you on this eastern face with your friends and with fifteen men . Monsieur de Catinat , will you command the party ? '' '' Willingly . `` `` I will take the south face as it seems to be the point of danger . Du Lhut can take the north , and five men should be enough to watch the river side . `` `` Have we food and powder ? `` `` I have flour and smoked eels enough to see this matter through . Poor fare , my dear sir , but I daresay you learned in Holland that a cup of ditch water after a brush may have a better smack than the blue-sealed Frontiniac which you helped me to finish the other night . As to powder , we have all our trading stores to draw upon . `` `` We have not time to clear any of these trees ? '' asked the soldier. '' Impossible . They would make better shelter down than up . `` `` But at least I might clear that patch of brushwood round the birch sapling which lies between the east face and the edge of the forest . It is good cover for their skirmishers . `` `` Yes , that should be fired without delay . `` `` Nay , I think that I might do better , '' said Amos . `` We might bait a trap for them there . Where is this powder of which you spoke ? `` `` Theuriet , the major-domo , is giving out powder in the main store-house . `` `` Very good . '' Amos vanished upstairs , and returned with a large linen bag in his hand . This he filled with powder , and then , slinging it over his shoulder , he carried it out to the clump of bushes and placed it at the base of the sapling , cutting a strip out of the bark immediately above the spot . Then with a few leafy branches and fallen leaves he covered the powder bag very carefully over so that it looked like a little hillock of earth . Having arranged all to his satisfaction he returned , clambering over the stockade , and dropping down upon the other side . `` I think that we are all ready for them now , '' said the seigneur . `` I would that the women and children were in a safe place , but we may send them down the river to-night if all goes well . Has anyone heard anything of Du Lhut ? `` `` Jean has the best ears of any of us , your excellency , '' said one man from beside the brass corner cannon . `` He thought that he heard shots a few minutes ago . `` `` Then he has come into touch with them . Etienne , take ten men and go to the withered oak to cover them if they are retreating , but do not go another yard on any pretext . I am too short-handed already . Perhaps , De Catinat , you wish to sleep ? `` `` No , I could not sleep . `` `` We can do no more down here . What do you say to a round or two of piquet ? A little turn of the cards will help us to pass the time . `` They ascended to the upper hall , where Adele came and sat by her husband , while the swarthy Onega crouched by the window looking keenly out into the forest . De Catinat had little thought to spare upon the cards , as his mind wandered to the danger which threatened them and to the woman whose hand rested upon his own . The old nobleman , on the other hand , was engrossed by the play , and cursed under his breath , or chuckled and grinned as the luck swayed one way or the other . Suddenly as they played there came two sharp raps from without . `` Some one is tapping , '' cried Adele . `` It is death that is tapping , '' said the Indian woman at the window . `` Ay , ay , it was the patter of two spent balls against the woodwork.The wind is against our hearing the report . The cards are shuffled.It is my cut and your deal . The capot , I think , was mine . `` `` Men are rushing from the woods , '' cried Onega. '' Tut ! It grows serious ! '' said the nobleman . `` We can finish the game later . Remember that the deal lies with you . Let us see what it all means . `` De Catinat had already rushed to the window . Du Lhut , young Achille de la Noue , and eight of the covering party were running with their heads bent towards the stockade , the door of which had been opened to admit them . Here and there from behind the trees came little blue puffs of smoke , and one of the fugitives who wore white calico breeches began suddenly to hop instead of running and a red splotch showed upon the white cloth . Two others threw their arms round him and the three rushed in abreast while the gate swung into its place behind them . An instant later the brass cannon at the corner gave a flash and a roar while the whole outline of the wood was traced in a rolling cloud , and the shower of bullets rapped up against the wooden wall like sleet on a window.Having left Adele to the care of her Indian hostess , and warned her for her life to keep from the windows , De Catinat seized his musket and rushed downstairs . As he passed a bullet came piping through one of the narrow embrasures and starred itself in a little blotch of lead upon the opposite wall . The seigneur had already descended and was conversing with Du Lhut beside the door . `` A thousand of them , you say ? `` `` Yes , we came on a fresh trail of a large war-party , three hundred at the least . They are all Mohawks and Cayugas with a sprinkling of Oneidas . We had a running fight for a few miles , and we have lost five men . `` `` All dead , I trust . `` `` I hope so , but we were hard pressed to keep from being cut off.Jean Mance is shot through the leg . `` `` I saw that he was hit . `` `` We had best have all ready to retire to the house if they carry the stockade . We can scarce hope to hold it when they are twenty to one . `` `` All is ready . `` `` And with our cannon we can keep their canoes from passing , so we might send our women away to-night . `` `` I had intended to do so . Will you take charge of the north side ? You might come across to me with ten of your men now , and I shall go back to you if they change their attack . `` The firing came in one continuous rattle now from the edges of the wood , and the air was full of bullets . The assailants were all trained shots , men who lived by their guns , and to whom a shaking hand or a dim eye meant poverty and hunger . Every slit and crack and loop-hole was marked , and a cap held above the stockade was blown in an instant from the gun barrel which supported it . On the other hand , the defenders were also skilled in Indian fighting , and wise in every trick and lure which could protect themselves or tempt their enemies to show . They kept well to the sides of the loop-holes , watching through little crevices of the wood , and firing swiftly when a chance offered . A red leg sticking straight up into the air from behind a log showed where one bullet at least had gone home , but there was little to aim at save a puff and flash from among the leaves , or the shadowy figure of a warrior seen for an instant as he darted from one tree-trunk to the other . Seven of the Canadians had already been hit , but only three were mortally wounded , and the other four still kept manfully to their loop-holes , though one who had been struck through the jaw was spitting his teeth with his bullets down into his gun-barrel . The women sat in a line upon the ground , beneath the level of the loop-holes , each with a saucerful of bullets and a canister of powder , passing up the loaded guns to the fighting men at the points where a quick fire was most needful.At first the attack had been all upon the south face , but as fresh bodies of the Iroquois came up their line spread and lengthened until the whole east face was girt with fire , which gradually enveloped the north also . The fort was ringed in by a great loop of smoke , save only where the broad river flowed past them . Over near the further bank the canoes were lurking , and one , manned by ten warriors , attempted to pass up the stream , but a good shot from the brass gun dashed in her side and sank her , while a second of grape left only four of the swimmers whose high scalp-locks stood out above the water like the back-fins of some strange fish . On the inland side , however , the seigneur had ordered the cannon to be served no more , for the broad embrasures drew the enemy 's fire , and of the men who had been struck half were among those who worked the guns.The old nobleman strutted about with his white ruffles and his clouded cane behind the line of parched smoke-grimed men , tapping his snuff-box , shooting out his little jests , and looking very much less concerned than he had done over his piquet . `` What
