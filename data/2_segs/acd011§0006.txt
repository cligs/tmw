What about him ? Is he reliable ? `` `` Ten years with Sir Charles Chandos -- -as solid as a rock . He has been with Douglas ever since he took the Manor House five years ago . He has never seen a gun of this sort in the house . `` `` The gun was made to conceal . That 's why the barrels were sawed . It would fit into any box . How could he swear there was no such gun in the house ? `` `` Well , anyhow , he had never seen one . `` MacDonald shook his obstinate Scotch head . `` I 'm not convinced yet that there was ever anyone in the house , '' said he . `` I 'm asking you to conseedar '' ( his accent became more Aberdonian as he lost himself in his argument ) `` I 'm asking you to conseedar what it involves if you suppose that this gun was ever brought into the house , and that all these strange things were done by a person from outside . Oh , man , it 's just inconceivable ! It 's clean against common sense ! I put it to you , Mr. Holmes , judging it by what we have heard . `` `` Well , state your case , Mr. Mac , '' said Holmes in his most judicial style . `` The man is not a burglar , supposing that he ever existed . The ring business and the card point to premeditated murder for some private reason . Very good . Here is a man who slips into a house with the deliberate intention of committing murder . He knows , if he knows anything , that he will have a deeficulty in making his escape , as the house is surrounded with water . What weapon would he choose ? You would say the most silent in the world . Then he could hope when the deed was done to slip quickly from the window , to wade the moat , and to get away at his leisure . That 's understandable . But is it understandable that he should go out of his way to bring with him the most noisy weapon he could select , knowing well that it will fetch every human being in the house to the spot as quick as they can run , and that it is all odds that he will be seen before he can get across the moat ? Is that credible , Mr . Holmes ? `` `` Well , you put the case strongly , '' my friend replied thoughtfully . `` It certainly needs a good deal of justification . May I ask , Mr. White Mason , whether you examined the farther side of the moat at once to see if there were any signs of the man having climbed out from the water ? `` `` There were no signs , Mr. Holmes . But it is a stone ledge , and one could hardly expect them . `` `` No tracks or marks ? '' '' None. '' '' Ha ! Would there be any objection , Mr. White Mason , to our going down to the house at once ? There may possibly be some small point which might be suggestive . `` `` I was going to propose it , Mr. Holmes ; but I thought it well to put you in touch with all the facts before we go . I suppose if anything should strike you -- - '' White Mason looked doubtfully at the amateur . `` I have worked with Mr. Holmes before , '' said Inspector MacDonald . `` He plays the game . `` `` My own idea of the game , at any rate , '' said Holmes , with a smile . `` I go into a case to help the ends of justice and the work of the police . If I have ever separated myself from the official force , it is because they have first separated themselves from me . I have no wish ever to score at their expense . At the same time , Mr. White Mason , I claim the right to work in my own way and give my results at my own time -- -complete rather than in stages . `` `` I am sure we are honoured by your presence and to show you all we know , '' said White Mason cordially . `` Come along , Dr. Watson , and when the time comes we 'll all hope for a place in your book . `` We walked down the quaint village street with a row of pollarded elms on each side of it . Just beyond were two ancient stone pillars , weather-stained and lichen-blotched , bearing upon their summits a shapeless something which had once been the rampant lion of Capus of Birlstone . A short walk along the winding drive with such sward and oaks around it as one only sees in rural England , then a sudden turn , and the long , low Jacobean house of dingy , liver-coloured brick lay before us , with an old-fashioned garden of cut yews on each side of it . As we approached it , there was the wooden drawbridge and the beautiful broad moat as still and luminous as quicksilver in the cold , winter sunshine.Three centuries had flowed past the old Manor House , centuries of births and of homecomings , of country dances and of the meetings of fox hunters . Strange that now in its old age this dark business should have cast its shadow upon the venerable walls ! And yet those strange , peaked roofs and quaint , overhung gables were a fitting covering to grim and terrible intrigue . As I looked at the deep-set windows and the long sweep of the dull-coloured , water-lapped front , I felt that no more fitting scene could be set for such a tragedy . `` That 's the window , '' said White Mason , `` that one on the immediate right of the drawbridge . It 's open just as it was found last night . `` `` It looks rather narrow for a man to pass . `` `` Well , it was n't a fat man , anyhow . We do n't need your deductions , Mr. Holmes , to tell us that . But you or I could squeeze through all right . `` Holmes walked to the edge of the moat and looked across . Then he examined the stone ledge and the grass border beyond it . `` I 've had a good look , Mr. Holmes , '' said White Mason . `` There is nothing there , no sign that anyone has landed -- -but why should he leave any sign ? '' '' Exactly . Why should he ? Is the water always turbid ? `` `` Generally about this colour . The stream brings down the clay . `` `` How deep is it ? `` `` About two feet at each side and three in the middle . `` `` So we can put aside all idea of the man having been drowned in crossing . `` `` No , a child could not be drowned in it . `` We walked across the drawbridge , and were admitted by a quaint , gnarled , dried-up person , who was the butler , Ames . The poor old fellow was white and quivering from the shock . The village sergeant , a tall , formal , melancholy man , still held his vigil in the room of Fate . The doctor had departed . `` Anything fresh , Sergeant Wilson ? '' asked White Mason . `` No , sir . `` `` Then you can go home . You 've had enough . We can send for you if we want you . The butler had better wait outside . Tell him to warn Mr. Cecil Barker , Mrs. Douglas , and the housekeeper that we may want a word with them presently . Now , gentlemen , perhaps you will allow me to give you the views I have formed first , and then you will be able to arrive at your own . `` He impressed me , this country specialist . He had a solid grip of fact and a cool , clear , common-sense brain , which should take him some way in his profession . Holmes listened to him intently , with no sign of that impatience which the official exponent too often produced . `` Is it suicide , or is it murder -- -that 's our first question , gentlemen , is it not ? If it were suicide , then we have to believe that this man began by taking off his wedding ring and concealing it ; that he then came down here in his dressing gown , trampled mud into a corner behind the curtain in order to give the idea someone had waited for him , opened the window , put blood on the -- - '' '' We can surely dismiss that , '' said MacDonald . `` So I think . Suicide is out of the question . Then a murder has been done . What we have to determine is , whether it was done by someone outside or inside the house . `` `` Well , let 's hear the argument . `` `` There are considerable difficulties both ways , and yet one or the other it must be . We will suppose first that some person or persons inside the house did the crime . They got this man down here at a time when everything was still and yet no one was asleep . They then did the deed with the queerest and noisiest weapon in the world so as to tell everyone what had happened -- -a weapon that was never seen in the house before . That does not seem a very likely start , does it ? `` `` No , it does not . `` `` Well , then , everyone is agreed that after the alarm was given only a minute at the most had passed before the whole household -- -not Mr. Cecil Barker alone , though he claims to have been the first , but Ames and all of them were on the spot . Do you tell me that in that time the guilty person managed to make footmarks in the corner , open the window , mark the sill with blood , take the wedding ring off the dead man 's finger , and all the rest of it ? It 's impossible ! `` `` You put it very clearly , '' said Holmes . `` I am inclined to agree with you . `` `` Well , then , we are driven back to the theory that it was done by someone from outside . We are still faced with some big difficulties ; but anyhow they have ceased to be impossibilities . The man got into the house between four-thirty and six ; that is to say , between dusk and the time when the bridge was raised . There had been some visitors , and the door was open ; so there was nothing to prevent him . He may have been a common burglar , or he may have had some private grudge against Mr. Douglas . Since Mr. Douglas has spent most of his life in America , and this shotgun seems to be an American weapon , it would seem that the private grudge is the more likely theory
