to be got out of him now , '' the old man would say . `` When a man 's in love he 's not over fond of a ledger . `` `` A nice-looking girl , too , '' said Ezra , in answer to some such remark . `` I thought something would come of it . We saw them together at the opera , did n't we , Kate ? `` So they would gossip together , and every word a stab to the poor girl . She strove to conceal her feelings , and , indeed , her anger and her pride were stronger even than her grief , for she felt that she had been cruelly used . One day she found Girdlestone alone and unbosomed herself to him . `` Is it really true , '' she asked , with a quick pant and a catch of her breath , `` that Mr. Dimsdale is engaged to be married ? `` `` I believe so , my dear , '' her guardian answered . `` It is commonly reported so . When a young lady and gentleman correspond it is usually a sign of something of the sort . `` `` Oh , they correspond ? `` `` Yes , they certainly correspond . Her letters are sent to him at the office . I do n't know that I altogether like that arrangement . It looks as if he were deceiving his parents . '' All this was an unmitigated lie , but Girdlestone had gone too far now to stick at trifles . `` Who is the lady ? '' asked Kate , with a calm set face but a quivering lip . `` A cousin of his . Miss Ossary is her name , I believe . I am not sorry , for it may be a sign that he has sown all his wild oats . Do you know at one time , Kate , I feared that he might take a fancy to you . He has a specious way with him , and I felt my responsibility in the matter . `` `` You need not be afraid on that score , '' Kate said bitterly . `` I think I can gauge Mr. Dimsdale 's specious manner at its proper value . '' With this valiant speech she marched off , head in air , to her room , and there wept as though her very heart would break.John Girdlestone told his son of this scene as they walked home from Fenchurch Street that same day . `` We must look sharp over it , '' he said , `` or that young fool may get impatient and upset our plans . `` `` It 's not such an easy matter , '' said his son gloomily . `` I get along so far , but no further . It 's a more uphill job than I expected . `` `` Why , you had a bad enough name among women , '' the merchant said , with something approaching to a sneer . `` I have been grieved times out of number by your looseness in that respect . I should have thought that you might have made your experience of some use now . `` `` There are women and women , '' his son remarked . `` A girl like this takes as much managing as a skittish horse . `` `` Once get her into harness , and I warrant you 'll keep her there quiet enough . `` `` You bet , '' said Ezra , with a loud laugh . `` But at present she has the pull . Her mind is still running on that fellow . `` `` She spoke bitterly enough of him this morning . `` `` So she might , but she thinks of him none the less . If I could once make her thoroughly realize that he had thrown her over I might catch her on the hop . She 'd marry for spite if she would n't for love . `` `` Just so ; just so . Wait a bit . That can be managed , I think , if you will leave it to me . `` The old man brooded over the problem all day , for from week to week the necessity for the money was becoming more pressing , and that money could only be hoped for through the success of Ezra 's wooing . No wonder that every little detail which might sway the balance one way or the other was anxiously pondered over by the head of the firm , and that even the fluctuations in oil and ivory became secondary to this great object.Next day , immediately after they had sat down to dinner , some letters were handed in by the footman . `` Forwarded on from the office , sir , '' said the flunkey . `` The clerk says that Mr. Gilray was away and that he did not like to open them . `` `` Just like him ! '' said Girdlestone , peevishly pushing back his plate of soup . `` I hate doing business out of hours . '' He tore the envelopes off the various letters as he spoke . `` What 's this ? Casks returned as per invoice ; that 's all right . Note from Rudder & Saxe -- -that can be answered to-morrow . Memorandum on the Custom duties at Sierra Leone . Hallo ! what have we here ? 'My darling Tom ' -- -who is this from -- -Yours ever , Mary Ossary . ' Why , it 's one of young Dimsdale 's love-letters which has got mixed up with my business papers . Ha ! ha ! I must really apologize to him for having opened it , but he must take his chance of that , if he has his correspondence sent to the office . I take it for granted that everything there is a business communication . `` Kate 's face grew very white as she listened . She ate little dinner that day , poor child , and took the earliest opportunity of retiring to her room . `` You did that uncommonly well , dad , '' said Ezra approvingly , after she was gone . `` It hit her hard , I could see that . `` `` I think it touched her pride . People should not have pride . We are warned against it . Now , that same pride of hers will forbid her ever thinking of that young man again . `` `` And you had the letter written ? `` `` I wrote it myself . I think , in such a case , any stratagem is justifiable . Such large interests are at stake that we must adopt strong measures . I quite agree with the old Churchmen that the end occasionally justifies the means . `` `` Capital , dad ; very good ! '' cried Ezra , chewing his toothpick . `` I like to hear you argue . It 's quite refreshing . `` `` I act according to the lights which are vouchsafed me , '' said John Girdlestone gravely ; on which Ezra leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.The very next morning the merchant spoke to Dimsdale on the matter , for he had observed signs of impatience in the young man , and feared that some sudden impulse might lead him to break his promise and so upset everything . `` Take a seat . I should like to have a word with you , '' he said graciously , when his junior partner appeared before him to consult with him as to the duties of the day . Tom sat down with hope in his heart . `` It is only fair to you , Mr. Dimsdale , '' Girdlestone said , in a kindly voice , `` that I should express to you my appreciation of your honourable conduct . You have kept your promise in regard to Miss Harston in the fullest manner . `` `` Of course I kept my promise , '' said Tom bluntly . `` I trust , however , that you will soon see your way to withdrawing your prohibition . It has been a hard trial to me . `` `` I have insisted upon it because it seemed to me to be my duty . Every one takes his own view upon such points , and it has always been my custom throughout life to take what some might think a stringent one . It appears to me that I owe it to my deceased friend to prevent his daughter , whom he has confided to me , from making any mistake . As I said before , if you continue to show that you are worthy of her , I may think more favourably of it . Exemplary as your conduct has been since you joined us , I believe that I am not wrong in stating that you were a little wild when you were at Edinburgh . `` `` I never did anything that I am ashamed of , '' said Tom . `` Very likely not , '' Girdlestone answered , with an irrepressible sneer . `` The question is , did you do anything that your father was ashamed of ? `` `` Certainly not , '' cried Tom hotly . `` I was no milksop or psalm singer , but there is nothing that I ever did there of which I should be ashamed of my father knowing . `` `` Do n't speak lightly of psalm singing . It is a good practice in its way , and you would have been none the worse had you indulged in it perhaps . However , that is neither here nor there . What I want you clearly to understand is that my ultimate consent to your union depends entirely upon your own conduct . Above all , I insist that you refrain from unsettling the girl 's mind at present . `` `` I have already promised . Hard as the struggle may be , I shall not break my word . I have the consolation of knowing that if we were separated for twenty years we should still be true to one another . `` `` That 's very satisfactory , '' said the merchant grimly . `` Nevertheless it is a weary , weary time . If I could only write a line -- - '' '' Not a word , '' Girdlestone interrupted . `` It is only because I trust you that I keep her in London at all . If I thought there was a possibility of your doing such a thing I should remove her at once . `` `` I shall do nothing without your permission , '' Tom said , taking up his hat to go . He paused with his hand upon the door . `` If ever it seems good to me , '' he said , `` I consider that by giving you due notice I absolve myself from my promise . `` `` You would not do anything so foolish . `` `` Still I reserve myself the right of doing so , '' said Tom , and went off with a heavy heart to his day 's work . `` Everything is clear for you now , '' the old man said to his son triumphantly . `` There 's no chance of interference , and the girl is in the very humour to be won . I flatter myself that it has been managed with tact . Remember that all
