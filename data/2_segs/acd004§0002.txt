to their labors and withdrew himself to his own private chamber , there to seek spiritual aid in the discharge of the duties of his high office.The Abbot was still on his knees , when a gentle tapping at the door of his cell broke in upon his orisons.Rising in no very good humor at the interruption , he gave the word to enter ; but his look of impatience softened down into a pleasant and paternal smile as his eyes fell upon his visitor.He was a thin-faced , yellow-haired youth , rather above the middle size , comely and well shapen , with straight , lithe figure and eager , boyish features . His clear , pensive gray eyes , and quick , delicate expression , spoke of a nature which had unfolded far from the boisterous joys and sorrows of the world . Yet there was a set of the mouth and a prominence of the chin which relieved him of any trace of effeminacy . Impulsive he might be , enthusiastic , sensitive , with something sympathetic and adaptive in his disposition ; but an observer of nature 's tokens would have confidently pledged himself that there was native firmness and strength underlying his gentle , monk-bred ways.The youth was not clad in monastic garb , but in lay attire , though his jerkin , cloak and hose were all of a sombre hue , as befitted one who dwelt in sacred precincts . A broad leather strap hanging from his shoulder supported a scrip or satchel such as travellers were wont to carry . In one hand he grasped a thick staff pointed and shod with metal , while in the other he held his coif or bonnet , which bore in its front a broad pewter medal stamped with the image of Our Lady of Rocamadour . `` Art ready , then , fair son ? '' said the Abbot . `` This is indeed a day of comings and of goings . It is strange that in one twelve hours the Abbey should have cast off its foulest weed and should now lose what we are fain to look upon as our choicest blossom . `` `` You speak too kindly , father , '' the youth answered . `` If I had my will I should never go forth , but should end my days here in Beaulieu . It hath been my home as far back as my mind can carry me , and it is a sore thing for me to have to leave it . `` `` Life brings many a cross , '' said the Abbot gently . `` Who is without them ? Your going forth is a grief to us as well as to yourself . But there is no help . I had given my foreword and sacred promise to your father , Edric the Franklin , that at the age of twenty you should be sent out into the world to see for yourself how you liked the savor of it . Seat thee upon the settle , Alleyne , for you may need rest ere long . `` The youth sat down as directed , but reluctantly and with diffidence . The Abbot stood by the narrow window , and his long black shadow fell slantwise across the rush-strewn floor . `` Twenty years ago , '' he said , `` your father , the Franklin of Minstead , died , leaving to the Abbey three hides of rich land in the hundred of Malwood , and leaving to us also his infant son on condition that we should rear him until he came to man 's estate . This he did partly because your mother was dead , and partly because your elder brother , now Socman of Minstead , had already given sign of that fierce and rude nature which would make him no fit companion for you . It was his desire and request , however , that you should not remain in the cloisters , but should at a ripe age return into the world . `` `` But , father , '' interrupted the young man , `` it is surely true that I am already advanced several degrees in clerkship ? `` `` Yes , fair son , but not so far as to bar you from the garb you now wear or the life which you must now lead . You have been porter ? `` `` Yes , father. '' '' Exorcist ? `` `` Yes , father. '' '' Reader ? `` `` Yes , father. '' '' Acolyte ? `` `` Yes , father . `` `` But have sworn no vow of constancy or chastity ? `` `` No , father . `` `` Then you are free to follow a worldly life . But let me hear , ere you start , what gifts you take away with you from Beaulieu ? Some I already know . There is the playing of the citole and the rebeck . Our choir will be dumb without you . You carve too ? `` The youth 's pale face flushed with the pride of the skilled workman . `` Yes , holy father , '' he answered . `` Thanks to good brother Bartholomew , I carve in wood and in ivory , and can do something also in silver and in bronze . From brother Francis I have learned to paint on vellum , on glass , and on metal , with a knowledge of those pigments and essences which can preserve the color against damp or a biting air . Brother Luke hath given me some skill in damask work , and in the enamelling of shrines , tabernacles , diptychs and triptychs . For the rest , I know a little of the making of covers , the cutting of precious stones , and the fashioning of instruments . `` `` A goodly list , truly , '' cried the superior with a smile . `` What clerk of Cambrig or of Oxenford could say as much ? But of thy reading -- -hast not so much to show there , I fear ? `` `` No , father , it hath been slight enough . Yet , thanks to our good chancellor , I am not wholly unlettered . I have read Ockham , Bradwardine , and other of the schoolmen , together with the learned Duns Scotus and the book of the holy Aquinas . `` `` But of the things of this world , what have you gathered from your reading ? From this high window you may catch a glimpse over the wooden point and the smoke of Bucklershard of the mouth of the Exe , and the shining sea . Now , I pray you , Alleyne , if a man were to take a ship and spread sail across yonder waters , where might he hope to arrive ? `` The youth pondered , and drew a plan amongst the rushes with the point of his staff . `` Holy father , '' said he , `` he would come upon those parts of France which are held by the King 's Majesty . But if he trended to the south he might reach Spain and the Barbary States . To his north would be Flanders and the country of the Eastlanders and of the Muscovites. '' '' True . And how if , after reaching the King 's possessions , he still journeyed on to the eastward ? `` `` He would then come upon that part of France which is still in dispute , and he might hope to reach the famous city of Avignon , where dwells our blessed father , the prop of Christendom . `` `` And then ? `` `` Then he would pass through the land of the Almains and the great Roman Empire , and so to the country of the Huns and of the Lithuanian pagans , beyond which lies the great city of Constantine and the kingdom of the unclean followers of Mahmoud . `` `` And beyond that , fair son ? `` `` Beyond that is Jerusalem and the Holy Land , and the great river which hath its source in the Garden of Eden . `` `` And then ? `` `` Nay , good father , I can not tell . Methinks the end of the world is not far from there . `` `` Then we can still find something to teach thee , Alleyne , '' said the Abbot complaisantly . `` Know that many strange nations lie betwixt there and the end of the world . There is the country of the Amazons , and the country of the dwarfs , and the country of the fair but evil women who slay with beholding , like the basilisk . Beyond that again is the kingdom of Prester John and of the great Cham . These things I know for very sooth , for I had them from that pious Christian and valiant knight , Sir John de Mandeville , who stopped twice at Beaulieu on his way to and from Southampton , and discoursed to us concerning what he had seen from the reader 's desk in the refectory , until there was many a good brother who got neither bit nor sup , so stricken were they by his strange tales . `` `` I would fain know , father , '' asked the young man , `` what there may be at the end of the world ? `` `` There are some things , '' replied the Abbot gravely , `` into which it was never intended that we should inquire . But you have a long road before you . Whither will you first turn ? `` `` To my brother 's at Minstead . If he be indeed an ungodly and violent man , there is the more need that I should seek him out and see whether I can not turn him to better ways . `` The Abbot shook his head . `` The Socman of Minstead hath earned an evil name over the country side , '' he said . `` If you must go to him , see at least that he doth not turn you from the narrow path upon which you have learned to tread . But you are in God 's keeping , and Godward should you ever look in danger and in trouble . Above all , shun the snares of women , for they are ever set for the foolish feet of the young . Kneel down , my child , and take an old man 's blessing . `` Alleyne Edricson bent his head while the Abbot poured out his heartfelt supplication that Heaven would watch over this young soul , now going forth into the darkness and danger of the world . It was no mere form for either of them . To them the outside life of mankind did indeed seem to be one of violence and of sin , beset with physical and still more with spiritual danger . Heaven , too , was very near to them in those days . God 's direct agency was to be seen in the thunder and the rainbow , the whirlwind and the lightning . To the believer , clouds of angels and confessors , and martyrs , armies of the sainted and the saved , were ever stooping over their struggling brethren upon earth , raising , encouraging , and supporting them . It was then with a lighter heart and a stouter courage that the young man turned from the Abbot 's room , while the latter , following him to
