archers had passed a curve in the road , though Alleyne could still hear the heavy clump , clump of their marching , or catch a glimpse of the sparkle of steel through the tangle of leafless branches . `` Ride by my side , friends , I entreat of you , '' said the knight , reining in his steed that they might come abreast of him . `` For , since it hath pleased you to follow me to the wars , it were well that you should know how you may best serve me . I doubt not , Terlake , that you will show yourself a worthy son of a valiant father ; and you , Ford , of yours ; and you , Edricson , that you are mindful of the old-time house from which all men know that you are sprung . And first I would have you bear very steadfastly in mind that our setting forth is by no means for the purpose of gaining spoil or exacting ransom , though it may well happen that such may come to us also . We go to France , and from thence I trust to Spain , in humble search of a field in which we may win advancement and perchance some small share of glory . For this purpose I would have you know that it is not my wont to let any occasion pass where it is in any way possible that honor may be gained . I would have you bear this in mind , and give great heed to it that you may bring me word of all cartels , challenges , wrongs , tyrannies , infamies , and wronging of damsels . Nor is any occasion too small to take note of , for I have known such trifles as the dropping of a gauntlet , or the flicking of a breadcrumb , when well and properly followed up , lead to a most noble spear-running . But , Edricson , do I not see a cavalier who rides down yonder road amongst the nether shaw ? It would be well , perchance , that you should give him greeting from me . And , should he be of gentle blood it may be that he would care to exchange thrusts with me . `` `` Why , my lord , '' quoth Ford , standing in his stirrups and shading his eyes , `` it is old Hob Davidson , the fat miller of Milton ! `` `` Ah , so it is , indeed , '' said Sir Nigel , puckering his cheeks ; `` but wayside ventures are not to be scorned , for I have seen no finer passages than are to be had from such chance meetings , when cavaliers are willing to advance themselves . I can well remember that two leagues from the town of Rheims I met a very valiant and courteous cavalier of France , with whom I had gentle and most honorable contention for upwards of an hour . It hath ever grieved me that I had not his name , for he smote upon me with a mace and went upon his way ere I was in condition to have much speech with him ; but his arms were an allurion in chief above a fess azure . I was also on such an occasion thrust through the shoulder by Lyon de Montcourt , whom I met on the high road betwixt Libourne and Bordeaux . I met him but the once , but I have never seen a man for whom I bear a greater love and esteem . And so also with the squire Le Bourg Capillet , who would have been a very valiant captain had he lived . `` `` He is dead then ? '' asked Alleyne Edricson. '' Alas ! it was my ill fate to slay him in a bickering which broke out in a field near the township of Tarbes . I can not call to mind how the thing came about , for it was in the year of the Prince 's ride through Languedoc , when there was much fine skirmishing to be had at barriers . By St. Paul ! I do not think that any honorable cavalier could ask for better chance of advancement than might be had by spurring forth before the army and riding to the gateways of Narbonne , or Bergerac or Mont Giscar , where some courteous gentleman would ever be at wait to do what he might to meet your wish or ease you of your vow . Such a one at Ventadour ran three courses with me betwixt daybreak and sunrise , to the great exaltation of his lady . `` `` And did you slay him also , my lord ? '' asked Ford with reverence . `` I could never learn , for he was carried within the barrier , and as I had chanced to break the bone of my leg it was a great unease for me to ride or even to stand . Yet , by the goodness of heaven and the pious intercession of the valiant St. George , I was able to sit my charger in the ruffle of Poictiers , which was no very long time afterwards . But what have we here ? A very fair and courtly maiden , or I mistake . `` It was indeed a tall and buxom country lass , with a basket of spinach-leaves upon her head , and a great slab of bacon tucked under one arm . She bobbed a frightened curtsey as Sir Nigel swept his velvet hat from his head and reined up his great charger . `` God be with thee , fair maiden ! '' said he . `` God guard thee , my lord ! '' she answered , speaking in the broadest West Saxon speech , and balancing herself first on one foot and then on the other in her bashfulness . `` Fear not , my fair damsel , '' said Sir Nigel , `` but tell me if perchance a poor and most unworthy knight can in any wise be of service to you . Should it chance that you have been used despitefully , it may be that I may obtain justice for you . `` `` Lawk no , kind sir , '' she answered , clutching her bacon the tighter , as though some design upon it might be hid under this knightly offer . `` I be the milking wench o ' fairmer Arnold , and he be as kind a maister as heart could wish . `` `` It is well , '' said he , and with a shake of the bridle rode on down the woodland path . `` I would have you bear in mind , '' he continued to his squires , `` that gentle courtesy is not , as is the base use of so many false knights , to be shown only to maidens of high degree , for there is no woman so humble that a true knight may not listen to her tale of wrong . But here comes a cavalier who is indeed in haste . Perchance it would be well that we should ask him whither he rides , for it may be that he is one who desires to advance himself in chivalry . `` The bleak , hard , wind-swept road dipped down in front of them into a little valley , and then , writhing up the heathy slope upon the other side , lost itself among the gaunt pine-trees . Far away between the black lines of trunks the quick glitter of steel marked where the Company pursued its way . To the north stretched the tree country , but to the south , between two swelling downs , a glimpse might be caught of the cold gray shimmer of the sea , with the white fleck of a galley sail upon the distant sky-line . Just in front of the travellers a horseman was urging his steed up the slope , driving it on with whip and spur as one who rides for a set purpose . As he clattered up , Alleyne could see that the roan horse was gray with dust and flecked with foam , as though it had left many a mile behind it . The rider was a stern-faced man , hard of mouth and dry of eye , with a heavy sword clanking at his side , and a stiff white bundle swathed in linen balanced across the pommel of his saddle . `` The king 's messenger , '' he bawled as he came up to them . `` The messenger of the king . Clear the causeway for the king 's own man . `` `` Not so loudly , friend , '' quoth the little knight , reining his horse half round to bar the path . `` I have myself been the king 's man for thirty years or more , but I have not been wont to halloo about it on a peaceful highway . `` `` I ride in his service , '' cried the other , `` and I carry that which belongs to him . You bar my path at your peril . `` `` Yet I have known the king 's enemies claim to ride in his same , '' said Sir Nigel . `` The foul fiend may lurk beneath a garment of light . We must have some sign or warrant of your mission . `` `` Then must I hew a passage , '' cried the stranger , with his shoulder braced round and his hand upon his hilt . `` I am not to be stopped on the king 's service by every gadabout . `` `` Should you be a gentleman of quarterings and coat-armor , '' lisped Sir Nigel , `` I shall be very blithe to go further into the matter with you . If not , I have three very worthy squires , any one of whom would take the thing upon himself , and debate it with you in a very honorable way . `` The man scowled from one to the other , and his hand stole away from his sword . `` You ask me for a sign , '' he said . `` Here is a sign for you , since you must have one . '' As he spoke he whirled the covering from the object in front of him and showed to their horror that it was a newly-severed human leg . `` By God 's tooth ! '' he continued , with a brutal laugh , `` you ask me if I am a man of quarterings , and it is even so , for I am officer to the verderer 's court at Lyndhurst . This thievish leg is to hang at Milton , and the other is already at Brockenhurst , as a sign to all men of what comes of being over-fond of venison pasty. '' '' Faugh ! '' cried Sir Nigel . `` Pass on the other side of the road , fellow , and let us have the wind of you . We shall trot our horses , my friends , across this pleasant valley , for , by Our Lady ! a breath of God 's fresh air is right welcome after such a sight . `` `` We hoped to snare a falcon , '' said he presently , `` but we netted a carrion-crow . Ma foi ! but there are men whose hearts are tougher than a boar 's hide . For me , I
