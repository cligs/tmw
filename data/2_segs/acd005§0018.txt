I had intended to rebuke the conduct of a presumptuous person . But perhaps it is better as it is . My absence will in itself convey my message , and in such a sort that I trust I may never see that person 's face more at my court . But , ah , what is this ? `` The door had been flung open , and Madame de Montespan , beautiful and furious , was standing before them.Madame de Maintenon was a woman who was always full of self-restraint and of cool resource . She had risen in an instant , with an air as if she had at last seen the welcome guest for whom she had pined in vain . With a frank smile of greeting , she advanced with outstretched hand . `` This is indeed a pleasure , '' said she.But Madame de Montespan was very angry , so angry that she was evidently making strong efforts to keep herself within control , and to avoid breaking into a furious outburst . Her face was very pale , her lips compressed , and her blue eyes had the set stare and the cold glitter of a furious woman . So for an instant they faced each other , the one frowning , the other smiling , two of the most beautiful and queenly women in France . Then De Montespan , disregarding her rival 's outstretched hand , turned towards the king , who had been looking at her with a darkening face . `` I fear that I intrude , sire . `` `` Your entrance , madame , is certainly somewhat abrupt . `` `` I must crave pardon if it is so . Since this lady has been the governess of my children I have been in the habit of coming into her room unannounced . `` `` As far as I am concerned , you are most welcome to do so , '' said her rival , with perfect composure . `` I confess that I had not even thought it necessary to ask your permission , madame , '' the other answered coldly . `` Then you shall certainly do so in the future , madame , '' said the king sternly . `` It is my express order to you that every possible respect is to be shown in every way to this lady . `` `` Oh , tothislady ! '' with a wave of her hand in her direction . `` Your Majesty 's commands are of course our laws . But I must remember that it *is* this lady , for sometimes one may get confused as to which name it is that your Majesty has picked out for honour . To-day it is De Maintenon ; yesterday it was Fontanges ; to-morrow -- -Ah , well , who can say who it may be to-morrow ? `` She was superb in her pride and her fearlessness as she stood , with her sparkling blue eyes and her heaving bosom , looking down upon her royal lover . Angry as he was , his gaze lost something of its sternness as it rested upon her round full throat and the delicate lines of her shapely shoulders . There was something very becoming in her passion , in the defiant pose of her dainty head , and the magnificent scorn with which she glanced at her rival . `` There is nothing to be gained , madame , by being insolent , '' said he . `` Nor is it my custom , sire . `` `` And yet I find your words so . `` `` Truth is always mistaken for insolence , sire , at the court of France . `` `` We have had enough of this . `` `` A very little truth is enough . `` `` You forget yourself , madame . I beg that you will leave the room . `` `` I must first remind your Majesty that I was so far honoured as to have an appointment this afternoon . At four o'clock I had your royal promise that you would come to me . I can not doubt that your Majesty will keep that promise in spite of the fascinations which you may find here . `` `` I should have come , madame , but the clock , as you may observe , is half an hour slow , and the time had passed before I was aware of it . `` I beg , sire , that you will not let that distress you . I am returning to my chamber , and five o'clock will suit me as well as four . `` `` I thank you , madame , but I have not found this interview so pleasant that I should seek another . `` `` Then your Majesty will not come ? `` `` I should prefer not . `` `` In spite of your promise ! '' '' Madame ! `` `` You will break your word ! `` `` Silence , madame ; this is intolerable . `` `` It is indeed intolerable ! '' cried the angry lady , throwing all discretion to the winds . `` Oh , I am not afraid of you , sire . I have loved you , but I have never feared you . I leave you here . I leave you with your conscience and your -- -your lady confessor . But one word of truth you shall hear before I go . You have been false to your wife , and you have been false to your mistress , but it is only now that I find that you can be false also to your word . '' She swept him an indignant courtesy , and glided , with head erect , out of the room.The king sprang from his chair as if he had been stung . Accustomed as he was to his gentle little wife , and the even gentler La Valliere , such language as this had never before intruded itself upon the royal ears . It was like a physical blow to him . He felt stunned , humiliated , bewildered , by so unwonted a sensation . What odour was this which mingled for the first time with the incense amid which he lived ? And then his whole soul rose up in anger at her , at the woman who had dared to raise her voice against him . That she should be jealous of and insult another woman , that was excusable . It was , in fact , an indirect compliment to himself . But that she should turn upon him , as if they were merely man and woman , instead of monarch and subject , that was too much . He gave an inarticulate cry of rage , and rushed to the door. '' Sire ! '' Madame de Maintenon , who had watched keenly the swift play of his emotions over his expressive face , took two quick steps forward , and laid her hand upon his arm . `` I will go after her . `` `` And why , sire ? `` To forbid her the court . `` `` But , sire -- - '' '' You heard her ! It is infamous ! I shall go . `` `` But , sire , could you not write ? `` `` No , no ; I shall see her . '' He pulled open the door . `` Oh , sire , be firm , then ! '' It was with an anxious face that she watched him start off , walking rapidly , with angry gestures , down the corridor . Then she turned back , and dropping upon her knees on theprie-dieu , bowed her head in prayer for the king , for herself , and for France.De Catinat , the guardsman , had employed himself in showing his young friend from over the water all the wonders of the great palace , which the other had examined keenly , and had criticised or admired with an independence of judgment and a native correctness of taste natural to a man whose life had been spent in freedom amid the noblest works of nature . Grand as were the mighty fountains and the artificial cascades , they had no overwhelming effect on one who had travelled up from Erie to Ontario , and had seen the Niagara River hurl itself over its precipice , nor were the long level swards so very large to eyes which had rested upon the great plains of the Dakotas . The building itself , however , its extent , its height , and the beauty of its stone , filled him with astonishment . `` I must bring Ephraim Savage here , '' he kept repeating . `` He Would never believe else that there was one house in the world which would weigh more than all Boston and New York put together . `` De Catinat had arranged that the American should remain with his friend Major de Brissac , as the time had come round for his own second turn of guard . He had hardly stationed himself in the corridor when he was astonished to see the King , without escort or attendants , walking swiftly down the passage . His delicate face was disfigured with anger , and his mouth was set grimly , like that of a man who had taken a momentous resolution . `` Officer of the guard , '' said he shortly . `` Yes , sire. '' '' What ! You again , Captain de Catinat ? You have not been on duty since morning ? `` `` No , sire . It is my second guard . `` `` Very good . I wish your assistance . `` `` I am at your command , sire . `` `` Is there a subaltern here ? `` `` Lieutenant de la Tremouille is at the side guard . `` `` Very well . You will place him in command . `` `` Yes , sire . `` `` You will yourself go to Monsieur de Vivonne . You know his apartments ? `` `` Yes , sire . `` `` If he is not there , you must go and seek him . Wherever he is , you must find him within the hour . `` `` Yes , sire . `` `` You will give him an order from me . At six o'clock he is to be in his carriage at the east gate of the palace . His sister , Madame de Montespan , will await him there , and he is charged by me to drive her to the Chateau of Petit Bourg . You will tell him that he is answerable to me for her arrival there . `` `` Yes , sire . '' De Catinat raised his sword in salute , and started upon his mission.The king passed on down the corridor , and opened a door which led him into a magnificent ante-room , all one blaze of mirrors and gold , furnished to a marvel with the most delicate ebony and silver suite , on a deep red carpet of Aleppo , as soft and yielding as the moss of a forest . In keeping with the furniture was the sole occupant of this stately chamber -- -a little negro boy in a livery of velvet picked out with silver tinsel , who stood as motionless as a small swart statuette against the door which faced that through which the king entered . `` Is your mistress there ? `` `` She has just returned , sire . `` `` I
