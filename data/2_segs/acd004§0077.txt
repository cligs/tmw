'Christopher , ' which the French had taken from us , was moored two hundred paces from the shore , two archers , little Robin Withstaff and Elias Baddlesmere , in four shots each cut every strand of her hempen anchor-cord , so that she well-nigh came upon the rocks . `` `` Good shooting , i ' faith rare shooting ! '' said Black Simon . `` But I have seen you , Johnston , and you , Samkin Aylward , and one or two others who are still with us , shoot as well as the best . Was it not you , Johnston , who took the fat ox at Finsbury butts against the pick of London town ? `` A sunburnt and black-eyed Brabanter had stood near the old archers , leaning upon a large crossbow and listening to their talk , which had been carried on in that hybrid camp dialect which both nations could understand . He was a squat , bull-necked man , clad in the iron helmet , mail tunic , and woollen gambesson of his class . A jacket with hanging sleeves , slashed with velvet at the neck and wrists , showed that he was a man of some consideration , an under-officer , or file-leader of his company . `` I can not think , '' said he , `` why you English should be so fond of your six-foot stick . If it amuse you to bend it , well and good ; but why should I strain and pull , when my little moulinet will do all for me , and better than I can do it for myself ? `` `` I have seen good shooting with the prod and with the latch , '' said Aylward , `` but , by my hilt ! camarade , with all respect to you and to your bow , I think that is but a woman 's weapon , which a woman can point and loose as easily as a man . `` `` I know not about that , '' answered the Brabanter , `` but this I know , that though I have served for fourteen years , I have never yet seen an Englishman do aught with the long-bow which I could not do better with my arbalest . By the three kings ! I would even go further , and say that I have done things with my arbalest which no Englishman could do with his long-bow . `` `` Well said , mon gar. , '' cried Aylward . `` A good cock has ever a brave call . Now , I have shot little of late , but there is Johnston here who will try a round with you for the honor of the Company . `` `` And I will lay a gallon of Jurancon wine upon the long-bow , '' said Black Simon , `` though I had rather , for my own drinking , that it were a quart of Twynham ale . `` `` I take both your challenge and your wager , '' said the man of Brabant , throwing off his jacket and glancing keenly about him with his black , twinkling eyes . `` I can not see any fitting mark , for I care not to waste a bolt upon these shields , which a drunken boor could not miss at a village kermesse . `` `` This is a perilous man , '' whispered an English man-at-arms , plucking at Aylward 's sleeve . `` He is the best marksman of all the crossbow companies and it was he who brought down the Constable de Bourbon at Brignais . I fear that your man will come by little honor with him . `` `` Yet I have seen Johnston shoot these twenty years , and I will not flinch from it . How say you , old war-hound , will you not have a flight shot or two with this springald ? `` `` Tut , tut , Aylward , '' said the old bowman . `` My day is past , and it is for the younger ones to hold what we have gained . I take it unkindly of thee , Samkin , that thou shouldst call all eyes thus upon a broken bowman who could once shoot a fair shaft . Let me feel that bow , Wilkins ! It is a Scotch bow , I see , for the upper nock is without and the lower within . By the black rood ! it is a good piece of yew , well nocked , well strung , well waxed , and very joyful to the feel . I think even now that I might hit any large and goodly mark with a bow like this . Turn thy quiver to me , Aylward . I love an ash arrow pierced with cornel-wood for a roving shaft . `` `` By my hilt ! and so do I , '' cried Aylward . `` These three gander-winged shafts are such . `` `` So I see , comrade . It has been my wont to choose a saddle-backed feather for a dead shaft , and a swine-backed for a smooth flier . I will take the two of them . Ah ! Samkin , lad , the eye grows dim and the hand less firm as the years pass . `` `` Come then , are you not ready ? '' said the Brabanter , who had watched with ill-concealed impatience the slow and methodic movements of his antagonist . `` I will venture a rover with you , or try long-butts or hoyles , '' said old Johnston . `` To my mind the long-bow is a better weapon than the arbalest , but it may be ill for me to prove it . `` `` So I think , '' quoth the other with a sneer . He drew his moulinet from his girdle , and fixing it to the windlass , he drew back the powerful double cord until it had clicked into the catch . Then from his quiver he drew a short , thick quarrel , which he placed with the utmost care upon the groove . Word had spread of what was going forward , and the rivals were already surrounded , not only by the English archers of the Company , but by hundreds of arbalestiers and men-at-arms from the bands of Ortingo and La Nuit , to the latter of which the Brabanter belonged . `` There is a mark yonder on the hill , '' said he ; `` mayhap you can discern it . `` `` I see something , '' answered Johnston , shading his eyes with his hand ; `` but it is a very long shoot . `` `` A fair shoot -- -a fair shoot ! Stand aside , Arnaud , lest you find a bolt through your gizzard . Now , comrade , I take no flight shot , and I give you the vantage of watching my shaft . `` As he spoke he raised his arbalest to his shoulder and was about to pull the trigger , when a large gray stork flapped heavily into view skimming over the brow of the hill , and then soaring up into the air to pass the valley . Its shrill and piercing cries drew all eyes upon it , and , as it came nearer , a dark spot which circled above it resolved itself into a peregrine falcon , which hovered over its head , poising itself from time to time , and watching its chance of closing with its clumsy quarry . Nearer and nearer came the two birds , all absorbed in their own contest , the stork wheeling upwards , the hawk still fluttering above it , until they were not a hundred paces from the camp . The Brabanter raised his weapon to the sky , and there came the short , deep twang of his powerful string . His bolt struck the stork just where its wing meets the body , and the bird whirled aloft in a last convulsive flutter before falling wounded and flapping to the earth . A roar of applause burst from the crossbowmen ; but at the instant that the bolt struck its mark old Johnston , who had stood listlessly with arrow on string , bent his bow and sped a shaft through the body of the falcon . Whipping the other from his belt , he sent it skimming some few feet from the earth with so true an aim that it struck and transfixed the stork for the second time ere it could reach the ground . A deep-chested shout of delight burst from the archers at the sight of this double feat , and Aylward , dancing with joy , threw his arms round the old marksman and embraced him with such vigor that their mail tunics clanged again. '' Ah ! camarade , '' he cried , `` you shall have a stoup with me for this ! What then , old dog , would not the hawk please thee , but thou must have the stork as well . Oh , to my heart again ! `` `` It is a pretty piece of yew , and well strung , '' said Johnston with a twinkle in his deep-set gray eyes . `` Even an old broken bowman might find the clout with a bow like this . `` `` You have done very well , '' remarked the Brabanter in a surly voice . `` But it seems to me that you have not yet shown yourself to be a better marksman than I , for I have struck that at which I aimed , and , by the three kings ! no man can do more . `` `` It would ill beseem me to claim to be a better marksman , '' answered Johnston , `` for I have heard great things of your skill . I did but wish to show that the long-bow could do that which an arbalest could not do , for you could not with your moulinet have your string ready to speed another shaft ere the bird drop to the earth . `` `` In that you have vantage , '' said the crossbowman . `` By Saint James ! it is now my turn to show you where my weapon has the better of you . I pray you to draw a flight shaft with all your strength down the valley , that we may see the length of your shoot . `` `` That is a very strong prod of yours , '' said Johnston , shaking his grizzled head as he glanced at the thick arch and powerful strings of his rival 's arbalest . `` I have little doubt that you can overshoot me , and yet I have seen bowmen who could send a cloth-yard arrow further than you could speed a quarrel . `` `` So I have heard , '' remarked the Brabanter ; `` and yet it is a strange thing that these wondrous bowmen are never where I chance to be . Pace out the distances with a wand at every five score , and do you , Arnaud , stand at the fifth wand to carry back my bolts to me . `` A line was measured down the valley , and Johnston , drawing an arrow to the very head , sent it whistling over the row of wands . `` Bravely drawn ! A rare shoot ! '' shouted the bystanders . `` It is well up to the fourth mark . `` `` By my hilt
