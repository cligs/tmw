hath it at the end of his tongue . `` `` Not I , in troth , '' replied the other ; `` I have had other things to think of . There was some sort of bickering over dice , or wine , or was it a woman , coz ? `` `` Pasques Dieu ! but you have nicked it , '' cried Aylward . `` It was indeed about a woman ; and the quarrel must go forward , for I am still of the same mind as before . `` `` What of the woman , then ? '' asked Simon . `` May the murrain strike me if I can call to mind aught about her . `` `` It was La Blanche Rose , maid at the sign of the 'Trois Corbeaux ' at Limoges . Bless her pretty heart ! Why , mon gar. , I loved her . `` `` So did a many , '' quoth Simon . `` I call her to mind now . On the very day that we fought over the little hussy , she went off with Evan ap Price , a long-legged Welsh dagsman . They have a hostel of their own now , somewhere on the banks of the Garonne , where the landlord drinks so much of the liquor that there is little left for the customers . `` `` So ends our quarrel , then , '' said Aylward , sheathing his sword . `` A Welsh dagsman , i ' faith ! C'etait mauvais gout , camarade , and the more so when she had a jolly archer and a lusty man-at-arms to choose from . `` `` True , old lad . And it is as well that we can compose our differences honorably , for Sir Nigel had been out at the first clash of steel ; and he hath sworn that if there be quarrelling in the garrison he would smite the right hand from the broilers . You know him of old , and that he is like to be as good as his word. '' '' Mort-Dieu ! yes . But there are ale , mead , and wine in the buttery , and the steward a merry rogue , who will not haggle over a quart or two . Buvons , mon gar. , for it is not every day that two old friends come together . `` The old soldiers and Hordle John strode off together in all good fellowship . Alleyne had turned to follow them , when he felt a touch upon his shoulder , and found a young page by his side . `` The Lord Loring commands , '' said the boy , `` that you will follow me to the great chamber , and await him there . `` `` But my comrades ? `` `` His commands were for you alone . `` Alleyne followed the messenger to the east end of the courtyard , where a broad flight of steps led up to the doorway of the main hall , the outer wall of which is washed by the waters of the Avon . As designed at first , no dwelling had been allotted to the lord of the castle and his family but the dark and dismal basement story of the keep . A more civilized or more effeminate generation , however , had refused to be pent up in such a cellar , and the hall with its neighboring chambers had been added for their accommodation . Up the broad steps Alleyne went , still following his boyish guide , until at the folding oak doors the latter paused , and ushered him into the main hall of the castle.On entering the room the clerk looked round ; but , seeing no one , he continued to stand , his cap in his hand , examining with the greatest interest a chamber which was so different to any to which he was accustomed . The days had gone by when a nobleman 's hall was but a barn-like , rush-strewn enclosure , the common lounge and eating-room of every inmate of the castle . The Crusaders had brought back with them experiences of domestic luxuries , of Damascus carpets and rugs of Aleppo , which made them impatient of the hideous bareness and want of privacy which they found in their ancestral strongholds . Still stronger , however , had been the influence of the great French war ; for , however well matched the nations might be in martial exercises , there could be no question but that our neighbors were infinitely superior to us in the arts of peace . A stream of returning knights , of wounded soldiers , and of unransomed French noblemen , had been for a quarter of a century continually pouring into England , every one of whom exerted an influence in the direction of greater domestic refinement , while shiploads of French furniture from Calais , Rouen , and other plundered towns , had supplied our own artisans with models on which to shape their work . Hence , in most English castles , and in Castle Twynham among the rest , chambers were to be found which would seem to be not wanting either in beauty or in comfort.In the great stone fireplace a log fire was spurting and crackling , throwing out a ruddy glare which , with the four bracket-lamps which stood at each corner of the room , gave a bright and lightsome air to the whole apartment . Above was a wreath-work of blazonry , extending up to the carved and corniced oaken roof ; while on either side stood the high canopied chairs placed for the master of the house and for his most honored guest . The walls were hung all round with most elaborate and brightly colored tapestry , representing the achievements of Sir Bevis of Hampton , and behind this convenient screen were stored the tables dormant and benches which would be needed for banquet or high festivity . The floor was of polished tiles , with a square of red and black diapered Flemish carpet in the centre ; and many settees , cushions , folding chairs , and carved bancals littered all over it . At the further end was a long black buffet or dresser , thickly covered with gold cups , silver salvers , and other such valuables . All this Alleyne examined with curious eyes ; but most interesting of all to him was a small ebony table at his very side , on which , by the side of a chess-board and the scattered chessmen , there lay an open manuscript written in a right clerkly hand , and set forth with brave flourishes and devices along the margins . In vain Alleyne bethought him of where he was , and of those laws of good breeding and decorum which should restrain him : those colored capitals and black even lines drew his hand down to them , as the loadstone draws the needle , until , almost before he knew it , he was standing with the romance of Garin de Montglane before his eyes , so absorbed in its contents as to be completely oblivious both of where he was and why he had come there.He was brought back to himself , however , by a sudden little ripple of quick feminine laughter . Aghast , he dropped the manuscript among the chessmen and stared in bewilderment round the room . It was as empty and as still as ever . Again he stretched his hand out to the romance , and again came that roguish burst of merriment . He looked up at the ceiling , back at the closed door , and round at the stiff folds of motionless tapestry . Of a sudden , however , he caught a quick shimmer from the corner of a high-backed bancal in front of him , and , shifting a pace or two to the side , saw a white slender hand , which held a mirror of polished silver in such a way that the concealed observer could see without being seen . He stood irresolute , uncertain whether to advance or to take no notice ; but , even as he hesitated , the mirror was whipped in , and a tall and stately young lady swept out from behind the oaken screen , with a dancing light of mischief in her eyes . Alleyne started with astonishment as he recognized the very maiden who had suffered from his brother 's violence in the forest . She no longer wore her gay riding-dress , however , but was attired in a long sweeping robe of black velvet of Bruges , with delicate tracery of white lace at neck and at wrist , scarce to be seen against her ivory skin . Beautiful as she had seemed to him before , the lithe charm of her figure and the proud , free grace of her bearing were enhanced now by the rich simplicity of her attire . `` Ah , you start , '' said she , with the same sidelong look of mischief , `` and I can not marvel at it . Didst not look to see the distressed damosel again . Oh that I were a minstrel , that I might put it into rhyme , with the whole romance -- -the luckless maid , the wicked socman , and the virtuous clerk ! So might our fame have gone down together for all time , and you be numbered with Sir Percival or Sir Galahad , or all the other rescuers of oppressed ladies . `` `` What I did , '' said Alleyne , `` was too small a thing for thanks ; and yet , if I may say it without offence , it was too grave and near a matter for mirth and raillery . I had counted on my brother 's love , but God has willed that it should be otherwise . It is a joy to me to see you again , lady , and to know that you have reached home in safety , if this be indeed your home . `` `` Yes , in sooth , Castle Twynham is my home , and Sir Nigel Loring my father . I should have told you so this morning , but you said that you were coming thither , so I bethought me that I might hold it back as a surprise to you . Oh dear , but it was brave to see you ! '' she cried , bursting out a-laughing once more , and standing with her hand pressed to her side , and her half-closed eyes twinkling with amusement . `` You drew back and came forward with your eyes upon my book there , like the mouse who sniffs the cheese and yet dreads the trap . `` `` I take shame , '' said Alleyne , `` that I should have touched it . `` `` Nay , it warmed my very heart to see it . So glad was I , that I laughed for very pleasure . My fine preacher can himself be tempted then , thought I ; he is not made of another clay to the rest of us . `` `` God help me ! I am the weakest of the weak , '' groaned Alleyne . `` I pray that I may have more strength . `` `` And to what end ? '' she asked sharply . `` If you are , as I understand , to shut yourself forever in your cell within the four walls of an abbey , then of what use
