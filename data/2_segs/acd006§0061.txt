'' he said , `` to think that within the compass of this tiny bottle lies a cure for every earthly evil ! One draught and the body slips off like a garment , while the soul walks forth in all its beauty and freedom . Trouble is over . One draught , and -- -Ah , let go , I say ! What have you done ? `` Kate had snatched the bottle from him , and with a quick feminine gesture had hurled it against the wall , where it splintered to pieces , sending a strong turpentiney odour through the apartment . Her strength was so impaired that she staggered back after this feat , and sat down on the side of the bed , while her guardian , grim and threatening , stood over her with his long , bony fingers opening and shutting , as though he found it difficult to keep them from her throat . `` I will not help you in it , '' she said , in a low but firm voice . `` You would kill my soul as well . `` The mask had fairly dropped from Girdlestone . No gaunt old wolf could have glared down with fiercer eyes or a more cruel mouth . `` You fool ! '' he hissed . `` I am not afraid to die , '' she said , looking up at him with brave , steadfast eyes.Girdlestone recovered his self-possession by an effort . `` It is clear to me , '' he said calmly , `` that your reason is unhinged . What is all this nonsense about death ? There is nothing that will harm you except your own evil actions . '' He turned abruptly and strode out of the room with the firm and decided step of a man who has taken an irrevocable resolution.With a set and rigid face he ascended the steps which led to his bedroom , and , rummaging in his desk , produced a telegram form . This he filled up and took with him downstairs . There he put on his hat and started off to the Bedsworth Post-office at full speed.At the avenue gate he met his sentinel , who was sitting on his camp stool as grim as ever . `` She is very bad , Stevens , '' Girdlestone said , stopping and jerking his head in the direction of the house . `` She is going downhill . I am afraid that she ca n't last long . If any one asks you about her , you can say that she was despaired of . I am just sending off a telegram to a doctor in London , so that she may have the best advice . `` Stevens touched his greasy-peaked cap as a token of respect . `` She was down here behavin ' outrageous the other day , '' said he . `` 'Let me pass , ' says she , 'and you shall have ten golden guineas . ' Them 's her very words . 'Not for ten hundred golden guineas , ' I answers , 'would William Stevens , hesquire , do what he did n't ought to . ' '' '' Very proper , very proper indeed , '' said Girdlestone approvingly . `` Every man in his own station has his own duties to fulfil , and he will be judged as he has fulfilled them , well or ill . I shall see that you are no loser by your staunchness . `` `` Thank ye , guv'nor . `` `` She is wild and delirious , and can get about in spite of her low state of health . It is possible that she may make some effort to get away , so be vigilant . Good day to you . `` `` Good day , sir . '' William Stevens stood at the gate , looking pensively after his employer ; then he reseated himself upon his camp-stool , and , lighting his pipe , resumed his meditations . `` I ca n't make nought of it , '' he muttered , scratching his head , `` It do seem uncommon queer , to be sure . The boss he says , 'She 's very low , ' says he , and then next minute he says , 'She may be comin ' down and tryin ' to escape . 'I 've seen diers o ' all shapes and sizes , but I 've never seed one as went a galivantin ' about like this -- -at least , not among them as died a nat'ral death . It do seem uncommon strange . Then , again , he 's off telegrayphin ' for a doctor to Lunnon , when there 's Doctor Corbett , o ' Claxton , or Doctor Hutton , o ' Bedsworth , would come quick enough if he wanted them . I ca n't make no sense of it . Why , bust my buttons ! '' he continued , taking his pipe out of his mouth in a paroxysm of astonishment , `` if here hai n't the dier herself ! `` It was , indeed , Kate , who , learning that her guardian was gone , had come out with some vague idea of making a last struggle for her life and freedom . With the courage of despair , she came straight down the avenue to the sole spot where escape seemed possible . `` Good mornin ' , missy , '' cried Stevens , as she approached . `` You do n't look extra bright this mornin ' , but you ai n't as bad as your good guardian made me think . You do n't seem to feel no difficulty in gettin ' about . `` `` There is nothing the matter with me , '' the girl answered earnestly . `` I assure you there is not . My mind is as sound as yours . `` `` That 's what they all says , '' said the ex-warder with a chuckle . `` But it is so . I can not stay in that house longer . I can not , Mr.Stevens , I can not ! It is haunted , and my guardian will murder me.He means to . I read it in his eyes . He as good as tried this morning.To die without one word to those I love -- -without any explanation of whathas passed -- -that would give a sting to death . `` `` Well , if this ai n't outragis ! '' cried the one-eyed man ; `` perfectly outragis ! Going to murder you , says you ! What 's he a-goin ' to do that for ? `` `` God knows ! He hates me for some reason . I have never gone against his wishes , save in one respect , and in that I can never obey him , for it is a matter in which he has no right to command . `` `` Quite so ! '' said Stevens , winking his one eye . `` I knows the feeling myself , cuss me , but I do ! 'Thine for once and thine for never , ' as the song says . `` `` Why wo n't you let me pass ? '' pleaded Kate . `` You may have had daughters of your own . What would you do if they were treated as I have been ? If I had money you should have it , but I have none . Do , do let me go ! God will reward you for it . Perhaps when you are on your last bed of sickness the memory of this one good deed may outweigh all the evil that you have done . `` `` Lor ' , do n't she speak ! '' said Stevens , appealing confidentially to the nearest tree . `` It 's like a dictionary . `` `` And you wo n't lose by it in this life , '' the girl added eagerly . `` See , here is my watch and my chain . You shall have that if you will let me through ? `` `` Let 's see it . '' He opened it and examined it critically . `` Eighteen carat -- -it 's only a Geneva , though . What can you expect for aGeneva ? `` `` And you shall have fifty pounds when I get back to my friends . Do let me pass , good Mr. Stevens , for my guardian may return at any moment . `` `` See here , miss , '' Stevens said solemnly ; `` dooty is dooty , and if every hair of your 'ead was tagged wi ' a jewel , and you offered to make me your barber , I would n't let you through that gate . As to this 'ere watch , if so be as you would like to write a line to your friends , I 'll post it for you at Bedsworth in exchange for it , though it be only a Geneva . `` `` You good , kind man ! '' cried Kate , all excitement and delight . `` I have a pencil in my pocket . What shall I do for paper ? '' She looked eagerly round and spied a small piece which lay among the brushwood . With a cry of joy she picked it out . It was very coarse and very dirty , but she managed to scrawl a few lines upon it , describing her situation and asking for aid . `` I will write the address upon the back , '' she said . `` When you get to Bedsworth you must buy an envelope and ask the post-office people to copy the address on to it . `` `` I bargained to post it for the Geneva , '' he said . `` I did n't bargain to buy envelopes and copy addresses . That 's a nice pencil-case of yourn . Now I 'll make a clean job of it if you 'll throw that in . `` Kate handed it over without a murmur . At last a small ray of light seemed to be finding its way through the darkness which had so long surrounded her . Stevens put the watch and pencil-case in his pocket , and took the little scrap of paper on which so much depended . As Kate handed it to him she saw over his shoulder that coming up the lane was a small pony-carriage , in which sat a buxom lady and a very small page . The sleek little brown pony which drew it ambled along at a methodical pace which showed that it was entirely master of the situation , while the whole turnout had an indescribable air of comfort and good nature . Poor Kate had been so separated from her kind that the sight of people who , if not friendly , were at least not hostile to her , sent a thrill of pleasure into her heart . There was something wholesome and prosaic too about this homely equipage , which was inexpressibly soothing to a mind so worn by successive terrors . `` Here 's some one a-comin ' , '' cried Stevens . `` Clear out from here -- -it 's the governor 's orders . `` `` Oh , do let me stay and say one word to the lady ! '' Stevens seized his great stick savagely . `` Clear out ! '' he cried in a hoarse , angry voice , and made a step towards her as if he would strike
