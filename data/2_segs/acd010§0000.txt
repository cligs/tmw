Mr. Hungerton , her father , really was the most tactless person upon earth , -- -a fluffy , feathery , untidy cockatoo of a man , perfectly good-natured , but absolutely centered upon his own silly self . If anything could have driven me from Gladys , it would have been the thought of such a father-in-law . I am convinced that he really believed in his heart that I came round to the Chestnuts three days a week for the pleasure of his company , and very especially to hear his views upon bimetallism , a subject upon which he was by way of being an authority.For an hour or more that evening I listened to his monotonous chirrup about bad money driving out good , the token value of silver , the depreciation of the rupee , and the true standards of exchange . `` Suppose , '' he cried with feeble violence , `` that all the debts in the world were called up simultaneously , and immediate payment insisted upon , -- -what under our present conditions would happen then ? `` I gave the self-evident answer that I should be a ruined man , upon which he jumped from his chair , reproved me for my habitual levity , which made it impossible for him to discuss any reasonable subject in my presence , and bounced off out of the room to dress for a Masonic meeting.At last I was alone with Gladys , and the moment of Fate had come ! All that evening I had felt like the soldier who awaits the signal which will send him on a forlorn hope ; hope of victory and fear of repulse alternating in his mind.She sat with that proud , delicate profile of hers outlined against the red curtain . How beautiful she was ! And yet how aloof ! We had been friends , quite good friends ; but never could I get beyond the same comradeship which I might have established with one of my fellow-reporters upon the Gazette , -- -perfectly frank , perfectly kindly , and perfectly unsexual . My instincts are all against a woman being too frank and at her ease with me . It is no compliment to a man . Where the real sex feeling begins , timidity and distrust are its companions , heritage from old wicked days when love and violence went often hand in hand . The bent head , the averted eye , the faltering voice , the wincing figure -- -these , and not the unshrinking gaze and frank reply , are the true signals of passion . Even in my short life I had learned as much as that -- -or had inherited it in that race memory which we call instinct.Gladys was full of every womanly quality . Some judged her to be cold and hard ; but such a thought was treason . That delicately bronzed skin , almost oriental in its coloring , that raven hair , the large liquid eyes , the full but exquisite lips , -- -all the stigmata of passion were there . But I was sadly conscious that up to now I had never found the secret of drawing it forth . However , come what might , I should have done with suspense and bring matters to a head to-night . She could but refuse me , and better be a repulsed lover than an accepted brother.So far my thoughts had carried me , and I was about to break the long and uneasy silence , when two critical , dark eyes looked round at me , and the proud head was shaken in smiling reproof . `` I have a presentiment that you are going to propose , Ned . I do wish you would n't ; for things are so much nicer as they are . `` I drew my chair a little nearer . `` Now , how did you know that I was going to propose ? '' I asked in genuine wonder . `` Do n't women always know ? Do you suppose any woman in the world was ever taken unawares ? But -- -oh , Ned , our friendship has been so good and so pleasant ! What a pity to spoil it ! Do n't you feel how splendid it is that a young man and a young woman should be able to talk face to face as we have talked ? `` `` I do n't know , Gladys . You see , I can talk face to face with -- -with the station-master . '' I ca n't imagine how that official came into the matter ; but in he trotted , and set us both laughing . `` That does not satisfy me in the least . I want my arms round you , and your head on my breast , and -- -oh , Gladys , I want -- -- -- '' She had sprung from her chair , as she saw signs that I proposed to demonstrate some of my wants . `` You 've spoiled everything , Ned , '' she said . `` It 's all so beautiful and natural until this kind of thing comes in ! It is such a pity ! Why ca n't you control yourself ? `` `` I did n't invent it , '' I pleaded . `` It 's nature . It 's love . `` `` Well , perhaps if both love , it may be different . I have never felt it . `` `` But you must -- -you , with your beauty , with your soul ! Oh , Gladys , you were made for love ! You must love ! `` `` One must wait till it comes . `` `` But why ca n't you love me , Gladys ? Is it my appearance , or what ? `` She did unbend a little . She put forward a hand -- -such a gracious , stooping attitude it was -- -and she pressed back my head . Then she looked into my upturned face with a very wistful smile . `` No it is n't that , '' she said at last . `` You 're not a conceited boy by nature , and so I can safely tell you it is not that . It 's deeper . `` `` My character ? `` She nodded severely . `` What can I do to mend it ? Do sit down and talk it over . No , really , I wo n't if you 'll only sit down ! `` She looked at me with a wondering distrust which was much more to my mind than her whole-hearted confidence . How primitive and bestial it looks when you put it down in black and white ! -- -and perhaps after all it is only a feeling peculiar to myself . Anyhow , she sat down . `` Now tell me what 's amiss with me ? `` `` I 'm in love with somebody else , '' said she.It was my turn to jump out of my chair . `` It 's nobody in particular , '' she explained , laughing at the expression of my face : `` only an ideal . I 've never met the kind of man I mean . `` `` Tell me about him . What does he look like ? `` `` Oh , he might look very much like you . `` `` How dear of you to say that ! Well , what is it that he does that I do n't do ? Just say the word , -- -teetotal , vegetarian , aeronaut , theosophist , superman . I 'll have a try at it , Gladys , if you will only give me an idea what would please you . `` She laughed at the elasticity of my character . `` Well , in the first place , I do n't think my ideal would speak like that , '' said she . `` He would be a harder , sterner man , not so ready to adapt himself to a silly girl 's whim . But , above all , he must be a man who could do , who could act , who could look Death in the face and have no fear of him , a man of great deeds and strange experiences . It is never a man that I should love , but always the glories he had won ; for they would be reflected upon me . Think of Richard Burton ! When I read his wife 's life of him I could so understand her love ! And Lady Stanley ! Did you ever read the wonderful last chapter of that book about her husband ? These are the sort of men that a woman could worship with all her soul , and yet be the greater , not the less , on account of her love , honored by all the world as the inspirer of noble deeds . `` She looked so beautiful in her enthusiasm that I nearly brought down the whole level of the interview . I gripped myself hard , and went on with the argument . `` We ca n't all be Stanleys and Burtons , '' said I ; `` besides , we do n't get the chance , -- -at least , I never had the chance . If I did , I should try to take it . `` `` But chances are all around you . It is the mark of the kind of man I mean that he makes his own chances . You ca n't hold him back . I 've never met him , and yet I seem to know him so well . There are heroisms all round us waiting to be done . It 's for men to do them , and for women to reserve their love as a reward for such men . Look at that young Frenchman who went up last week in a balloon . It was blowing a gale of wind ; but because he was announced to go he insisted on starting . The wind blew him fifteen hundred miles in twenty-four hours , and he fell in the middle of Russia . That was the kind of man I mean . Think of the woman he loved , and how other women must have envied her ! That 's what I should like to be , -- -envied for my man . `` `` I 'd have done it to please you . `` `` But you should n't do it merely to please me . You should do it because you ca n't help yourself , because it 's natural to you , because the man in you is crying out for heroic expression . Now , when you described the Wigan coal explosion last month , could you not have gone down and helped those people , in spite of the choke-damp ? `` `` I did . `` `` You never said so . `` `` There was nothing worth bucking about . `` `` I did n't know . '' She looked at me with rather more interest . `` That was brave of you . `` `` I had to . If you want to write good copy , you must be where the things are . `` `` What a prosaic motive ! It seems to take all the romance out of it . But , still , whatever your motive , I am glad that you went down that mine . '' She gave me her hand ; but with such sweetness and dignity
