becomes rounded off , and difficulty after difficulty thins away in front of us , '' said Holmes as we stood waiting for the arrival of the express from town . `` I shall soon be in the position of being able to put into a single connected narrative one of the most singular and sensational crimes of modern times . Students of criminology will remember the analogous incidents in Godno , in Little Russia , in the year '66 , and of course there are the Anderson murders in North Carolina , but this case possesses some features which are entirely its own . Even now we have no clear case against this very wily man . But I shall be very much surprised if it is not clear enough before we go to bed this night . `` The London express came roaring into the station , and a small , wiry bulldog of a man had sprung from a first-class carriage . We all three shook hands , and I saw at once from the reverential way in which Lestrade gazed at my companion that he had learned a good deal since the days when they had first worked together . I could well remember the scorn which the theories of the reasoner used then to excite in the practical man . `` Anything good ? '' he asked . `` The biggest thing for years , '' said Holmes . `` We have two hours before we need think of starting . I think we might employ it in getting some dinner and then , Lestrade , we will take the London fog out of your throat by giving you a breath of the pure night air of Dartmoor . Never been there ? Ah , well , I do n't suppose you will forget your first visit . `` One of Sherlock Holmes 's defects -- -if , indeed , one may call it a defect -- -was that he was exceedingly loath to communicate his full plans to any other person until the instant of their fulfilment . Partly it came no doubt from his own masterful nature , which loved to dominate and surprise those who were around him . Partly also from his professional caution , which urged him never to take any chances . The result , however , was very trying for those who were acting as his agents and assistants . I had often suffered under it , but never more so than during that long drive in the darkness . The great ordeal was in front of us ; at last we were about to make our final effort , and yet Holmes had said nothing , and I could only surmise what his course of action would be . My nerves thrilled with anticipation when at last the cold wind upon our faces and the dark , void spaces on either side of the narrow road told me that we were back upon the moor once again . Every stride of the horses and every turn of the wheels was taking us nearer to our supreme adventure.Our conversation was hampered by the presence of the driver of the hired wagonette , so that we were forced to talk of trivial matters when our nerves were tense with emotion and anticipation . It was a relief to me , after that unnatural restraint , when we at last passed Frankland 's house and knew that we were drawing near to the Hall and to the scene of action . We did not drive up to the door but got down near the gate of the avenue . The wagonette was paid off and ordered to return to Coombe Tracey forthwith , while we started to walk to Merripit House . `` Are you armed , Lestrade ? `` The little detective smiled . `` As long as I have my trousers I have a hip-pocket , and as long as I have my hip-pocket I have something in it. '' '' Good ! My friend and I are also ready for emergencies . `` `` You 're mighty close about this affair , Mr. Holmes . What 's the game now ? `` `` A waiting game . `` `` My word , it does not seem a very cheerful place , '' said the detective with a shiver , glancing round him at the gloomy slopes of the hill and at the huge lake of fog which lay over the Grimpen Mire . `` I see the lights of a house ahead of us . `` `` That is Merripit House and the end of our journey . I must request you to walk on tiptoe and not to talk above a whisper . `` We moved cautiously along the track as if we were bound for the house , but Holmes halted us when we were about two hundred yards from it . `` This will do , '' said he . `` These rocks upon the right make an admirable screen . `` `` We are to wait here ? `` `` Yes , we shall make our little ambush here . Get into this hollow , Lestrade . You have been inside the house , have you not , Watson ? Can you tell the position of the rooms ? What are those latticed windows at this end ? `` `` I think they are the kitchen windows . `` `` And the one beyond , which shines so brightly ? `` `` That is certainly the dining-room . `` `` The blinds are up . You know the lie of the land best . Creep forward quietly and see what they are doing -- -but for heaven 's sake do n't let them know that they are watched ! `` I tiptoed down the path and stooped behind the low wall which surrounded the stunted orchard . Creeping in its shadow I reached a point whence I could look straight through the uncurtained window.There were only two men in the room , Sir Henry and Stapleton . They sat with their profiles towards me on either side of the round table . Both of them were smoking cigars , and coffee and wine were in front of them . Stapleton was talking with animation , but the baronet looked pale and distrait . Perhaps the thought of that lonely walk across the ill-omened moor was weighing heavily upon his mind.As I watched them Stapleton rose and left the room , while Sir Henry filled his glass again and leaned back in his chair , puffing at his cigar . I heard the creak of a door and the crisp sound of boots upon gravel . The steps passed along the path on the other side of the wall under which I crouched . Looking over , I saw the naturalist pause at the door of an out-house in the corner of the orchard . A key turned in a lock , and as he passed in there was a curious scuffling noise from within . He was only a minute or so inside , and then I heard the key turn once more and he passed me and reentered the house . I saw him rejoin his guest , and I crept quietly back to where my companions were waiting to tell them what I had seen . `` You say , Watson , that the lady is not there ? '' Holmes asked when I had finished my report. '' No . `` `` Where can she be , then , since there is no light in any other room except the kitchen ? `` `` I can not think where she is . `` I have said that over the great Grimpen Mire there hung a dense , white fog . It was drifting slowly in our direction and banked itself up like a wall on that side of us , low but thick and well defined . The moon shone on it , and it looked like a great shimmering ice-field , with the heads of the distant tors as rocks borne upon its surface . Holmes 's face was turned towards it , and he muttered impatiently as he watched its sluggish drift . `` It 's moving towards us , Watson . `` `` Is that serious ? `` `` Very serious , indeed -- -the one thing upon earth which could have disarranged my plans . He ca n't be very long , now . It is already ten o'clock . Our success and even his life may depend upon his coming out before the fog is over the path . `` The night was clear and fine above us . The stars shone cold and bright , while a half-moon bathed the whole scene in a soft , uncertain light . Before us lay the dark bulk of the house , its serrated roof and bristling chimneys hard outlined against the silver-spangled sky . Broad bars of golden light from the lower windows stretched across the orchard and the moor . One of them was suddenly shut off . The servants had left the kitchen . There only remained the lamp in the dining-room where the two men , the murderous host and the unconscious guest , still chatted over their cigars.Every minute that white woolly plain which covered one-half of the moor was drifting closer and closer to the house . Already the first thin wisps of it were curling across the golden square of the lighted window . The farther wall of the orchard was already invisible , and the trees were standing out of a swirl of white vapour . As we watched it the fog-wreaths came crawling round both corners of the house and rolled slowly into one dense bank on which the upper floor and the roof floated like a strange ship upon a shadowy sea . Holmes struck his hand passionately upon the rock in front of us and stamped his feet in his impatience . `` If he is n't out in a quarter of an hour the path will be covered . In half an hour we wo n't be able to see our hands in front of us . `` `` Shall we move farther back upon higher ground ? `` `` Yes , I think it would be as well . `` So as the fog-bank flowed onward we fell back before it until we were half a mile from the house , and still that dense white sea , with the moon silvering its upper edge , swept slowly and inexorably on . `` We are going too far , '' said Holmes . `` We dare not take the chance of his being overtaken before he can reach us . At all costs we must hold our ground where we are . '' He dropped on his knees and clapped his ear to the ground . `` Thank God , I think that I hear him coming . `` A sound of quick steps broke the silence of the moor . Crouching among the stones we stared intently at the silver-tipped bank in front of us . The steps grew louder , and through the fog , as through a curtain , there stepped the man whom we were awaiting . He looked round him in surprise as he emerged into the clear , starlit night . Then he came swiftly along the path , passed close to where we lay , and went on up the long slope behind us . As he walked he glanced continually over either shoulder , like a man who is ill at ease. '' Hist ! '' cried Holmes , and I heard the sharp click of
