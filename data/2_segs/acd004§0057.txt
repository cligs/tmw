words may well be bitter , for bitter is his lot and bitter his thoughts as he rides through his thrice unhappy country . `` `` Sir knight , '' said the prince , `` you speak like a brave man , and our cousin of France is happy in having a cavalier who is so fit to uphold his cause either with tongue or with sword . But if you think such evil of us , how comes it that you have trusted yourselves to us without warranty or safe-conduct ? `` `` Because I knew that you would be here , sire . Had the man who sits upon your right been ruler of this land , I had indeed thought twice before I looked to him for aught that was knightly or generous . '' With a soldierly salute , he wheeled round his horse , and , galloping down the lists , disappeared amid the dense crowd of footmen and of horsemen who were streaming away from the scene of the tournament . `` The insolent villain ! '' cried Pedro , glaring furiously after him . `` I have seen a man 's tongue torn from his jaws for less . Would it not be well even now , Edward , to send horsemen to hale him back ? Bethink you that it may be one of the royal house of France , or at least some knight whose loss would be a heavy blow to his master . Sir William Felton , you are well mounted , gallop after the caitiff , I pray you . `` `` Do so , Sir William , '' said the prince , `` and give him this purse of a hundred nobles as a sign of the respect which I bear for him ; for , by St. George ! he has served his master this day even as I would wish liegeman of mine to serve me . '' So saying , the prince turned his back upon the King of Spain , and springing upon his horse , rode slowly homewards to the Abbey of Saint Andrew's.On the morning after the jousting , when Alleyne Edricson went , as was his custom , into his master 's chamber to wait upon him in his dressing and to curl his hair , he found him already up and very busily at work . He sat at a table by the window , a deer-hound on one side of him and a lurcher on the other , his feet tucked away under the trestle on which he sat , and his tongue in his cheek , with the air of a man who is much perplexed . A sheet of vellum lay upon the board in front of him , and he held a pen in his hand , with which he had been scribbling in a rude schoolboy hand . So many were the blots , however , and so numerous the scratches and erasures , that he had at last given it up in despair , and sat with his single uncovered eye cocked upwards at the ceiling , as one who waits upon inspiration . `` By Saint Paul ! '' he cried , as Alleyne entered , `` you are the man who will stand by me in this matter . I have been in sore need of you , Alleyne . `` `` God be with you , my fair lord ! '' the squire answered . `` I trust that you have taken no hurt from all that you have gone through yesterday . `` `` Nay ; I feel the fresher for it , Alleyne . It has eased my joints , which were somewhat stiff from these years of peace . I trust , Alleyne , that thou didst very carefully note and mark the bearing and carriage of this knight of France ; for it is time , now when you are young , that you should see all that is best , and mould your own actions in accordance . This was a man from whom much honor might be gained , and I have seldom met any one for whom I have conceived so much love and esteem . Could I but learn his name , I should send you to him with my cartel , that we might have further occasion to watch his goodly feats of arms . `` `` It is said , my fair lord , that none know his name save only the Lord Chandos , and that he is under vow not to speak it . So ran the gossip at the squires ' table . `` `` Be he who he might , he was a very hardy gentleman . But I have a task here , Alleyne , which is harder to me than aught that was set before me yesterday . `` `` Can I help you , my lord ? `` `` That indeed you can . I have been writing my greetings to my sweet wife ; for I hear that a messenger goes from the prince to Southampton within the week , and he would gladly take a packet for me . I pray you , Alleyne , to cast your eyes upon what I have written , and see it they are such words as my lady will understand . My fingers , as you can see , are more used to iron and leather than to the drawing of strokes and turning of letters . What then ? Is there aught amiss , that you should stare so ? `` `` It is this first word , my lord . In what tongue were you pleased to write ? `` `` In English ; for my lady talks it more than she doth French . `` Yet this is no English word , my sweet lord . Here are four t 's and never a letter betwixt them . `` `` By St. Paul ! it seemed strange to my eye when I wrote it , '' said Sir Nigel . `` They bristle up together like a clump of lances . We must break their ranks and set them farther apart . The word is 'that . ' Now I will read it to you , Alleyne , and you shall write it out fair ; for we leave Bordeaux this day , and it would be great joy to me to think that the Lady Loring had word from me . `` Alleyne sat down as ordered , with a pen in his hand and a fresh sheet of parchment before him , while Sir Nigel slowly spelled out his letter , running his forefinger on from word to word . `` That my heart is with thee , my dear sweeting , is what thine own heart will assure thee of . All is well with us here , save that Pepin hath the mange on his back , and Pommers hath scarce yet got clear of his stiffness from being four days on ship-board , and the more so because the sea was very high , and we were like to founder on account of a hole in her side , which was made by a stone cast at us by certain sea-rovers , who may the saints have in their keeping , for they have gone from amongst us , as has young Terlake , and two-score mariners and archers , who would be the more welcome here as there is like to be a very fine war , with much honor and all hopes of advancement , for which I go to gather my Company together , who are now at Montaubon , where they pillage and destroy ; yet I hope that , by God 's help , I may be able to show that I am their master , even as , my sweet lady , I am thy servant . `` `` How of that , Alleyne ? '' continued Sir Nigel , blinking at his squire , with an expression of some pride upon his face . `` Have I not told her all that hath befallen us ? `` `` You have said much , my fair lord ; and yet , if I may say so , it is somewhat crowded together , so that my Lady Loring can , mayhap , scarce follow it . Were it in shorter periods -- -- -- '' '' Nay , it boots me not how you marshal them , as long as they are all there at the muster . Let my lady have the words , and she will place them in such order as pleases her best . But I would have you add what it would please her to know . `` `` That will I , '' said Alleyne , blithely , and bent to the task . `` My fair lady and mistress , '' he wrote , `` God hath had us in His keeping , and my lord is well and in good cheer . He hath won much honor at the jousting before the prince , when he alone was able to make it good against a very valiant man from France . Touching the moneys , there is enough and to spare until we reach Montaubon . Herewith , my fair lady , I send my humble regards , entreating you that you will give the same to your daughter , the Lady Maude . May the holy saints have you both in their keeping is ever the prayer of thy servant , `` ALLEYNE EDRICSON . `` `` That is very fairly set forth , '' said Sir Nigel , nodding his bald head as each sentence was read to him . `` And for thyself , Alleyne , if there be any dear friend to whom you would fain give greeting , I can send it for thee within this packet . `` `` There is none , '' said Alleyne , sadly . `` Have you no kinsfolk , then ? `` `` None , save my brother. '' '' Ha ! I had forgotten that there was ill blood betwixt you . But are there none in all England who love thee ? `` `` None that I dare say so . `` `` And none whom you love ? `` `` Nay , I will not say that , '' said Alleyne.Sir Nigel shook his head and laughed softly to himself , `` I see how it is with you , '' he said . `` Have I not noted your frequent sighs and vacant eye ? Is she fair ? `` `` She is indeed , '' cried Alleyne from his heart , all tingling at this sudden turn of the talk . `` And good ? `` `` As an angel . `` `` And yet she loves you not ? `` `` Nay , I can not say that she loves another . `` `` Then you have hopes ? `` `` I could not live else . `` `` Then must you strive to be worthy of her love . Be brave and pure , fearless to the strong and humble to the weak ; and so , whether this love prosper or no , you will have fitted yourself to be honored by a maiden 's love , which is , in sooth , the highest guerdon which a true knight can hope for . `` `` Indeed , my lord , I do so strive , '' said Alleyne ; `` but she is so sweet , so dainty , and of so noble a spirit , that I fear me that
