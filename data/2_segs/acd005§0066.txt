, and yet if they think help is coming from the fort they might venture it . `` `` The wood in front of us is alive with them , '' said Amos . `` They are as busy as beavers among the underwood . `` `` Perhaps they are going to attack from this side , and cover the attack by a fire from the flank . `` `` That is what I think , '' cried the seigneur . `` Bring the spare guns up here and all the men except five for each side . `` The words were hardly out of his mouth when a shrill yell burst from the wood , and in an instant a cloud of warriors dashed out and charged across the open , howling , springing , and waving their guns or tomahawks in the air . With their painted faces , smeared and striped with every vivid colour , their streaming scalp-locks , their waving arms , their open mouths , and their writhings and contortions , no more fiendish crew ever burst into a sleeper 's nightmare . Some of those in front bore canoes between them , and as they reached the stockade they planted them against it and swarmed up them as if they had been scaling-ladders . Others fired through the embrasures and loop-holes , the muzzles of their muskets touching those of the defenders , while others again sprang unaided on to the tops of the palisades and jumped fearlessly down upon the inner side . The Canadians , however , made such a resistance as might be expected from men who knew that no mercy awaited them . They fired whilst they had time to load , and then , clubbing their muskets , they smashed furiously at every red head which showed above the rails . The din within the stockade was infernal , the shouts and cries of the French , the whooping of the savages , and the terrified screaming of the frightened women blending into one dreadful uproar , above which could be heard the high shrill voice of the old seigneur imploring hiscensitairesto stand fast . With his rapier in his hand , his hat lost , his wig awry , and his dignity all thrown to the winds , the old nobleman showed them that day how a soldier of Rocroy could carry himself , and with Du Lhut , Amos , De Catinat and Ephraim Savage , was ever in the forefront of the defence . So desperately did they fight , the sword and musket-butt outreaching the tomahawk , that though at one time fifty Iroquois were over the palisades , they had slain or driven back nearly all of them when a fresh wave burst suddenly over the south face which had been stripped of its defenders . Du Lhut saw in an instant that the enclosure was lost and that only one thing could save the house . `` Hold them for an instant , '' he screamed , and rushing at the brass gun he struck his flint and steel and fired it straight into the thick of the savages . Then as they recoiled for an instant he stuck a nail into the touch-hole and drove it home with a blow from the butt of his gun . Darting across the yard he spiked the gun at the other corner , and was back at the door as the remnants of the garrison were hurled towards it by the rush of the assailants . The Canadians darted in , and swung the ponderous mass of wood into position , breaking the leg of the foremost warrior who had striven to follow them . Then for an instant they had time for breathing and for council.But their case was a very evil one . Had the guns been lost so that they might be turned upon the door , all further resistance would have been vain , but Du Lhut 's presence of mind had saved them from that danger . The two guns upon the river face and the canoes were safe , for they were commanded by the windows of the house . But their numbers were terribly reduced , and those who were left were weary and wounded and spent . Nineteen had gained the house , but one had been shot through the body and lay groaning in the hall , while a second had his shoulder cleft by a tomahawk and could no longer raise his musket . Du Lhut , De la Noue , and De Catinat were uninjured , but Ephraim Savage had a bullet-hole in his forearm , and Amos was bleeding from a cut upon the face . Of the others hardly one was without injury , and yet they had no time to think of their hurts for the danger still pressed and they were lost unless they acted . A few shots from the barricaded windows sufficed to clear the enclosure , for it was all exposed to their aim ; but on the other hand they had the shelter of the stockade now , and from the further side of it they kept up a fierce fire upon the windows . Half-a-dozen of thecensitairesreturned the fusillade , while the leaders consulted as to what had best be done . `` We have twenty-five women and fourteen children , '' said the seigneur . `` I am sure that you will agree with me , gentlemen , that our first duty is towards them . Some of you , like myself , have lost sons or brothers this day . Let us at least save our wives and sisters . `` `` No Iroquois canoes have passed up the river , '' said one of the Canadians . `` If the women start in the darkness they can get away to the fort . `` `` By Saint Anne of Beaupre , '' exclaimed Du Lhut , `` I think it would be well if you could get your men out of this also , for I can not see how it is to be held until morning . `` A murmur of assent broke from the other Canadians , but the old nobleman shook his bewigged head with decision. '' Tut ! Tut ! What nonsense is this ! '' he cried . `` Are we to abandon the manor-house of Sainte Marie to the first gang of savages who choose to make an attack upon it ? No , no , gentlemen , there are still nearly a score of us , and when the garrison learn that we are so pressed , which will be by to-morrow morning at the latest , they will certainly send us relief . `` Du Lhut shook his head moodily . `` If you stand by the fort I will not desert you , '' said he , `` and yet it is a pity to sacrifice brave men for nothing . `` `` The canoes will hardly hold the women and children as it is , '' cried Theuriet . `` There are but two large and four small . There is not space for a single man . `` `` Then that decides it , '' said De Catinat . `` But who are to row the women ? `` `` It is but a few leagues with the current in their favour , and there are none of our women who do not know how to handle a paddle . `` The Iroquois were very quiet now , and an occasional dropping shot from the trees or the stockade was the only sign of their presence . Their losses had been heavy , and they were either engaged in collecting their dead , or in holding a council as to their next move . The twilight was gathering in , and the sun had already sunk beneath the tree-tops . Leaving a watchman at each window , the leaders went round to the back of the house where the canoes were lying upon the bank . There were no signs of the enemy upon the river to the north of them . `` We are in luck , '' said Amos . `` The clouds are gathering and there will be little light . `` `` It is luck indeed , since the moon is only three days past the full , '' answered Du Lhut . `` I wonder that the Iroquois have not cut us off upon the water , but it is likely that their canoes have gone south to bring up another war-party . They may be back soon , and we had best not lose a moment . `` `` In an hour it might be dark enough to start . `` `` I think that there is rain in those clouds , and that will make it darker still . `` The women and children were assembled and their places in each boat were assigned to them . The wives of the censitaires , rough hardy women whose lives had been spent under the shadow of a constant danger , were for the most part quiet and collected , though a few of the younger ones whimpered a little . A woman is always braver when she has a child to draw her thoughts from herself , and each married woman had one now allotted to her as her own special charge until they should reach the fort . To Onega , the Indian wife of the seigneur , who was as wary and as experienced as a war sachem of her people , the command of the women was entrusted . `` It is not very far , Adele , '' said De Catinat , as his wife clung to his arm . `` You remember how we heard the Angelus bells as we journeyed through the woods . That was Fort St. Louis , and it is but a league or two . `` `` But I do not wish to leave you , Amory . We have been together in all our troubles . Oh , Amory , why should we be divided now ? `` `` My dear love , you will tell them at the fort how things are with us , and they will bring us help . `` `` Let the others do that , and I will stay . I will not be useless , Amory . Onega has taught me to load a gun . I will not be afraid , indeed I will not , if you will only let me stay . `` `` You must not ask it , Adele . It is impossible , child I could not let you stay . `` `` But I feel so sure that it would be best . `` The coarser reason of man has not yet learned to value those subtle instincts which guide a woman . De Catinat argued and exhorted until he had silenced if he had not convinced her . `` It is for my sake , dear . You do not know what a load it will be from my heart when I know that you are safe . And you need not be afraid for me . We can easily hold the place until morning . Then the people from the fort will come , for I hear that they have plenty of canoes , and we shall all meet again . `` Adele was silent , but her hands tightened upon his arm . Her husband was still endeavouring to reassure her when a groan burst from the watcher at the window which overlooked the stream . `` There is a canoe on the river to the
