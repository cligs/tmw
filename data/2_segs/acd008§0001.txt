Royal Navy . Fifty such faces may be seen any night of the year round the mess-table of the Royal Naval College in Portsmouth Dockyard -- -faces which bear a closer resemblance to each other than brother does commonly to brother . They are all cast in a common mould , the products of a system which teaches early self-reliance , hardihood , and manliness -- -a fine type upon the whole ; less refined and less intellectual , perhaps , than their brothers of the land , but full of truth and energy and heroism . In figure he was straight , tall , and well-knit , with keen grey eyes , and the sharp prompt manner of a man who has been accustomed both to command and to obey . `` You had my note ? '' he said , as he entered the room . `` I have to go again , Laura . Is n't it a bore ? Old Smithers is short-handed , and wants me back at once . '' He sat down by the girl , and put his brown hand across her white one . `` It wo n't be a very large order this time , '' he continued . `` It 's the flying squadron business -- -Madeira , Gibraltar , Lisbon , and home . I should n't wonder if we were back in March . `` `` It seems only the other day that you landed . '' she answered . `` Poor little girl ! But it wo n't be long . Mind you take good care of her , Robert when I am gone . And when I come again , Laura , it will be the last time mind ! Hang the money ! There are plenty who manage on less . We need not have a house . Why should we ? You can get very nice rooms in Southsea at 2 pounds a week . McDougall , our paymaster , has just married , and he only gives thirty shillings . You would not be afraid , Laura ? `` `` No , indeed . `` `` The dear old governor is so awfully cautious . Wait , wait , wait , that 's always his cry . I tell him that he ought to have been in the Government Heavy Ordnance Department . But I 'll speak to him tonight . I 'll talk him round . See if I do n't . And you must speak to your own governor . Robert here will back you up . And here are the ports and the dates that we are due at each . Mind that you have a letter waiting for me at every one . `` He took a slip of paper from the side pocket of his coat , but , instead of handing it to the young lady , he remained staring at it with the utmost astonishment upon his face . `` Well , I never ! '' he exclaimed . `` Look here , Robert ; what do you call this ? `` `` Hold it to the light . Why , it 's a fifty-pound Bank of England note . Nothing remarkable about it that I can see . `` `` On the contrary . It 's the queerest thing that ever happened to me . I ca n't make head or tail of it . `` `` Come , then , Hector , '' cried Miss McIntyre with a challenge in her eyes . `` Something very queer happened to me also to-day . I 'll bet a pair of gloves that my adventure was more out of the common than yours , though I have nothing so nice to show at the end of it . `` `` Come , I 'll take that , and Robert here shall be the judge . `` `` State your cases . '' The young artist shut up his sketch-book , and rested his head upon his hands with a face of mock solemnity . `` Ladies first ! Go along Laura , though I think I know something of your adventure already . `` `` It was this morning , Hector , '' she said . `` Oh , by the way , the story will make you wild . I had forgotten that . However , you must n't mind , because , really , the poor fellow was perfectly mad . `` `` What on earth was it ? '' asked the young officer , his eyes travelling from the bank-note to hisfiancee . `` Oh , it was harmless enough , and yet you will confess it was very queer . I had gone out for a walk , but as the snow began to fall I took shelter under the shed which the workmen have built at the near end of the great new house . The men have gone , you know , and the owner is supposed to be coming to-morrow , but the shed is still standing . I was sitting there upon a packing-case when a man came down the road and stopped under the same shelter . He was a quiet , pale-faced man , very tall and thin , not much more than thirty , I should think , poorly dressed , but with the look and bearing of a gentleman . He asked me one or two questions about the village and the people , which , of course , I answered , until at last we found ourselves chatting away in the pleasantest and easiest fashion about all sorts of things . The time passed so quickly that I forgot all about the snow until he drew my attention to its having stopped for the moment . Then , just as I was turning to go , what in the world do you suppose that he did ? He took a step towards me , looked in a sad pensive way into my face , and said : \`I wonder whether you could care for me if I were without a penny . ' Was n't it strange ? I was so frightened that I whisked out of the shed , and was off down the road before he could add another word . But really , Hector , you need not look so black , for when I look back at it I can quite see from his tone and manner that he meant no harm . He was thinking aloud , without the least intention of being offensive . I am convinced that the poor fellow was mad. '' '' Hum ! There was some method in his madness , it seems to me , '' remarked her brother . `` There would have been some method in my kicking , '' said the lieutenant savagely . `` I never heard of a more outrageous thing in my life . `` `` Now , I said that you would be wild ! '' She laid her white hand upon the sleeve of his rough frieze jacket . `` It was nothing . I shall never see the poor fellow again . He was evidently a stranger to this part of the country . But that was my little adventure . Now let us have yours . `` The young man crackled the bank-note between his fingers and thumb , while he passed his other hand over his hair with the action of a man who strives to collect himself . `` It is some ridiculous mistake , '' he said . `` I must try and set it right . Yet I do n't know how to set about it either . I was going down to the village from the Vicarage just after dusk when I found a fellow in a trap who had got himself into broken water . One wheel had sunk into the edge of the ditch which had been hidden by the snow , and the whole thing was high and dry , with a list to starboard enough to slide him out of his seat . I lent a hand , of course , and soon had the wheel in the road again . It was quite dark , and I fancy that the fellow thought that I was a bumpkin , for we did not exchange five words . As he drove off he shoved this into my hand . It is the merest chance that I did not chuck it away , for , feeling that it was a crumpled piece of paper , I imagined that it must be a tradesman 's advertisement or something of the kind . However , as luck would have it , I put it in my pocket , and there I found it when I looked for the dates of our cruise . Now you know as much of the matter as I do . `` Brother and sister stared at the black and white crinkled note with astonishment upon their faces . `` Why , your unknown traveller must have been Monte Cristo , or Rothschild at the least ! '' said Robert . `` I am bound to say , Laura , that I think you have lost your bet . `` `` Oh , I am quite content to lose it . I never heard of such a piece of luck . What a perfectly delightful man this must be to know . `` `` But I ca n't take his money , '' said Hector Spurling , looking somewhat ruefully at the note . `` A little prize-money is all very well in its way , but a Johnny must draw the line somewhere . Besides it must have been a mistake . And yet he meant to give me something big , for he could not mistake a note for a coin . I suppose I must advertise for the fellow . `` `` It seems a pity too , '' remarked Robert . `` I must say that I do n't quite see it in the same light that you do . `` `` Indeed I think that you are very Quixotic , Hector , '' said Laura McIntyre . `` Why should you not accept it in the spirit in which it was meant ? You did this stranger a service -- -perhaps a greater service than you know of -- -and he meant this as a little memento of the occasion . I do not see that there is any possible reason against your keeping it . `` `` Oh , come ! '' said the young sailor , with an embarrassed laugh , `` it is not quite the thing -- -not the sort of story one would care to tell at mess . `` `` In any case you are off to-morrow morning , '' observed Robert . `` You have no time to make inquiries about the mysterious Croesus . You must really make the best of it . `` `` Well , look here , Laura , you put it in your work-basket , '' cried Hector Spurling . `` You shall be my banker , and if the rightful owner turns up then I can refer him to you . If not , I suppose we must look on it as a kind of salvage-money , though I am bound to say I do n't feel entirely comfortable about it . '' He rose to his feet , and threw the note down into the brown basket of coloured wools which stood beside her . `` Now , Laura , I must up anchor , for I promised the governor to be back by nine . It wo n't be long this time
