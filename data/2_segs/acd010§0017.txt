above us were not merely perpendicular , but curved outwards at the top , so that ascent was out of the question . Close to us was the high thin pinnacle of rock which I believe I mentioned earlier in this narrative . It is like a broad red church spire , the top of it being level with the plateau , but a great chasm gaping between . On the summit of it there grew one high tree . Both pinnacle and cliff were comparatively low -- -some five or six hundred feet , I should think . `` It was on that , '' said Professor Challenger , pointing to this tree , `` that the pterodactyl was perched . I climbed half-way up the rock before I shot him . I am inclined to think that a good mountaineer like myself could ascend the rock to the top , though he would , of course , be no nearer to the plateau when he had done so . `` As Challenger spoke of his pterodactyl I glanced at Professor Summerlee , and for the first time I seemed to see some signs of a dawning credulity and repentance . There was no sneer upon his thin lips , but , on the contrary , a gray , drawn look of excitement and amazement . Challenger saw it , too , and reveled in the first taste of victory . `` Of course , '' said he , with his clumsy and ponderous sarcasm , `` Professor Summerlee will understand that when I speak of a pterodactyl I mean a stork -- -only it is the kind of stork which has no feathers , a leathery skin , membranous wings , and teeth in its jaws . '' He grinned and blinked and bowed until his colleague turned and walked away.In the morning , after a frugal breakfast of coffee and manioc -- -we had to be economical of our stores -- -we held a council of war as to the best method of ascending to the plateau above us.Challenger presided with a solemnity as if he were the Lord Chief Justice on the Bench . Picture him seated upon a rock , his absurd boyish straw hat tilted on the back of his head , his supercilious eyes dominating us from under his drooping lids , his great black beard wagging as he slowly defined our present situation and our future movements.Beneath him you might have seen the three of us -- -myself , sunburnt , young , and vigorous after our open-air tramp ; Summerlee , solemn but still critical , behind his eternal pipe ; Lord John , as keen as a razor-edge , with his supple , alert figure leaning upon his rifle , and his eager eyes fixed eagerly upon the speaker . Behind us were grouped the two swarthy half-breeds and the little knot of Indians , while in front and above us towered those huge , ruddy ribs of rocks which kept us from our goal . `` I need not say , '' said our leader , `` that on the occasion of my last visit I exhausted every means of climbing the cliff , and where I failed I do not think that anyone else is likely to succeed , for I am something of a mountaineer . I had none of the appliances of a rock-climber with me , but I have taken the precaution to bring them now . With their aid I am positive I could climb that detached pinnacle to the summit ; but so long as the main cliff overhangs , it is vain to attempt ascending that . I was hurried upon my last visit by the approach of the rainy season and by the exhaustion of my supplies . These considerations limited my time , and I can only claim that I have surveyed about six miles of the cliff to the east of us , finding no possible way up . What , then , shall we now do ? `` `` There seems to be only one reasonable course , '' said Professor Summerlee . `` If you have explored the east , we should travel along the base of the cliff to the west , and seek for a practicable point for our ascent . `` `` That 's it , '' said Lord John . `` The odds are that this plateau is of no great size , and we shall travel round it until we either find an easy way up it , or come back to the point from which we started . `` `` I have already explained to our young friend here , '' said Challenger ( he has a way of alluding to me as if I were a school child ten years old ) , `` that it is quite impossible that there should be an easy way up anywhere , for the simple reason that if there were the summit would not be isolated , and those conditions would not obtain which have effected so singular an interference with the general laws of survival . Yet I admit that there may very well be places where an expert human climber may reach the summit , and yet a cumbrous and heavy animal be unable to descend . It is certain that there is a point where an ascent is possible . `` `` How do you know that , sir ? '' asked Summerlee , sharply . `` Because my predecessor , the American Maple White , actually made such an ascent . How otherwise could he have seen the monster which he sketched in his notebook ? `` `` There you reason somewhat ahead of the proved facts , '' said the stubborn Summerlee . `` I admit your plateau , because I have seen it ; but I have not as yet satisfied myself that it contains any form of life whatever . `` `` What you admit , sir , or what you do not admit , is really of inconceivably small importance . I am glad to perceive that the plateau itself has actually obtruded itself upon your intelligence . '' He glanced up at it , and then , to our amazement , he sprang from his rock , and , seizing Summerlee by the neck , he tilted his face into the air . `` Now sir ! '' he shouted , hoarse with excitement . `` Do I help you to realize that the plateau contains some animal life ? `` I have said that a thick fringe of green overhung the edge of the cliff . Out of this there had emerged a black , glistening object . As it came slowly forth and overhung the chasm , we saw that it was a very large snake with a peculiar flat , spade-like head . It wavered and quivered above us for a minute , the morning sun gleaming upon its sleek , sinuous coils . Then it slowly drew inwards and disappeared.Summerlee had been so interested that he had stood unresisting while Challenger tilted his head into the air . Now he shook his colleague off and came back to his dignity . `` I should be glad , Professor Challenger , '' said he , `` if you could see your way to make any remarks which may occur to you without seizing me by the chin . Even the appearance of a very ordinary rock python does not appear to justify such a liberty . `` `` But there is life upon the plateau all the same , '' his colleague replied in triumph . `` And now , having demonstrated this important conclusion so that it is clear to anyone , however prejudiced or obtuse , I am of opinion that we can not do better than break up our camp and travel to westward until we find some means of ascent . `` The ground at the foot of the cliff was rocky and broken so that the going was slow and difficult . Suddenly we came , however , upon something which cheered our hearts . It was the site of an old encampment , with several empty Chicago meat tins , a bottle labeled `` Brandy , '' a broken tin-opener , and a quantity of other travelers ' debris . A crumpled , disintegrated newspaper revealed itself as the Chicago Democrat , though the date had been obliterated . `` Not mine , '' said Challenger . `` It must be Maple White 's . `` Lord John had been gazing curiously at a great tree-fern which overshadowed the encampment . `` I say , look at this , '' said he . `` I believe it is meant for a sign-post . `` A slip of hard wood had been nailed to the tree in such a way as to point to the westward . `` Most certainly a sign-post , '' said Challenger . `` What else ? Finding himself upon a dangerous errand , our pioneer has left this sign so that any party which follows him may know the way he has taken . Perhaps we shall come upon some other indications as we proceed . `` We did indeed , but they were of a terrible and most unexpected nature . Immediately beneath the cliff there grew a considerable patch of high bamboo , like that which we had traversed in our journey . Many of these stems were twenty feet high , with sharp , strong tops , so that even as they stood they made formidable spears . We were passing along the edge of this cover when my eye was caught by the gleam of something white within it . Thrusting in my head between the stems , I found myself gazing at a fleshless skull . The whole skeleton was there , but the skull had detached itself and lay some feet nearer to the open.With a few blows from the machetes of our Indians we cleared the spot and were able to study the details of this old tragedy . Only a few shreds of clothes could still be distinguished , but there were the remains of boots upon the bony feet , and it was very clear that the dead man was a European . A gold watch by Hudson , of New York , and a chain which held a stylographic pen , lay among the bones . There was also a silver cigarette-case , with `` J. C. , from A. E. S. , '' upon the lid . The state of the metal seemed to show that the catastrophe had occurred no great time before . `` Who can he be ? '' asked Lord John . `` Poor devil ! every bone in his body seems to be broken . `` `` And the bamboo grows through his smashed ribs , '' said Summerlee . `` It is a fast-growing plant , but it is surely inconceivable that this body could have been here while the canes grew to be twenty feet in length . `` `` As to the man 's identity , '' said Professor Challenger , `` I have no doubt whatever upon that point . As I made my way up the river before I reached you at the fazenda I instituted very particular inquiries about Maple White . At Para they knew nothing . Fortunately , I had a definite clew , for there was a particular picture in his sketch-book which showed him taking lunch with a certain ecclesiastic at Rosario . This priest I was able to find , and though he proved a very argumentative fellow , who took it absurdly amiss
