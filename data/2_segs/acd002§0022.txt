Lyons , of equivocal reputation , a long step will have been made towards clearing one incident in this chain of mysteries . I am certainly developing the wisdom of the serpent , for when Mortimer pressed his questions to an inconvenient extent I asked him casually to what type Frankland 's skull belonged , and so heard nothing but craniology for the rest of our drive . I have not lived for years with Sherlock Holmes for nothing.I have only one other incident to record upon this tempestuous and melancholy day . This was my conversation with Barrymore just now , which gives me one more strong card which I can play in due time.Mortimer had stayed to dinner , and he and the baronet played ecarte afterwards . The butler brought me my coffee into the library , and I took the chance to ask him a few questions . `` Well , '' said I , `` has this precious relation of yours departed , or is he still lurking out yonder ? `` `` I do n't know , sir . I hope to heaven that he has gone , for he has brought nothing but trouble here ! I 've not heard of him since I left out food for him last , and that was three days ago . `` `` Did you see him then ? `` `` No , sir , but the food was gone when next I went that way . `` `` Then he was certainly there ? `` `` So you would think , sir , unless it was the other man who took it . `` I sat with my coffee-cup halfway to my lips and stared at Barrymore . `` You know that there is another man then ? `` `` Yes , sir ; there is another man upon the moor . `` `` Have you seen him ? `` `` No , sir . `` `` How do you know of him then ? `` `` Selden told me of him , sir , a week ago or more . He 's in hiding , too , but he 's not a convict as far as I can make out . I do n't like it , Dr. Watson -- -I tell you straight , sir , that I do n't like it . '' He spoke with a sudden passion of earnestness . `` Now , listen to me , Barrymore ! I have no interest in this matter but that of your master . I have come here with no object except to help him . Tell me , frankly , what it is that you do n't like . `` Barrymore hesitated for a moment , as if he regretted his outburst or found it difficult to express his own feelings in words . `` It 's all these goings-on , sir , '' he cried at last , waving his hand towards the rain-lashed window which faced the moor . `` There 's foul play somewhere , and there 's black villainy brewing , to that I 'll swear ! Very glad I should be , sir , to see Sir Henry on his way back to London again ! `` `` But what is it that alarms you ? `` `` Look at Sir Charles 's death ! That was bad enough , for all that the coroner said . Look at the noises on the moor at night . There 's not a man would cross it after sundown if he was paid for it . Look at this stranger hiding out yonder , and watching and waiting ! What 's he waiting for ? What does it mean ? It means no good to anyone of the name of Baskerville , and very glad I shall be to be quit of it all on the day that Sir Henry 's new servants are ready to take over the Hall . `` `` But about this stranger , '' said I . `` Can you tell me anything about him ? What did Selden say ? Did he find out where he hid , or what he was doing ? `` `` He saw him once or twice , but he is a deep one and gives nothing away . At first he thought that he was the police , but soon he found that he had some lay of his own . A kind of gentleman he was , as far as he could see , but what he was doing he could not make out . `` `` And where did he say that he lived ? `` `` Among the old houses on the hillside -- -the stone huts where the old folk used to live . `` `` But how about his food ? `` `` Selden found out that he has got a lad who works for him and brings all he needs . I dare say he goes to Coombe Tracey for what he wants . `` `` Very good , Barrymore . We may talk further of this some other time . '' When the butler had gone I walked over to the black window , and I looked through a blurred pane at the driving clouds and at the tossing outline of the wind-swept trees . It is a wild night indoors , and what must it be in a stone hut upon the moor . What passion of hatred can it be which leads a man to lurk in such a place at such a time ! And what deep and earnest purpose can he have which calls for such a trial ! There , in that hut upon the moor , seems to lie the very centre of that problem which has vexed me so sorely . I swear that another day shall not have passed before I have done all that man can do to reach the heart of the mystery.The extract from my private diary which forms the last chapter has brought my narrative up to the eighteenth of October , a time when these strange events began to move swiftly towards their terrible conclusion . The incidents of the next few days are indelibly graven upon my recollection , and I can tell them without reference to the notes made at the time . I start them from the day which succeeded that upon which I had established two facts of great importance , the one that Mrs. Laura Lyons of Coombe Tracey had written to Sir Charles Baskerville and made an appointment with him at the very place and hour that he met his death , the other that the lurking man upon the moor was to be found among the stone huts upon the hillside . With these two facts in my possession I felt that either my intelligence or my courage must be deficient if I could not throw some further light upon these dark places.I had no opportunity to tell the baronet what I had learned about Mrs. Lyons upon the evening before , for Dr. Mortimer remained with him at cards until it was very late . At breakfast , however , I informed him about my discovery and asked him whether he would care to accompany me to Coombe Tracey . At first he was very eager to come , but on second thoughts it seemed to both of us that if I went alone the results might be better . The more formal we made the visit the less information we might obtain . I left Sir Henry behind , therefore , not without some prickings of conscience , and drove off upon my new quest.When I reached Coombe Tracey I told Perkins to put up the horses , and I made inquiries for the lady whom I had come to interrogate . I had no difficulty in finding her rooms , which were central and well appointed . A maid showed me in without ceremony , and as I entered the sitting-room a lady , who was sitting before a Remington typewriter , sprang up with a pleasant smile of welcome . Her face fell , however , when she saw that I was a stranger , and she sat down again and asked me the object of my visit.The first impression left by Mrs. Lyons was one of extreme beauty . Her eyes and hair were of the same rich hazel colour , and her cheeks , though considerably freckled , were flushed with the exquisite bloom of the brunette , the dainty pink which lurks at the heart of the sulphur rose . Admiration was , I repeat , the first impression . But the second was criticism . There was something subtly wrong with the face , some coarseness of expression , some hardness , perhaps , of eye , some looseness of lip which marred its perfect beauty . But these , of course , are afterthoughts . At the moment I was simply conscious that I was in the presence of a very handsome woman , and that she was asking me the reasons for my visit . I had not quite understood until that instant how delicate my mission was . `` I have the pleasure , '' said I , `` of knowing your father . `` It was a clumsy introduction , and the lady made me feel it . `` There is nothing in common between my father and me , '' she said . `` I owe him nothing , and his friends are not mine . If it were not for the late Sir Charles Baskerville and some other kind hearts I might have starved for all that my father cared . `` `` It was about the late Sir Charles Baskerville that I have come here to see you . `` The freckles started out on the lady 's face . `` What can I tell you about him ? '' she asked , and her fingers played nervously over the stops of her typewriter . `` You knew him , did you not ? `` `` I have already said that I owe a great deal to his kindness . If I am able to support myself it is largely due to the interest which he took in my unhappy situation . `` `` Did you correspond with him ? `` The lady looked quickly up with an angry gleam in her hazel eyes . `` What is the object of these questions ? '' she asked sharply . `` The object is to avoid a public scandal . It is better that I should ask them here than that the matter should pass outside our control . `` She was silent and her face was still very pale . At last she looked up with something reckless and defiant in her manner . `` Well , I 'll answer , '' she said . `` What are your questions ? `` `` Did you correspond with Sir Charles ? `` `` I certainly wrote to him once or twice to acknowledge his delicacy and his generosity . `` `` Have you the dates of those letters ? '' '' No . `` `` Have you ever met him ? `` `` Yes , once or twice , when he came into Coombe Tracey . He was a very retiring man , and he preferred to do good by stealth . `` `` But if you saw him so seldom and wrote so seldom , how did he know enough about your affairs to be able to help you , as you say that he has done ? `` She met my difficulty with the utmost readiness . `` There were several gentlemen who
