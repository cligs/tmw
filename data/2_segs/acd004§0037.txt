Sir Oliver Buttesthorn . `` I can well remember that in Navarre one day it thundered on the left out of a cloudless sky . We knew that ill would come of it , nor had we long to wait . Only thirteen days after , a haunch of prime venison was carried from my very tent door by the wolves , and on the same day two flasks of old vernage turned sour and muddy . `` `` You may bring my harness from below , '' said Sir Nigel to his squires , `` and also , I pray you , bring up Sir Oliver 's and we shall don it here . Ye may then see to your own gear ; for this day you will , I hope , make a very honorable entrance into the field of chivalry , and prove yourselves to be very worthy and valiant squires . And now , Sir Oliver , as to our dispositions : would it please you that I should order them or will you ? `` `` You , my cockerel , you . By Our Lady ! I am no chicken , but I can not claim to know as much of war as the squire of Sir Walter Manny . Settle the matter to your own liking . `` `` You shall fly your pennon upon the fore part , then , and I upon the poop . For foreguard I shall give you your own forty men , with two-score archers . Two-score men , with my own men-at-arms and squires , will serve as a poop-guard . Ten archers , with thirty shipmen , under the master , may hold the waist while ten lie aloft with stones and arbalests . How like you that ? `` `` Good , by my faith , good ! But here comes my harness , and I must to work , for I can not slip into it as I was wont when first I set my face to the wars . `` Meanwhile there had been bustle and preparation in all parts of the great vessel . The archers stood in groups about the decks , new-stringing their bows , and testing that they were firm at the nocks . Among them moved Aylward and other of the older soldiers , with a few whispered words of precept here and of warning there . `` Stand to it , my hearts of gold , '' said the old bowman as he passed from knot to knot . `` By my hilt ! we are in luck this journey . Bear in mind the old saying of the Company . `` `` What is that , Aylward ? '' cried several , leaning on their bows and laughing at him . `` 'T is the master-bowyer 's rede : 'Every bow well bent . Every shaft well sent . Every stave well nocked . Every string well locked . ' There , with that jingle in his head , a bracer on his left hand , a shooting glove on his right , and a farthing's-worth of wax in his girdle , what more doth a bowman need ? `` `` It would not be amiss , '' said Hordle John , `` if under his girdle he had four farthings'-worth of wine . `` `` Work first , wine afterwards , mon camarade . But it is time that we took our order , for methinks that between the Needle rocks and the Alum cliffs yonder I can catch a glimpse of the topmasts of the galleys . Hewett , Cook , Johnson , Cunningham , your men are of the poop-guard . Thornbury , Walters , Hackett , Baddlesmere , you are with Sir Oliver on the forecastle . Simon , you bide with your lord 's banner ; but ten men must go forward . `` Quietly and promptly the men took their places , lying flat upon their faces on the deck , for such was Sir Nigel 's order . Near the prow was planted Sir Oliver 's spear , with his arms -- -a boar 's head gules upon a field of gold . Close by the stern stood Black Simon with the pennon of the house of Loring . In the waist gathered the Southampton mariners , hairy and burly men , with their jerkins thrown off , their waists braced tight , swords , mallets , and pole-axes in their hands . Their leader , Goodwin Hawtayne , stood upon the poop and talked with Sir Nigel , casting his eye up sometimes at the swelling sail , and then glancing back at the two seamen who held the tiller . `` Pass the word , '' said Sir Nigel , `` that no man shall stand to arms or draw his bow-string until my trumpeter shall sound . It would be well that we should seem to be a merchant-ship from Southampton and appear to flee from them . `` `` We shall see them anon , '' said the master-shipman . `` Ha , said I not so ? There they lie , the water-snakes , in Freshwater Bay ; and mark the reek of smoke from yonder point , where they have been at their devil 's work . See how their shallops pull from the land ! They have seen us and called their men aboard . Now they draw upon the anchor . See them like ants upon the forecastle ! They stoop and heave like handy ship men . But , my fair lord , these are no niefs . I doubt but we have taken in hand more than we can do . Each of these ships is a galeasse , and of the largest and swiftest make . `` `` I would I had your eyes , '' said Sir Nigel , blinking at the pirate galleys . `` They seem very gallant ships , and I trust that we shall have much pleasance from our meeting with them . It would be well to pass the word that we should neither give nor take quarter this day . Have you perchance a priest or friar aboard this ship , Master Hawtayne ? `` `` No , my fair lord . `` `` Well , well , it is no great matter for my Company , for they were all houseled and shriven ere we left Twynham Castle ; and Father Christopher of the Priory gave me his word that they were as fit to march to heaven as to Gascony . But my mind misdoubts me as to these Winchester men who have come with Sir Oliver , for they appear to be a very ungodly crew . Pass the word that the men kneel , and that the under-officers repeat to them the pater , the ave , and the credo . `` With a clank of arms , the rough archers and seamen took to their knees , with bent heads and crossed hands , listening to the hoarse mutter from the file-leaders . It was strange to mark the hush ; so that the lapping of the water , the straining of the sail , and the creaking of the timbers grew louder of a sudden upon the ear . Many of the bowmen had drawn amulets and relics from their bosoms , while he who possessed some more than usually sanctified treasure passed it down the line of his comrades , that all might kiss and reap the virtue.The yellow cog had now shot out from the narrow waters of the Solent , and was plunging and rolling on the long heave of the open channel . The wind blew freshly from the east , with a very keen edge to it ; and the great sail bellied roundly out , laying the vessel over until the water hissed beneath her lee bulwarks . Broad and ungainly , she floundered from wave to wave , dipping her round bows deeply into the blue rollers , and sending the white flakes of foam in a spatter over her decks . On her larboard quarter lay the two dark galleys , which had already hoisted sail , and were shooting out from Freshwater Bay in swift pursuit , their double line of oars giving them a vantage which could not fail to bring them up with any vessel which trusted to sails alone . High and bluff the English cog ; long , black and swift the pirate galleys , like two fierce lean wolves which have seen a lordly and unsuspecting stag walk past their forest lair . `` Shall we turn , my fair lord , or shall we carry on ? '' asked the master-shipman , looking behind him with anxious eyes . `` Nay , we must carry on and play the part of the helpless merchant . `` `` But your pennons ? They will see that we have two knights with us . `` `` Yet it would not be to a knight 's honor or good name to lower his pennon . Let them be , and they will think that we are a wine-ship for Gascony , or that we bear the wool-bales of some mercer of the Staple . Ma foi , but they are very swift ! They swoop upon us like two goshawks on a heron . Is there not some symbol or device upon their sails ? `` `` That on the right , '' said Edricson , `` appears to have the head of an Ethiop upon it . `` `` 'T is the badge of Tete-noire , the Norman , '' cried a seaman-mariner . `` I have seen it before , when he harried us at Winchelsea . He is a wondrous large and strong man , with no ruth for man , woman , or beast . They say that he hath the strength of six ; and , certes , he hath the crimes of six upon his soul . See , now , to the poor souls who swing at either end of his yard-arm ! `` At each end of the yard there did indeed hang the dark figure of a man , jolting and lurching with hideous jerkings of its limbs at every plunge and swoop of the galley . `` By St . Paul ! '' said Sir Nigel , `` and by the help of St. George and Our Lady , it will be a very strange thing if our black-headed friend does not himself swing thence ere he be many hours older . But what is that upon the other galley ? `` `` It is the red cross of Genoa . This Spade-beard is a very noted captain , and it is his boast that there are no seamen and no archers in the world who can compare with those who serve the Doge Boccanegra . `` `` That we shall prove , '' said Goodwin Hawtayne ; `` but it would be well , ere they close with us , to raise up the mantlets and pavises as a screen against their bolts . '' He shouted a hoarse order , and his seamen worked swiftly and silently , heightening the bulwarks and strengthening them . The three ship 's anchors were at Sir Nigel 's command carried into the waist , and tied to the mast , with twenty feet of cable between , each under the care of four seamen . Eight others were stationed with leather water-bags to quench any fire-arrows which might come aboard , while others were sent up the mast , to lie along the yard and drop stones or shoot arrows as the occasion
