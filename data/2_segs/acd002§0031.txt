a cocking pistol . `` Look out ! It 's coming ! `` There was a thin , crisp , continuous patter from somewhere in the heart of that crawling bank . The cloud was within fifty yards of where we lay , and we glared at it , all three , uncertain what horror was about to break from the heart of it . I was at Holmes 's elbow , and I glanced for an instant at his face . It was pale and exultant , his eyes shining brightly in the moonlight . But suddenly they started forward in a rigid , fixed stare , and his lips parted in amazement . At the same instant Lestrade gave a yell of terror and threw himself face downward upon the ground . I sprang to my feet , my inert hand grasping my pistol , my mind paralyzed by the dreadful shape which had sprung out upon us from the shadows of the fog . A hound it was , an enormous coal-black hound , but not such a hound as mortal eyes have ever seen . Fire burst from its open mouth , its eyes glowed with a smouldering glare , its muzzle and hackles and dewlap were outlined in flickering flame . Never in the delirious dream of a disordered brain could anything more savage , more appalling , more hellish be conceived than that dark form and savage face which broke upon us out of the wall of fog.With long bounds the huge black creature was leaping down the track , following hard upon the footsteps of our friend . So paralyzed were we by the apparition that we allowed him to pass before we had recovered our nerve . Then Holmes and I both fired together , and the creature gave a hideous howl , which showed that one at least had hit him . He did not pause , however , but bounded onward . Far away on the path we saw Sir Henry looking back , his face white in the moonlight , his hands raised in horror , glaring helplessly at the frightful thing which was hunting him down . But that cry of pain from the hound had blown all our fears to the winds . If he was vulnerable he was mortal , and if we could wound him we could kill him . Never have I seen a man run as Holmes ran that night . I am reckoned fleet of foot , but he outpaced me as much as I outpaced the little professional . In front of us as we flew up the track we heard scream after scream from Sir Henry and the deep roar of the hound . I was in time to see the beast spring upon its victim , hurl him to the ground , and worry at his throat . But the next instant Holmes had emptied five barrels of his revolver into the creature 's flank . With a last howl of agony and a vicious snap in the air , it rolled upon its back , four feet pawing furiously , and then fell limp upon its side . I stooped , panting , and pressed my pistol to the dreadful , shimmering head , but it was useless to press the trigger . The giant hound was dead.Sir Henry lay insensible where he had fallen . We tore away his collar , and Holmes breathed a prayer of gratitude when we saw that there was no sign of a wound and that the rescue had been in time . Already our friend 's eyelids shivered and he made a feeble effort to move . Lestrade thrust his brandy-flask between the baronet 's teeth , and two frightened eyes were looking up at us . `` My God ! '' he whispered . `` What was it ? What , in heaven 's name , was it ? `` `` It 's dead , whatever it is , '' said Holmes . `` We 've laid the family ghost once and forever . `` In mere size and strength it was a terrible creature which was lying stretched before us . It was not a pure bloodhound and it was not a pure mastiff ; but it appeared to be a combination of the two -- -gaunt , savage , and as large as a small lioness . Even now in the stillness of death , the huge jaws seemed to be dripping with a bluish flame and the small , deep-set , cruel eyes were ringed with fire . I placed my hand upon the glowing muzzle , and as I held them up my own fingers smouldered and gleamed in the darkness . `` Phosphorus , '' I said . `` A cunning preparation of it , '' said Holmes , sniffing at the dead animal . `` There is no smell which might have interfered with his power of scent . We owe you a deep apology , Sir Henry , for having exposed you to this fright . I was prepared for a hound , but not for such a creature as this . And the fog gave us little time to receive him . `` `` You have saved my life . `` `` Having first endangered it . Are you strong enough to stand ? `` `` Give me another mouthful of that brandy and I shall be ready for anything . So ! Now , if you will help me up . What do you propose to do ? `` `` To leave you here . You are not fit for further adventures tonight . If you will wait , one or other of us will go back with you to the Hall . `` He tried to stagger to his feet ; but he was still ghastly pale and trembling in every limb . We helped him to a rock , where he sat shivering with his face buried in his hands . `` We must leave you now , '' said Holmes . `` The rest of our work must be done , and every moment is of importance . We have our case , and now we only want our man . `` It 's a thousand to one against our finding him at the house , '' he continued as we retraced our steps swiftly down the path . `` Those shots must have told him that the game was up . `` `` We were some distance off , and this fog may have deadened them . `` `` He followed the hound to call him off -- -of that you may be certain . No , no , he 's gone by this time ! But we 'll search the house and make sure . `` The front door was open , so we rushed in and hurried from room to room to the amazement of a doddering old manservant , who met us in the passage . There was no light save in the dining-room , but Holmes caught up the lamp and left no corner of the house unexplored . No sign could we see of the man whom we were chasing . On the upper floor , however , one of the bedroom doors was locked . `` There 's someone in here , '' cried Lestrade . `` I can hear a movement . Open this door ! `` A faint moaning and rustling came from within . Holmes struck the door just over the lock with the flat of his foot and it flew open . Pistol in hand , we all three rushed into the room.But there was no sign within it of that desperate and defiant villain whom we expected to see . Instead we were faced by an object so strange and so unexpected that we stood for a moment staring at it in amazement.The room had been fashioned into a small museum , and the walls were lined by a number of glass-topped cases full of that collection of butterflies and moths the formation of which had been the relaxation of this complex and dangerous man . In the centre of this room there was an upright beam , which had been placed at some period as a support for the old worm-eaten baulk of timber which spanned the roof . To this post a figure was tied , so swathed and muffled in the sheets which had been used to secure it that one could not for the moment tell whether it was that of a man or a woman . One towel passed round the throat and was secured at the back of the pillar . Another covered the lower part of the face , and over it two dark eyes -- -eyes full of grief and shame and a dreadful questioning -- -stared back at us . In a minute we had torn off the gag , unswathed the bonds , and Mrs. Stapleton sank upon the floor in front of us . As her beautiful head fell upon her chest I saw the clear red weal of a whiplash across her neck . `` The brute ! '' cried Holmes . `` Here , Lestrade , your brandy-bottle ! Put her in the chair ! She has fainted from ill-usage and exhaustion . `` She opened her eyes again . `` Is he safe ? '' she asked . `` Has he escaped ? `` `` He can not escape us , madam . `` `` No , no , I did not mean my husband . Sir Henry ? Is he safe ? '' '' Yes . `` `` And the hound ? `` `` It is dead . `` She gave a long sigh of satisfaction . `` Thank God ! Thank God ! Oh , this villain ! See how he has treated me ! '' She shot her arms out from her sleeves , and we saw with horror that they were all mottled with bruises . `` But this is nothing -- -nothing ! It is my mind and soul that he has tortured and defiled . I could endure it all , ill-usage , solitude , a life of deception , everything , as long as I could still cling to the hope that I had his love , but now I know that in this also I have been his dupe and his tool . '' She broke into passionate sobbing as she spoke . `` You bear him no good will , madam , '' said Holmes . `` Tell us then where we shall find him . If you have ever aided him in evil , help us now and so atone . `` `` There is but one place where he can have fled , '' she answered . `` There is an old tin mine on an island in the heart of the mire . It was there that he kept his hound and there also he had made preparations so that he might have a refuge . That is where he would fly . `` The fog-bank lay like white wool against the window . Holmes held the lamp towards it . `` See , '' said he . `` No one could find his way into the Grimpen Mire tonight . `` She laughed and clapped her hands . Her eyes and teeth gleamed with fierce merriment . `` He may find his way in , but never out , '' she cried . `` How can he see the guiding wands tonight ? We planted them together , he and I , to mark the pathway through the mire . Oh , if I could only have plucked them
