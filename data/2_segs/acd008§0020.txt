the fresh breezy manner of the old clergyman was a corrective to his own sombre and introspective mood . `` Prut , tut ! '' said he . `` This is very bad -- -very bad indeed ! Mind unhinged , you say , and not likely to get over it ! Dear , dear ! I have noticed a change in him these last few weeks . He looked like a man who had something upon his mind . And how is Mr. Robert McIntyre ? `` `` He is very well . He was with me this morning when his father had this attack. '' '' Ha ! There is a change in that young man . I observe an alteration in him . You will forgive me , Mr. Raffles Haw , if I say a few serious words of advice to you . Apart from my spiritual functions I am old enough to be your father . You are a very wealthy man , and you have used your wealth nobly -- -yes , sir , nobly . I do not think that there is a man in a thousand who would have done as well . But do n't you think sometimes that it has a dangerous influence upon those who are around you ? `` `` I have sometimes feared so . '' `` We may pass over old Mr. McIntyre . It would hardly be just , perhaps , to mention him in this connection . But there is Robert . He used to take such an interest in his profession . He was so keen about art . If you met him , the first words he said were usually some reference to his plans , or the progress he was making in his latest picture . He was ambitious , pushing , self-reliant . Now he does nothing . I know for a fact that it is two months since he put brush to canvas . He has turned from a student into an idler , and , what is worse , I fear into a parasite . You will forgive me for speaking so plainly ? `` Raffles Haw said nothing , but he threw out his hands with a gesture of pain . `` And then there is something to be said about the country folk , '' said the vicar . `` Your kindness has been , perhaps , a little indiscriminate there . They do n't seem to be as helpful or as self-reliant as they used . There was old Blaxton , whose cowhouse roof was blown off the other day . He used to be a man who was full of energy and resource . Three months ago he would have got a ladder and had that roof on again in two days ' work . But now he must sit down , and wring his hands , and write letters , because he knew that it would come to your ears , and that you would make it good . There 's old Ellary , too ! Well , of course he was always poor , but at least he did something , and so kept himself out of mischief . Not a stroke will he do now , but smokes and talks scandal from morning to night . And the worst of it is , that it not only hurts those who have had your help , but it unsettles those who have not . They all have an injured , surly feeling as if other folk were getting what they had an equal right to . It has really come to such a pitch that I thought it was a duty to speak to you about it . Well , it is a new experience to me . I have often had to reprove my parishioners for not being charitable enough , but it is very strange to find one who is too charitable . It is a noble error . `` `` I thank you very much for letting me know about it , '' answered Raffles Haw , as he shook the good old clergyman 's hand . `` I shall certainly reconsider my conduct in that respect . `` He kept a rigid and unmoved face until his visitor had gone , and then retiring to his own little room , he threw himself upon the bed and burst out sobbing with his face buried in the pillow . Of all men in England , this , the richest , was on that day the most miserable . How could he use this great power which he held ? Every blessing which he tried to give turned itself into a curse . His intentions were so good , and yet the results were so terrible . It was as if he had some foul leprosy of the mind which all caught who were exposed to his influence . His charity , so well meant , so carefully bestowed , had yet poisoned the whole countryside . And if in small things his results were so evil , how could he tell that they would be better in the larger plans which he had formed ? If he could not pay the debts of a simple yokel without disturbing the great laws of cause and effect which lie at the base of all things , what could he hope for when he came to fill the treasury of nations , to interfere with the complex conditions of trade , or to provide for great masses of the population ? He drew back with horror as he dimly saw that vast problems faced him in which he might make errors which all his money could not repair . The way of Providence was the straight way . Yet he , a half-blind creature , must needs push in and strive to alter and correct it . Would he be a benefactor ? Might he not rather prove to be the greatest malefactor that the world had seen ? But soon a calmer mood came upon him , and he rose and bathed his flushed face and fevered brow . After all , was not there a field where all were agreed that money might be well spent ? It was not the way of nature , but rather the way of man which he would alter . It was not Providence that had ordained that folk should live half-starved and overcrowded in dreary slums . That was the result of artificial conditions , and it might well be healed by artificial means . Why should not his plans be successful after all , and the world better for his discovery ? Then again , it was not the truth that he cast a blight on those with whom he was brought in contact . There was Laura ; who knew more of him than she did , and yet how good and sweet and true she was ! She at least had lost nothing through knowing him . He would go down and see her . It would be soothing to hear her voice , and to turn to her for words of sympathy in this his hour of darkness.The storm had died away , but a soft wind was blowing , and the smack of the coming spring was in the air . He drew in the aromatic scent of the fir-trees as he passed down the curving drive . Before him lay the long sloping countryside , all dotted over with the farmsteadings and little red cottages , with the morning sun striking slantwise upon their grey roofs and glimmering windows . His heart yearned over all these people with their manifold troubles , their little sordid miseries , their strivings and hopings and petty soul-killing cares . How could he get at them ? How could he manage to lift the burden from them , and yet not hinder them in their life aim ? For more and more could he see that all refinement is through sorrow , and that the life which does not refine is the life without an aim.Laura was alone in the sitting-room at Elmdene , for Robert had gone out to make some final arrangements about his father . She sprang up as her lover entered , and ran forward with a pretty girlish gesture to greet him . `` Oh , Raffles ! '' she cried , `` I knew that you would come . Is it not dreadful about papa ? `` `` You must not fret , dearest , '' he answered gently . `` It may not prove to be so very grave after all . `` `` But it all happened before I was stirring . I knew nothing about it until breakfast-time . They must have gone up to the Hall very early . `` `` Yes , they did come up rather early . `` `` What is the matter with you , Raffles ? '' cried Laura , looking up into his face . `` You look so sad and weary ! `` `` I have been a little in the blues . The fact is , Laura , that I have had a long talk with Mr. Spurling this morning . `` The girl started , and turned white to the lips . A long talk with Mr. Spurling ! Did that mean that he had learned her secret ? '' Well ? '' she gasped . `` He tells me that my charity has done more harm than good , and in fact , that I have had an evil influence upon every one whom I have come near . He said it in the most delicate way , but that was really what it amounted to . `` `` Oh , is that all ? '' said Laura , with a long sigh of relief . `` You must not think of minding what Mr. Spurling says . Why , it is absurd on the face of it ! Everybody knows that there are dozens of men all over the country who would have been ruined and turned out of their houses if you had not stood their friend . How could they be the worse for having known you ? I wonder that Mr. Spurling can talk such nonsense ! `` `` How is Robert 's picture getting on ? `` `` Oh , he has a lazy fit on him . He has not touched it for ever so long . But why do you ask that ? You have that furrow on your brow again . Put it away , sir ! `` She smoothed it away with her little white hand . `` Well , at any rate , I do n't think that quite everybody is the worse , '' said he , looking down at her . `` There is one , at least , who is beyond taint , one who is good , and pure , and true , and who would love me as well if I were a poor clerk struggling for a livelihood . You would , would you not , Laura ? `` `` You foolish boy ! of course I would . `` `` And yet how strange it is that it should be so . That you , who are the only woman whom I have ever loved , should be the only one in whom I also have raised an affection which is free from greed or interest . I wonder whether you may not have been sent by Providence simply to restore my confidence in the world . How barren a place would it not be if it were not for woman 's love !
