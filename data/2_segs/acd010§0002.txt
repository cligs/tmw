was just after eleven , and the big room was fairly full , though the rush had not yet set in . I noticed a tall , thin , angular man seated in an arm-chair by the fire . He turned as I drew my chair up to him . It was the man of all others whom I should have chosen -- -Tarp Henry , of the staff of Nature , a thin , dry , leathery creature , who was full , to those who knew him , of kindly humanity . I plunged instantly into my subject . `` What do you know of Professor Challenger ? '' '' Challenger ? '' He gathered his brows in scientific disapproval . `` Challenger was the man who came with some cock-and-bull story from South America . `` `` What story ? `` `` Oh , it was rank nonsense about some queer animals he had discovered . I believe he has retracted since . Anyhow , he has suppressed it all . He gave an interview to Reuter 's , and there was such a howl that he saw it would n't do . It was a discreditable business . There were one or two folk who were inclined to take him seriously , but he soon choked them off. '' '' How ? `` `` Well , by his insufferable rudeness and impossible behavior . There was poor old Wadley , of the Zoological Institute . Wadley sent a message : 'The President of the Zoological Institute presents his compliments to Professor Challenger , and would take it as a personal favor if he would do them the honor to come to their next meeting . ' The answer was unprintable . `` `` You do n't say ? `` `` Well , a bowdlerized version of it would run : 'Professor Challenger presents his compliments to the President of the Zoological Institute , and would take it as a personal favor if he would go to the devil . ' '' '' Good Lord ! `` `` Yes , I expect that 's what old Wadley said . I remember his wail at the meeting , which began : 'In fifty years experience of scientific intercourse -- -- -- ' It quite broke the old man up . `` `` Anything more about Challenger ? `` `` Well , I 'm a bacteriologist , you know . I live in a nine-hundred-diameter microscope . I can hardly claim to take serious notice of anything that I can see with my naked eye . I 'm a frontiersman from the extreme edge of the Knowable , and I feel quite out of place when I leave my study and come into touch with all you great , rough , hulking creatures . I 'm too detached to talk scandal , and yet at scientific conversaziones I HAVE heard something of Challenger , for he is one of those men whom nobody can ignore . He 's as clever as they make 'em -- -a full-charged battery of force and vitality , but a quarrelsome , ill-conditioned faddist , and unscrupulous at that . He had gone the length of faking some photographs over the South American business . `` `` You say he is a faddist . What is his particular fad ? `` `` He has a thousand , but the latest is something about Weissmann and Evolution . He had a fearful row about it in Vienna , I believe . `` `` Ca n't you tell me the point ? `` `` Not at the moment , but a translation of the proceedings exists . We have it filed at the office . Would you care to come ? `` `` It 's just what I want . I have to interview the fellow , and I need some lead up to him . It 's really awfully good of you to give me a lift . I 'll go with you now , if it is not too late . `` Half an hour later I was seated in the newspaper office with a huge tome in front of me , which had been opened at the article `` Weissmann versus Darwin , '' with the sub heading , `` Spirited Protest at Vienna . Lively Proceedings . '' My scientific education having been somewhat neglected , I was unable to follow the whole argument , but it was evident that the English Professor had handled his subject in a very aggressive fashion , and had thoroughly annoyed his Continental colleagues . `` Protests , '' `` Uproar , '' and `` General appeal to the Chairman '' were three of the first brackets which caught my eye . Most of the matter might have been written in Chinese for any definite meaning that it conveyed to my brain . `` I wish you could translate it into English for me , '' I said , pathetically , to my help-mate . `` Well , it is a translation . `` `` Then I 'd better try my luck with the original . `` `` It is certainly rather deep for a layman . `` `` If I could only get a single good , meaty sentence which seemed to convey some sort of definite human idea , it would serve my turn . Ah , yes , this one will do . I seem in a vague way almost to understand it . I 'll copy it out . This shall be my link with the terrible Professor . `` `` Nothing else I can do ? `` `` Well , yes ; I propose to write to him . If I could frame the letter here , and use your address it would give atmosphere . `` `` We 'll have the fellow round here making a row and breaking the furniture . `` `` No , no ; you 'll see the letter -- -nothing contentious , I assure you . `` `` Well , that 's my chair and desk . You 'll find paper there . I 'd like to censor it before it goes . `` It took some doing , but I flatter myself that it was n't such a bad job when it was finished . I read it aloud to the critical bacteriologist with some pride in my handiwork . `` DEAR PROFESSOR CHALLENGER , '' it said , `` As a humble student of Nature , I have always taken the most profound interest in your speculations as to the differences between Darwin and Weissmann . I have recently had occasion to refresh my memory by re-reading -- -- -- '' '' You infernal liar ! '' murmured Tarp Henry. -- - '' by re-reading your masterly address at Vienna . That lucid and admirable statement seems to be the last word in the matter . There is one sentence in it , however -- -namely : 'I protest strongly against the insufferable and entirely dogmatic assertion that each separate id is a microcosm possessed of an historical architecture elaborated slowly through the series of generations . ' Have you no desire , in view of later research , to modify this statement ? Do you not think that it is over-accentuated ? With your permission , I would ask the favor of an interview , as I feel strongly upon the subject , and have certain suggestions which I could only elaborate in a personal conversation . With your consent , I trust to have the honor of calling at eleven o'clock the day after to-morrow ( Wednesday ) morning . `` I remain , Sir , with assurances of profound respect , yours very truly , EDWARD D . MALONE . `` `` How 's that ? '' I asked , triumphantly . `` Well if your conscience can stand it -- -- -- '' '' It has never failed me yet . `` `` But what do you mean to do ? `` `` To get there . Once I am in his room I may see some opening . I may even go the length of open confession . If he is a sportsman he will be tickled . `` `` Tickled , indeed ! He 's much more likely to do the tickling . Chain mail , or an American football suit -- -that 's what you 'll want . Well , good-bye . I 'll have the answer for you here on Wednesday morning -- -if he ever deigns to answer you . He is a violent , dangerous , cantankerous character , hated by everyone who comes across him , and the butt of the students , so far as they dare take a liberty with him . Perhaps it would be best for you if you never heard from the fellow at all . `` My friend 's fear or hope was not destined to be realized . When I called on Wednesday there was a letter with the West Kensington postmark upon it , and my name scrawled across the envelope in a handwriting which looked like a barbed-wire railing . The contents were as follows : -- - '' ENMORE PARK , W. '' SIR , -- -I have duly received your note , in which you claim to endorse my views , although I am not aware that they are dependent upon endorsement either from you or anyone else . You have ventured to use the word 'speculation ' with regard to my statement upon the subject of Darwinism , and I would call your attention to the fact that such a word in such a connection is offensive to a degree . The context convinces me , however , that you have sinned rather through ignorance and tactlessness than through malice , so I am content to pass the matter by . You quote an isolated sentence from my lecture , and appear to have some difficulty in understanding it . I should have thought that only a sub-human intelligence could have failed to grasp the point , but if it really needs amplification I shall consent to see you at the hour named , though visits and visitors of every sort are exceeding distasteful to me . As to your suggestion that I may modify my opinion , I would have you know that it is not my habit to do so after a deliberate expression of my mature views . You will kindly show the envelope of this letter to my man , Austin , when you call , as he has to take every precaution to shield me from the intrusive rascals who call themselves 'journalists . ' '' Yours faithfully , '' GEORGE EDWARD CHALLENGER . `` This was the letter that I read aloud to Tarp Henry , who had come down early to hear the result of my venture . His only remark was , `` There 's some new stuff , cuticura or something , which is better than arnica . '' Some people have such extraordinary notions of humor.It was nearly half-past ten before I had received my message , but a taxicab took me round in good time for my appointment . It was an imposing porticoed house at which we stopped , and the heavily-curtained windows gave every indication of wealth upon the part of this formidable Professor . The door was opened by an odd , swarthy , dried-up person of uncertain age , with a dark pilot jacket and brown leather gaiters . I found afterwards that he was the chauffeur , who filled the gaps left by a succession of fugitive butlers . He looked me up and down with a searching light blue eye. '' Expected ?
