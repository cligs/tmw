These were hidden fires , indeed ! `` A beard ! A beard ! The man has a beard ! `` `` A beard ? `` `` It is not the baronet -- -it is -- -why , it is my neighbour , the convict ! `` With feverish haste we had turned the body over , and that dripping beard was pointing up to the cold , clear moon . There could be no doubt about the beetling forehead , the sunken animal eyes . It was indeed the same face which had glared upon me in the light of the candle from over the rock -- -the face of Selden , the criminal.Then in an instant it was all clear to me . I remembered how the baronet had told me that he had handed his old wardrobe to Barrymore . Barrymore had passed it on in order to help Selden in his escape . Boots , shirt , cap -- -it was all Sir Henry 's . The tragedy was still black enough , but this man had at least deserved death by the laws of his country . I told Holmes how the matter stood , my heart bubbling over with thankfulness and joy . `` Then the clothes have been the poor devil 's death , '' said he . `` It is clear enough that the hound has been laid on from some article of Sir Henry 's -- -the boot which was abstracted in the hotel , in all probability -- -and so ran this man down . There is one very singular thing , however : How came Selden , in the darkness , to know that the hound was on his trail ? `` `` He heard him . `` `` To hear a hound upon the moor would not work a hard man like this convict into such a paroxysm of terror that he would risk recapture by screaming wildly for help . By his cries he must have run a long way after he knew the animal was on his track . How did he know ? `` `` A greater mystery to me is why this hound , presuming that all our conjectures are correct -- - '' '' I presume nothing . `` `` Well , then , why this hound should be loose tonight . I suppose that it does not always run loose upon the moor . Stapleton would not let it go unless he had reason to think that Sir Henry would be there . `` `` My difficulty is the more formidable of the two , for I think that we shall very shortly get an explanation of yours , while mine may remain forever a mystery . The question now is , what shall we do with this poor wretch 's body ? We can not leave it here to the foxes and the ravens . `` `` I suggest that we put it in one of the huts until we can communicate with the police. '' '' Exactly . I have no doubt that you and I could carry it so far . Halloa , Watson , what 's this ? It 's the man himself , by all that 's wonderful and audacious ! Not a word to show your suspicions -- -not a word , or my plans crumble to the ground . `` A figure was approaching us over the moor , and I saw the dull red glow of a cigar . The moon shone upon him , and I could distinguish the dapper shape and jaunty walk of the naturalist . He stopped when he saw us , and then came on again . `` Why , Dr. Watson , that 's not you , is it ? You are the last man that I should have expected to see out on the moor at this time of night . But , dear me , what 's this ? Somebody hurt ? Not -- -do n't tell me that it is our friend Sir Henry ! '' He hurried past me and stooped over the dead man . I heard a sharp intake of his breath and the cigar fell from his fingers . `` Who -- -who 's this ? '' he stammered . `` It is Selden , the man who escaped from Princetown . `` Stapleton turned a ghastly face upon us , but by a supreme effort he had overcome his amazement and his disappointment . He looked sharply from Holmes to me . `` Dear me ! What a very shocking affair ! How did he die ? `` `` He appears to have broken his neck by falling over these rocks . My friend and I were strolling on the moor when we heard a cry . `` `` I heard a cry also . That was what brought me out . I was uneasy about Sir Henry . `` `` Why about Sir Henry in particular ? '' I could not help asking . `` Because I had suggested that he should come over . When he did not come I was surprised , and I naturally became alarmed for his safety when I heard cries upon the moor . By the way '' -- -his eyes darted again from my face to Holmes 's -- - '' did you hear anything else besides a cry ? `` `` No , '' said Holmes ; `` did you ? '' '' No . `` `` What do you mean , then ? `` `` Oh , you know the stories that the peasants tell about a phantom hound , and so on . It is said to be heard at night upon the moor . I was wondering if there were any evidence of such a sound tonight . `` `` We heard nothing of the kind , '' said I . `` And what is your theory of this poor fellow 's death ? `` `` I have no doubt that anxiety and exposure have driven him off his head . He has rushed about the moor in a crazy state and eventually fallen over here and broken his neck . `` `` That seems the most reasonable theory , '' said Stapleton , and he gave a sigh which I took to indicate his relief . `` What do you think about it , Mr. Sherlock Holmes ? `` My friend bowed his compliments . `` You are quick at identification , '' said he . `` We have been expecting you in these parts since Dr. Watson came down . You are in time to see a tragedy . `` `` Yes , indeed . I have no doubt that my friend 's explanation will cover the facts . I will take an unpleasant remembrance back to London with me tomorrow . `` `` Oh , you return tomorrow ? `` `` That is my intention . `` `` I hope your visit has cast some light upon those occurrences which have puzzled us ? `` Holmes shrugged his shoulders . `` One can not always have the success for which one hopes . An investigator needs facts and not legends or rumours . It has not been a satisfactory case . `` My friend spoke in his frankest and most unconcerned manner . Stapleton still looked hard at him . Then he turned to me . `` I would suggest carrying this poor fellow to my house , but it would give my sister such a fright that I do not feel justified in doing it . I think that if we put something over his face he will be safe until morning . `` And so it was arranged . Resisting Stapleton 's offer of hospitality , Holmes and I set off to Baskerville Hall , leaving the naturalist to return alone . Looking back we saw the figure moving slowly away over the broad moor , and behind him that one black smudge on the silvered slope which showed where the man was lying who had come so horribly to his end . `` We 're at close grips at last , '' said Holmes as we walked together across the moor . `` What a nerve the fellow has ! How he pulled himself together in the face of what must have been a paralyzing shock when he found that the wrong man had fallen a victim to his plot . I told you in London , Watson , and I tell you now again , that we have never had a foeman more worthy of our steel . `` `` I am sorry that he has seen you . `` `` And so was I at first . But there was no getting out of it . `` `` What effect do you think it will have upon his plans now that he knows you are here ? `` `` It may cause him to be more cautious , or it may drive him to desperate measures at once . Like most clever criminals , he may be too confident in his own cleverness and imagine that he has completely deceived us . `` `` Why should we not arrest him at once ? `` `` My dear Watson , you were born to be a man of action . Your instinct is always to do something energetic . But supposing , for argument 's sake , that we had him arrested tonight , what on earth the better off should we be for that ? We could prove nothing against him . There 's the devilish cunning of it ! If he were acting through a human agent we could get some evidence , but if we were to drag this great dog to the light of day it would not help us in putting a rope round the neck of its master . `` `` Surely we have a case . `` `` Not a shadow of one -- -only surmise and conjecture . We should be laughed out of court if we came with such a story and such evidence . `` `` There is Sir Charles 's death . `` `` Found dead without a mark upon him . You and I know that he died of sheer fright , and we know also what frightened him , but how are we to get twelve stolid jurymen to know it ? What signs are there of a hound ? Where are the marks of its fangs ? Of course we know that a hound does not bite a dead body and that Sir Charles was dead before ever the brute overtook him . But we have to prove all this , and we are not in a position to do it . `` `` Well , then , tonight ? `` `` We are not much better off tonight . Again , there was no direct connection between the hound and the man 's death . We never saw the hound . We heard it , but we could not prove that it was running upon this man 's trail . There is a complete absence of motive . No , my dear fellow ; we must reconcile ourselves to the fact that we have no case at present , and that it is worth our while to run any risk in order to establish one . `` `` And how do you propose to do so ? `` `` I have great hopes of what Mrs. Laura Lyons may do for us when the position of affairs is made clear to her . And I have my own plan as well . Sufficient for tomorrow is the evil thereof ; but I hope before the day
