them . `` `` And so you shall , mon petit , '' replied the archer . `` I have not heard a man speak better since old Dom Bertrand died , who was at one time chaplain to the White Company . He was a very valiant man , but at the battle of Brignais he was spitted through the body by a Hainault man-at-arms . For this we had an excommunication read against the man , when next we saw our holy father at Avignon ; but as we had not his name , and knew nothing of him , save that he rode a dapple-gray roussin , I have feared sometimes that the blight may have settled upon the wrong man . `` `` Your Company has been , then , to bow knee before our holy father , the Pope Urban , the prop and centre of Christendom ? '' asked Alleyne , much interested . `` Perchance you have yourself set eyes upon his august face ? `` `` Twice I saw him , '' said the archer . `` He was a lean little rat of a man , with a scab on his chin . The first time we had five thousand crowns out of him , though he made much ado about it . The second time we asked ten thousand , but it was three days before we could come to terms , and I am of opinion myself that we might have done better by plundering the palace . His chamberlain and cardinals came forth , as I remember , to ask whether we would take seven thousand crowns with his blessing and a plenary absolution , or the ten thousand with his solemn ban by bell , book and candle . We were all of one mind that it was best to have the ten thousand with the curse ; but in some way they prevailed upon Sir John , so that we were blest and shriven against our will . Perchance it is as well , for the Company were in need of it about that time . `` The pious Alleyne was deeply shocked by this reminiscence . Involuntarily he glanced up and around to see if there were any trace of those opportune levin-flashes and thunderbolts which , in the `` Acta Sanctorum , '' were wont so often to cut short the loose talk of the scoffer . The autumn sun streamed down as brightly as ever , and the peaceful red path still wound in front of them through the rustling , yellow-tinted forest , Nature seemed to be too busy with her own concerns to heed the dignity of an outraged pontiff . Yet he felt a sense of weight and reproach within his breast , as though he had sinned himself in giving ear to such words . The teachings of twenty years cried out against such license . It was not until he had thrown himself down before one of the many wayside crosses , and had prayed from his heart both for the archer and for himself , that the dark cloud rolled back again from his spirit.His companions had passed on whilst he was at his orisons ; but his young blood and the fresh morning air both invited him to a scamper . His staff in one hand and his scrip in the other , with springy step and floating locks , he raced along the forest path , as active and as graceful as a young deer . He had not far to go , however ; for , on turning a corner , he came on a roadside cottage with a wooden fence-work around it , where stood big John and Aylward the bowman , staring at something within . As he came up with them , he saw that two little lads , the one about nine years of age and the other somewhat older , were standing on the plot in front of the cottage , each holding out a round stick in their left hands , with their arms stiff and straight from the shoulder , as silent and still as two small statues . They were pretty , blue-eyed , yellow-haired lads , well made and sturdy , with bronzed skins , which spoke of a woodland life . `` Here are young chips from an old bow stave ! '' cried the soldier in great delight . `` This is the proper way to raise children . By my hilt ! I could not have trained them better had I the ordering of it myself . `` `` What is it then ? '' asked Hordle John . `` They stand very stiff , and I trust that they have not been struck so . `` `` Nay , they are training their left arms , that they may have a steady grasp of the bow . So my own father trained me , and six days a week I held out his walking-staff till my arm was heavy as lead . Hola , mes enfants ! how long will you hold out ? `` `` Until the sun is over the great lime-tree , good master , '' the elder answered . `` What would ye be , then ? Woodmen ? Verderers ? `` `` Nay , soldiers , '' they cried both together . `` By the beard of my father ! but ye are whelps of the true breed . Why so keen , then , to be soldiers ? `` `` That we may fight the Scots , '' they answered . `` Daddy will send us to fight the Scots . `` `` And why the Scots , my pretty lads ? We have seen French and Spanish galleys no further away than Southampton , but I doubt that it will be some time before the Scots find their way to these parts . `` `` Our business is with the Scots , '' quoth the elder ; `` for it was the Scots who cut off daddy 's string fingers and his thumbs . `` `` Aye , lads , it was that , '' said a deep voice from behind Alleyne 's shoulder . Looking round , the wayfarers saw a gaunt , big-boned man , with sunken cheeks and a sallow face , who had come up behind them . He held up his two hands as he spoke , and showed that the thumbs and two first fingers had been torn away from each of them . `` Ma foi , camarade ! '' cried Aylward . `` Who hath served thee in so shameful a fashion ? `` `` It is easy to see , friend , that you were born far from the marches of Scotland , '' quoth the stranger , with a bitter smile . `` North of Humber there is no man who would not know the handiwork of Devil Douglas , the black Lord James . `` `` And how fell you into his hands ? '' asked John . `` I am a man of the north country , from the town of Beverley and the wapentake of Holderness , '' he answered . `` There was a day when , from Trent to Tweed , there was no better marksman than Robin Heathcot . Yet , as you see , he hath left me , as he hath left many another poor border archer , with no grip for bill or bow . Yet the king hath given me a living here in the southlands , and please God these two lads of mine will pay off a debt that hath been owing over long . What is the price of daddy 's thumbs , boys ? `` `` Twenty Scottish lives , '' they answered together . `` And for the fingers ? `` `` Half a score . `` `` When they can bend my war-bow , and bring down a squirrel at a hundred paces , I send them to take service under Johnny Copeland , the Lord of the Marches and Governor of Carlisle . By my soul ! I would give the rest of my fingers to see the Douglas within arrow-flight of them . `` `` May you live to see it , '' quoth the bowman . `` And hark ye , mes enfants , take an old soldier 's rede and lay your bodies to the bow , drawing from hip and thigh as much as from arm . Learn also , I pray you , to shoot with a dropping shaft ; for though a bowman may at times be called upon to shoot straight and fast , yet it is more often that he has to do with a town-guard behind a wall , or an arbalestier with his mantlet raised when you can not hope to do him scathe unless your shaft fall straight upon him from the clouds . I have not drawn string for two weeks , but I may be able to show ye how such shots should be made . '' He loosened his long-bow , slung his quiver round to the front , and then glanced keenly round for a fitting mark . There was a yellow and withered stump some way off , seen under the drooping branches of a lofty oak . The archer measured the distance with his eye ; and then , drawing three shafts , he shot them off with such speed that the first had not reached the mark ere the last was on the string . Each arrow passed high over the oak ; and , of the three , two stuck fair into the stump ; while the third , caught in some wandering puff of wind , was driven a foot or two to one side. '' Good ! '' cried the north countryman . `` Hearken to him lads ! He is a master bowman . Your dad says amen to every word he says . `` `` By my hilt ! '' said Aylward , `` if I am to preach on bowmanship , the whole long day would scarce give me time for my sermon . We have marksmen in the Company who will notch with a shaft every crevice and joint of a man-at-arm 's harness , from the clasp of his bassinet to the hinge of his greave . But , with your favor , friend , I must gather my arrows again , for while a shaft costs a penny a poor man can scarce leave them sticking in wayside stumps . We must , then , on our road again , and I hope from my heart that you may train these two young goshawks here until they are ready for a cast even at such a quarry as you speak of . `` Leaving the thumbless archer and his brood , the wayfarers struck through the scattered huts of Emery Down , and out on to the broad rolling heath covered deep in ferns and in heather , where droves of the half-wild black forest pigs were rooting about amongst the hillocks . The woods about this point fall away to the left and the right , while the road curves upwards and the wind sweeps keenly over the swelling uplands . The broad strips of bracken glowed red and yellow against the black peaty soil , and a queenly doe who grazed among them turned her white front and her great questioning eyes towards the wayfarers . Alleyne gazed in admiration at the supple beauty of the creature ; but the archer 's fingers played with his quiver , and his eyes glistened with the fell instinct which urges
