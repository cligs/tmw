we were n't over and above sure o ' ourselves . She was n't much of a sea-going craft when we left England , but the sun had fried all the pitch out o ' her seams , and you might ha ' put your finger through some of them . Two days an ' a night we were at the pumps , for she leaked like a sieve . We lost the fore topsail , blown clean out o ' the ringbolts . I never thought to see Lunnon again . `` `` If she could weather a gale like that she could make another voyage . `` `` She could start on another , '' the sailor said gloomily , `` but as like as not she 'd never see the end o't . `` `` Come , come , you 're not quite yourself this morning , Miggs . We value you as a dashing , fearless fellow -- -let me fill your glass again -- -who does n't fear a little risk where there 's something to be gained . You 'll lose your good name if you go on like that . `` `` She 's in a terrible bad way , '' the captain insisted . `` You 'll have to do something before she can go . `` `` What shall we have to do ? `` `` Dry dock her and give her a thorough overhaul . She might sink before she got out o ' the Channel if she went as she is just now . `` `` Very well , '' the merchant said coldly . `` If you insist on it , it must be done . But , of course , it would make a great difference in your salary. '' '' Eh ? `` `` You are at present getting fifteen pounds a month , and five per cent . commission . These are exceptional terms in consideration of any risk that you may run . We shall dry dock theBlack Eagle , and your salary is now ten pounds a month and two and a half commission . `` `` Belay , there , belay ! '' the sailor shouted . His coppery face was a shade darker than usual , and his bilious eyes had a venomous gleam in them . `` Do n't you beat me down , curse you ! '' he hissed , advancing to the table and leaning his hands upon it while he pushed his angry face forward until it was within a foot of that of the merchant . `` Do n't you try that game on , mate , for I am a free-born British seaman , and I am under the thumb of no man . `` `` You 're drunk , '' said the senior partner . `` Sit down ! `` `` You 'd reduce my screw , would ye ? '' roared Captain Hamilton Miggs , working himself into a fury . `` Me that has worked for ye , and slaved for ye , and risked my life for ye . You try it on , guv'nor ; just you try it on ! Suppose I let out that little story o ' the painting out o ' the marks -- -where would the firm of Girdlestone be then ! I guess you 'd rather double my wage than have that yarn goin ' about . `` `` What do you mean ? `` `` What do I mean ? You do n't know what I mean , do you ? Of course not.It was n't you as set us on to go at night and paint out the GovernmentPlimsoll marks and then paint 'em in again higher up , so as to be ableto overload . That was n't you , was it ? `` `` Do you mean to assert that it was ? `` `` In course I do , '' thundered the angry seaman.The senior partner struck the gong which stood upon the table . `` Gilray , '' he said quietly , `` go out and bring in a policeman . `` Captain Hamilton Miggs seemed to be somewhat startled by this sudden move of his antagonist . `` Steady your helm , governor , '' he said . `` What are ye up to now ? `` `` I 'm going to give you in charge . `` `` What for ? `` `` For intimidation and using threatening language , and endeavouring to extort money under false pretences . `` `` There 's no witnesses , '' the sailor said in a half-cringing , half-defiant manner . `` Oh yes , there are , '' Ezra Girdlestone remarked , coming into the room . He had been standing between the two doors which led to the counting-house , and had overheard the latter portion of the conversation . `` Do n't let me interrupt you . You were saying that you would blacken my father 's character unless he increased your salary . `` `` I did n't mean no harm , '' said Captain Hamilton Miggs , glancing nervously from the one to the other . He had been fairly well known to the law in his younger days , and had no desire to renew the acquaintance . `` Who painted out those Plimsoll marks ? '' asked the merchant . `` It was me . `` `` Did any one suggest it to you ? '' '' No . `` `` Shall I send in the policeman , sir ? '' asked Gilray , opening the door . `` Ask him to wait for a moment , '' Girdlestone answered . `` And now , captain , to return to the original point , shall we dry dock theBlack Eagleand reduce the salary , or do you see your way to going back in her on the same terms ? `` `` I 'll go back and be damned to it ! '' said the captain recklessly , plunging his hands into the pockets of his pea jacket and plumping back into his chair . `` That 's right , '' his grim employer remarked approvingly . `` But swearing is a most sinful practice . Send the policeman away , Ezra . `` The young man went out with an amused smile , and the two were left together again . `` You 'll not be able to pass the Government inspector unless you do something to her , '' the seaman said after a long pause , during which he brooded over his wrongs . `` Of course we shall do something . The firm is not mean , though it avoids unnecessary expense . We 'll put a coat of paint on her , and some pitch , and do up the rigging . She 's a stout old craft , and with one of the smartest sailors afloat in command of her -- -for we always give you credit for being that -- -she 'll run many a voyage yet . `` `` I 'm paid for the risk , guv'nor , as you said just now , '' the sailor remarked . `` But do n't it seem kind o ' hard on them as is n't -- -on the mates an ' the hands ? `` `` There is always a risk , my dear captain . There is nothing in the world without risk . You remember what is said about those who go down to the sea in ships . They see the wonders of the deep , and in return they incur some little danger . My house in Eccleston Square might be shaken down by an earthquake , or a gale might blow in the walls , but I 'm not always brooding over the chance of it . There 's no use your taking it for granted that some misfortune will happen to theBlack Eagle . `` The sailor was silenced , but not convinced by his employer 's logic . `` Well , well , '' he said sulkily , `` I am going , so there 's an end of it , and there 's no good in having any more palaver about it . You have your object in running rotten ships , and you make it worth my while to take my chances in them . I 'm suited , and you 're suited , so there 's no more to be said . `` `` That 's right . Have some more rum ? `` `` No , not a spot . `` `` Why not ? `` `` Because I likes to keep my head pretty clear when I 'm a-talkin ' to you , Muster Girdlestone . Out o ' your office I 'll drink to further orders , but I wo n't do business and muddle myself at the same time . When d 'ye want me to start ? `` `` When she 's unloaded and loaded up again . Three weeks or a month yet . I expect that Spender will have come in with theMaid of Athensby that time . `` `` Unless some accident happens on the way , '' said Captain Hamilton Miggs , with his old leer . `` He was at Sierra Leone when we came up the coast . I could n't put in there , for the swabs have got a warrant out ag'in me for putting a charge o ' shot into a nigger . `` `` That was a wicked action -- -very wrong , indeed , '' the merchant said gravely . `` You must consider the interests of the firm , Miggs . We ca n't afford to have a good port blocked against our ships in this fashion . Did they serve this writ on you ? `` `` Another nigger brought it aboard . `` `` Did you read it ? `` `` No ; I threw it overboard . `` `` And what became of the negro ? `` `` Well , '' said Miggs with a grin , `` when I threw the writ overboard he happened to be a-holdin ' on to it . So , ye see , he went over , too . Then I up anchor and scooted . `` `` There are sharks about there ? `` `` A few . `` `` Really , Miggs , '' the merchant said , `` you must restrain your sinful passions . You have broken the fifth commandment , and closed the trade of Freetown to theBlack Eagle . `` `` It never was worth a rap , '' the sailor answered . `` I would n't give a cuss for any of the British settlements . Give me real niggers , chaps as knows nothing of law or civilizing , or any rot of the sort . I can pull along with them . `` I have often wondered how you managed it , '' Girdlestone said curiously . `` You succeed in picking up a cargo where the steadiest and best men ca n't get as much as a bag of nuts . How do you work it ? `` `` There 's many would like to know that , '' Miggs answered , with an expressive wink . `` It is a secret , then ? `` `` Well , it ai n't a secret to you , 'cause you ai n't a skipper , and it do n't matter if you knows it or not . I do n't want to have 'em all at the same game . `` `` How is it , then ? `` `` I 'll tell ye , '' said Miggs . He seemed
