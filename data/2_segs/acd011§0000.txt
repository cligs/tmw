`` I am inclined to think -- - '' said I . `` I should do so , '' Sherlock Holmes remarked impatiently.I believe that I am one of the most long-suffering of mortals ; but I 'll admit that I was annoyed at the sardonic interruption . `` Really , Holmes , '' said I severely , `` you are a little trying at times . `` He was too much absorbed with his own thoughts to give any immediate answer to my remonstrance . He leaned upon his hand , with his untasted breakfast before him , and he stared at the slip of paper which he had just drawn from its envelope . Then he took the envelope itself , held it up to the light , and very carefully studied both the exterior and the flap . `` It is Porlock 's writing , '' said he thoughtfully . `` I can hardly doubt that it is Porlock 's writing , though I have seen it only twice before . The Greek e with the peculiar top flourish is distinctive . But if it is Porlock , then it must be something of the very first importance . `` He was speaking to himself rather than to me ; but my vexation disappeared in the interest which the words awakened . `` Who then is Porlock ? '' I asked . `` Porlock , Watson , is a nom-de-plume , a mere identification mark ; but behind it lies a shifty and evasive personality . In a former letter he frankly informed me that the name was not his own , and defied me ever to trace him among the teeming millions of this great city . Porlock is important , not for himself , but for the great man with whom he is in touch . Picture to yourself the pilot fish with the shark , the jackal with the lion -- -anything that is insignificant in companionship with what is formidable : not only formidable , Watson , but sinister -- -in the highest degree sinister . That is where he comes within my purview . You have heard me speak of Professor Moriarty ? `` `` The famous scientific criminal , as famous among crooks as -- - '' '' My blushes , Watson ! '' Holmes murmured in a deprecating voice . `` I was about to say , as he is unknown to the public . `` `` A touch ! A distinct touch ! '' cried Holmes . `` You are developing a certain unexpected vein of pawky humour , Watson , against which I must learn to guard myself . But in calling Moriarty a criminal you are uttering libel in the eyes of the law -- -and there lie the glory and the wonder of it ! The greatest schemer of all time , the organizer of every deviltry , the controlling brain of the underworld , a brain which might have made or marred the destiny of nations -- -that 's the man ! But so aloof is he from general suspicion , so immune from criticism , so admirable in his management and self-effacement , that for those very words that you have uttered he could hale you to a court and emerge with your year 's pension as a solatium for his wounded character . Is he not the celebrated author of The Dynamics of an Asteroid , a book which ascends to such rarefied heights of pure mathematics that it is said that there was no man in the scientific press capable of criticizing it ? Is this a man to traduce ? Foul-mouthed doctor and slandered professor -- -such would be your respective roles ! That 's genius , Watson . But if I am spared by lesser men , our day will surely come . `` `` May I be there to see ! '' I exclaimed devoutly . `` But you were speaking of this man Porlock . `` `` Ah , yes -- -the so-called Porlock is a link in the chain some little way from its great attachment . Porlock is not quite a sound link -- -between ourselves . He is the only flaw in that chain so far as I have been able to test it . `` `` But no chain is stronger than its weakest link . `` `` Exactly , my dear Watson ! Hence the extreme importance of Porlock . Led on by some rudimentary aspirations towards right , and encouraged by the judicious stimulation of an occasional ten-pound note sent to him by devious methods , he has once or twice given me advance information which has been of value -- -that highest value which anticipates and prevents rather than avenges crime . I can not doubt that , if we had the cipher , we should find that this communication is of the nature that I indicate . `` Again Holmes flattened out the paper upon his unused plate . I rose and , leaning over him , stared down at the curious inscription , which ran as follows:534 C2 13 127 36 31 4 17 21 41 DOUGLAS 109 293 5 37 BIRLSTONE 26 BIRLSTONE 9 47 171 '' What do you make of it , Holmes ? `` `` It is obviously an attempt to convey secret information . `` `` But what is the use of a cipher message without the cipher ? `` `` In this instance , none at all . `` `` Why do you say 'in this instance ' ? `` `` Because there are many ciphers which I would read as easily as I do the apocrypha of the agony column : such crude devices amuse the intelligence without fatiguing it . But this is different . It is clearly a reference to the words in a page of some book . Until I am told which page and which book I am powerless . `` `` But why 'Douglas ' and 'Birlstone ' ? `` `` Clearly because those are words which were not contained in the page in question . `` `` Then why has he not indicated the book ? `` `` Your native shrewdness , my dear Watson , that innate cunning which is the delight of your friends , would surely prevent you from inclosing cipher and message in the same envelope . Should it miscarry , you are undone . As it is , both have to go wrong before any harm comes from it . Our second post is now overdue , and I shall be surprised if it does not bring us either a further letter of explanation , or , as is more probable , the very volume to which these figures refer . `` Holmes 's calculation was fulfilled within a very few minutes by the appearance of Billy , the page , with the very letter which we were expecting . `` The same writing , '' remarked Holmes , as he opened the envelope , `` and actually signed , '' he added in an exultant voice as he unfolded the epistle . `` Come , we are getting on , Watson . '' His brow clouded , however , as he glanced over the contents . `` Dear me , this is very disappointing ! I fear , Watson , that all our expectations come to nothing . I trust that the man Porlock will come to no harm . `` DEAR MR. HOLMES [ he says ] : '' I will go no further in this matter . It is too dangerous -- -he suspects me . I can see that he suspects me . He came to me quite unexpectedly after I had actually addressed this envelope with the intention of sending you the key to the cipher . I was able to cover it up . If he had seen it , it would have gone hard with me . But I read suspicion in his eyes . Please burn the cipher message , which can now be of no use to you . `` FRED PORLOCK . `` Holmes sat for some little time twisting this letter between his fingers , and frowning , as he stared into the fire . `` After all , '' he said at last , `` there may be nothing in it . It may be only his guilty conscience . Knowing himself to be a traitor , he may have read the accusation in the other 's eyes . `` `` The other being , I presume , Professor Moriarty . `` `` No less ! When any of that party talk about 'He ' you know whom they mean . There is one predominant 'He ' for all of them . `` `` But what can he do ? '' '' Hum ! That 's a large question . When you have one of the first brains of Europe up against you , and all the powers of darkness at his back , there are infinite possibilities . Anyhow , Friend Porlock is evidently scared out of his senses -- -kindly compare the writing in the note to that upon its envelope ; which was done , he tells us , before this ill-omened visit . The one is clear and firm . The other hardly legible . `` `` Why did he write at all ? Why did he not simply drop it ? `` `` Because he feared I would make some inquiry after him in that case , and possibly bring trouble on him . `` `` No doubt , '' said I . `` Of course . '' I had picked up the original cipher message and was bending my brows over it . `` It 's pretty maddening to think that an important secret may lie here on this slip of paper , and that it is beyond human power to penetrate it . `` Sherlock Holmes had pushed away his untasted breakfast and lit the unsavoury pipe which was the companion of his deepest meditations . `` I wonder ! '' said he , leaning back and staring at the ceiling . `` Perhaps there are points which have escaped your Machiavellian intellect . Let us consider the problem in the light of pure reason . This man 's reference is to a book . That is our point of departure . `` `` A somewhat vague one . `` `` Let us see then if we can narrow it down . As I focus my mind upon it , it seems rather less impenetrable . What indications have we as to this book ? '' '' None . `` `` Well , well , it is surely not quite so bad as that . The cipher message begins with a large 534 , does it not ? We may take it as a working hypothesis that 534 is the particular page to which the cipher refers . So our book has already become a LARGE book , which is surely something gained . What other indications have we as to the nature of this large book ? The next sign is C2 . What do you make of that , Watson ? `` `` Chapter the second , no doubt . `` `` Hardly that , Watson . You will , I am sure , agree with me that if the page be given , the number of the chapter is immaterial . Also that if page 534 finds us only in the second chapter , the length of the first one must have been really intolerable. '' '' Column ! '' I cried . `` Brilliant , Watson . You are scintillating this morning . If it is not column
