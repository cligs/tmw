`` For myself , '' said Sir Nigel , `` I have heard such words fall from the lips of this lady that I am of the opinion that there is no woman , save only one , who can be in any way compared to her in beauty and in goodness . Should any gentleman think otherwise , I should deem it great honor to run a small course with him , or debate the matter in whatever way might be most pleasing to him . `` `` Nay , it would ill become me to cast a slur upon a lady who is both my guest and the wife of my comrade-in-arms , '' said the Seneschal of Villefranche . `` I have perceived also that on her mantle there is marked a silver cross , which is surely sign enough that there is nought of evil in these strange powers which you say that she possesses . `` This argument of the seneschal 's appealed so powerfully to the Bohemian and to the Hospitaller that they at once intimated that their objections had been entirely overcome , while even the Lady Rochefort , who had sat shivering and crossing herself , ceased to cast glances at the door , and allowed her fears to turn to curiosity . `` Among the gifts which have been vouchsafed to my wife , '' said Du Guesclin , `` there is the wondrous one of seeing into the future ; but it comes very seldom upon her , and goes as quickly , for none can command it . The blessed hour of sight , as she hath named it , has come but twice since I have known her , and I can vouch for it that all that she hath told me was true , for on the evening of the Battle of Auray she said that the morrow would be an ill day for me and for Charles of Blois . Ere the sun had sunk again he was dead , and I the prisoner of Sir John Chandos . Yet it is not every question that she can answer , but only those -- -- -- '' '' Bertrand , Bertrand ! '' cried the lady in the same muttering far-away voice , `` the blessed hour passes . Use it , Bertrand , while you may . `` `` I will , my sweet . Tell me , then , what fortune comes upon me ? `` `` Danger , Bertrand -- -deadly , pressing danger -- -which creeps upon you and you know it not . `` The French soldier burst into a thunderous laugh , and his green eyes twinkled with amusement . `` At what time during these twenty years would not that have been a true word ? '' he cried . `` Danger is in the air that I breathe . But is this so very close , Tiphaine ? `` `` Here -- -now -- -close upon you ! '' The words came out in broken , strenuous speech , while the lady 's fair face was writhed and drawn like that of one who looks upon a horror which strikes the words from her lips . Du Guesclin gazed round the tapestried room , at the screens , the tables , the abace , the credence , the buffet with its silver salver , and the half-circle of friendly , wondering faces . There was an utter stillness , save for the sharp breathing of the Lady Tiphaine and for the gentle soughing of the wind outside , which wafted to their ears the distant call upon a swine-herd 's horn . `` The danger may bide , '' said he , shrugging his broad shoulders . `` And now , Tiphaine , tell us what will come of this war in Spain . `` `` I can see little , '' she answered , straining her eyes and puckering her brow , as one who would fain clear her sight . `` There are mountains , and dry plains , and flash of arms and shouting of battle-cries . Yet it is whispered to me that by failure you will succeed. '' '' Ha ! Sir Nigel , how like you that ? '' quoth Bertrand , shaking his head . `` It is like mead and vinegar , half sweet , half sour . And is there no question which you would ask my lady ? `` `` Certes there is . I would fain know , fair lady , how all things are at Twynham Castle , and above all how my sweet lady employs herself . `` `` To answer this I would fain lay hand upon one whose thoughts turn strongly to this castle which you have named . Nay , my Lord Loring , it is whispered to me that there is another here who hath thought more deeply of it than you . `` `` Thought more of mine own home ? '' cried Sir Nigel . `` Lady , I fear that in this matter at least you are mistaken . `` `` Not so , Sir Nigel . Come hither , young man , young English squire with the gray eyes ! Now give me your hand , and place it here across my brow , that I may see that which you have seen . What is this that rises before me ? Mist , mist , rolling mist with a square black tower above it . See it shreds out , it thins , it rises , and there lies a castle in green plain , with the sea beneath it , and a great church within a bow-shot . There are two rivers which run through the meadows , and between them lie the tents of the besiegers . `` `` The besiegers ! '' cried Alleyne , Ford , and Sir Nigel , all three in a breath . `` Yes , truly , and they press hard upon the castle , for they are an exceeding multitude and full of courage . See how they storm and rage against the gate , while some rear ladders , and others , line after line , sweep the walls with their arrows . There are many leaders who shout and beckon , and one , a tall man with a golden beard , who stands before the gate stamping his foot and hallooing them on , as a pricker doth the hounds . But those in the castle fight bravely . There is a woman , two women , who stand upon the walls , and give heart to the men-at-arms . They shower down arrows , darts and great stones . Ah ! they have struck down the tall leader , and the others give back . The mist thickens and I can see no more . `` `` By Saint Paul ! '' said Sir Nigel , `` I do not think that there can be any such doings at Christchurch , and I am very easy of the fortalice so long as my sweet wife hangs the key of the outer bailey at the head of her bed . Yet I will not deny that you have pictured the castle as well as I could have done myself , and I am full of wonderment at all that I have heard and seen . `` `` I would , Lady Tiphaine , '' cried the Lady Rochefort , `` that you would use your power to tell me what hath befallen my golden bracelet which I wore when hawking upon the second Sunday of Advent , and have never set eyes upon since . `` `` Nay , lady , '' said du Guesclin , `` it does not befit so great and wondrous a power to pry and search and play the varlet even to the beautiful chatelaine of Villefranche . Ask a worthy question , and , with the blessing of God , you shall have a worthy answer . `` `` Then I would fain ask , '' cried one of the French squires , `` as to which may hope to conquer in these wars betwixt the English and ourselves . `` `` Both will conquer and each will hold its own , '' answered the Lady Tiphaine . `` Then we shall still hold Gascony and Guienne ? '' cried Sir Nigel.The lady shook her head . `` French land , French blood , French speech , '' she answered . `` They are French , and France shall have them . `` `` But not Bordeaux ? '' cried Sir Nigel excitedly . `` Bordeaux also is for France . `` `` But Calais ? `` `` Calais too . `` `` Woe worth me then , and ill hail to these evil words ! If Bordeaux and Calais be gone , then what is left for England ? `` `` It seems indeed that there are evil times coming upon your country , '' said Du Guesclin . `` In our fondest hopes we never thought to hold Bordeaux . By Saint Ives ! this news hath warmed the heart within me . Our dear country will then be very great in the future , Tiphaine ? `` `` Great , and rich , and beautiful , '' she cried . `` Far down the course of time I can see her still leading the nations , a wayward queen among the peoples , great in war , but greater in peace , quick in thought , deft in action , with her people 's will for her sole monarch , from the sands of Calais to the blue seas of the south. '' '' Ha ! '' cried Du Guesclin , with his eyes flashing in triumph , `` you hear her , Sir Nigel ? -- -and she never yet said word which was not sooth . `` The English knight shook his head moodily . `` What of my own poor country ? '' said he . `` I fear , lady , that what you have said bodes but small good for her . `` The lady sat with parted lips , and her breath came quick and fast . `` My God ! '' she cried , `` what is this that is shown me ? Whence come they , these peoples , these lordly nations , these mighty countries which rise up before me ? I look beyond , and others rise , and yet others , far and farther to the shores of the uttermost waters . They crowd ! They swarm ! The world is given to them , and it resounds with the clang of their hammers and the ringing of their church bells . They call them many names , and they rule them this way or that but they are all English , for I can hear the voices of the people . On I go , and onwards over seas where man hath never yet sailed , and I see a great land under new stars and a stranger sky , and still the land is England . Where have her children not gone ? What have they not done ? Her banner is planted on ice . Her banner is scorched in the sun . She lies athwart the lands , and her shadow is over the seas . Bertrand , Bertrand ! we are undone for the buds of her bud are even as our choicest flower ! '' Her voice rose into a wild cry , and throwing up her arms she sank back white and nerveless into the deep oaken chair . `` It is over , '' said Du
