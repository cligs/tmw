a box of brass-headed nails upon the mantelpiece. '' Mr . Douglas was altering the pictures yesterday , '' he said . `` I saw him myself , standing upon that chair and fixing the big picture above it . That accounts for the hammer . `` `` We 'd best put it back on the rug where we found it , '' said the sergeant , scratching his puzzled head in his perplexity . `` It will want the best brains in the force to get to the bottom of this thing . It will be a London job before it is finished . '' He raised the hand lamp and walked slowly round the room . `` Hullo ! '' he cried , excitedly , drawing the window curtain to one side . `` What o'clock were those curtains drawn ? `` `` When the lamps were lit , '' said the butler . `` It would be shortly after four . `` `` Someone had been hiding here , sure enough . '' He held down the light , and the marks of muddy boots were very visible in the corner . `` I 'm bound to say this bears out your theory , Mr. Barker . It looks as if the man got into the house after four when the curtains were drawn , and before six when the bridge was raised . He slipped into this room , because it was the first that he saw . There was no other place where he could hide , so he popped in behind this curtain . That all seems clear enough . It is likely that his main idea was to burgle the house ; but Mr. Douglas chanced to come upon him , so he murdered him and escaped . `` `` That 's how I read it , '' said Barker . `` But , I say , are n't we wasting precious time ? Could n't we start out and scout the country before the fellow gets away ? `` The sergeant considered for a moment . `` There are no trains before six in the morning ; so he ca n't get away by rail . If he goes by road with his legs all dripping , it 's odds that someone will notice him . Anyhow , I ca n't leave here myself until I am relieved . But I think none of you should go until we see more clearly how we all stand . `` The doctor had taken the lamp and was narrowly scrutinizing the body . `` What 's this mark ? '' he asked . `` Could this have any connection with the crime ? `` The dead man 's right arm was thrust out from his dressing gown , and exposed as high as the elbow . About halfway up the forearm was a curious brown design , a triangle inside a circle , standing out in vivid relief upon the lard-coloured skin . `` It 's not tattooed , '' said the doctor , peering through his glasses . `` I never saw anything like it . The man has been branded at some time as they brand cattle . What is the meaning of this ? `` `` I do n't profess to know the meaning of it , '' said Cecil Barker ; `` but I have seen the mark on Douglas many times this last ten years . `` `` And so have I , '' said the butler . `` Many a time when the master has rolled up his sleeves I have noticed that very mark . I 've often wondered what it could be . `` `` Then it has nothing to do with the crime , anyhow , '' said the sergeant . `` But it 's a rum thing all the same . Everything about this case is rum . Well , what is it now ? `` The butler had given an exclamation of astonishment and was pointing at the dead man 's outstretched hand . `` They 've taken his wedding ring ! '' he gasped. '' What ! `` `` Yes , indeed . Master always wore his plain gold wedding ring on the little finger of his left hand . That ring with the rough nugget on it was above it , and the twisted snake ring on the third finger . There 's the nugget and there 's the snake , but the wedding ring is gone . `` `` He 's right , '' said Barker . `` Do you tell me , '' said the sergeant , `` that the wedding ring was BELOW the other ? '' '' Always ! `` `` Then the murderer , or whoever it was , first took off this ring you call the nugget ring , then the wedding ring , and afterwards put the nugget ring back again . `` `` That is so ! `` The worthy country policeman shook his head . `` Seems to me the sooner we get London on to this case the better , '' said he . `` White Mason is a smart man . No local job has ever been too much for White Mason . It wo n't be long now before he is here to help us . But I expect we 'll have to look to London before we are through . Anyhow , I 'm not ashamed to say that it is a deal too thick for the likes of me . `` At three in the morning the chief Sussex detective , obeying the urgent call from Sergeant Wilson of Birlstone , arrived from headquarters in a light dog-cart behind a breathless trotter . By the five-forty train in the morning he had sent his message to Scotland Yard , and he was at the Birlstone station at twelve o'clock to welcome us . White Mason was a quiet , comfortable-looking person in a loose tweed suit , with a clean-shaved , ruddy face , a stoutish body , and powerful bandy legs adorned with gaiters , looking like a small farmer , a retired gamekeeper , or anything upon earth except a very favourable specimen of the provincial criminal officer . `` A real downright snorter , Mr . MacDonald ! '' he kept repeating . `` We 'll have the pressmen down like flies when they understand it . I 'm hoping we will get our work done before they get poking their noses into it and messing up all the trails . There has been nothing like this that I can remember . There are some bits that will come home to you , Mr. Holmes , or I am mistaken . And you also , Dr. Watson ; for the medicos will have a word to say before we finish . Your room is at the Westville Arms . There 's no other place ; but I hear that it is clean and good . The man will carry your bags . This way , gentlemen , if you please . `` He was a very bustling and genial person , this Sussex detective . In ten minutes we had all found our quarters . In ten more we were seated in the parlour of the inn and being treated to a rapid sketch of those events which have been outlined in the previous chapter . MacDonald made an occasional note ; while Holmes sat absorbed , with the expression of surprised and reverent admiration with which the botanist surveys the rare and precious bloom. '' Remarkable ! '' he said , when the story was unfolded , `` most remarkable ! I can hardly recall any case where the features have been more peculiar . `` `` I thought you would say so , Mr. Holmes , '' said White Mason in great delight . `` We 're well up with the times in Sussex . I 've told you now how matters were , up to the time when I took over from Sergeant Wilson between three and four this morning . My word ! I made the old mare go ! But I need not have been in such a hurry , as it turned out ; for there was nothing immediate that I could do . Sergeant Wilson had all the facts . I checked them and considered them and maybe added a few of my own . `` `` What were they ? '' asked Holmes eagerly . `` Well , I first had the hammer examined . There was Dr. Wood there to help me . We found no signs of violence upon it . I was hoping that if Mr. Douglas defended himself with the hammer , he might have left his mark upon the murderer before he dropped it on the mat . But there was no stain . `` `` That , of course , proves nothing at all , '' remarked Inspector MacDonald . `` There has been many a hammer murder and no trace on the hammer . `` `` Quite so . It does n't prove it was n't used . But there might have been stains , and that would have helped us . As a matter of fact there were none . Then I examined the gun . They were buckshot cartridges , and , as Sergeant Wilson pointed out , the triggers were wired together so that , if you pulled on the hinder one , both barrels were discharged . Whoever fixed that up had made up his mind that he was going to take no chances of missing his man . The sawed gun was not more than two foot long -- -one could carry it easily under one 's coat . There was no complete maker 's name ; but the printed letters P-E-N were on the fluting between the barrels , and the rest of the name had been cut off by the saw . `` `` A big P with a flourish above it , E and N smaller ? '' asked Holmes. '' Exactly . `` `` Pennsylvania Small Arms Company -- -well-known American firm , '' said Holmes.White Mason gazed at my friend as the little village practitioner looks at the Harley Street specialist who by a word can solve the difficulties that perplex him . `` That is very helpful , Mr. Holmes . No doubt you are right . Wonderful ! Wonderful ! Do you carry the names of all the gun makers in the world in your memory ? `` Holmes dismissed the subject with a wave . `` No doubt it is an American shotgun , '' White Mason continued . `` I seem to have read that a sawed-off shotgun is a weapon used in some parts of America . Apart from the name upon the barrel , the idea had occurred to me . There is some evidence then , that this man who entered the house and killed its master was an American . `` MacDonald shook his head . `` Man , you are surely travelling overfast , '' said he . `` I have heard no evidence yet that any stranger was ever in the house at all . `` `` The open window , the blood on the sill , the queer card , the marks of boots in the corner , the gun ! `` `` Nothing there that could not have been arranged . Mr. Douglas was an American , or had lived long in America . So had Mr. Barker . You do n't need to import an American from outside in order to account for American doings . `` `` Ames , the butler -- - '' ''
