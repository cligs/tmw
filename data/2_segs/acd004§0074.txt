their two hundred thick heads together , and then there comes this fellow Aylward and another , as their spokesmen , to say that they will disband unless an Englishman of good name be set over them . There are many of them , as I understand , who come from some great forest which lies in Hampi , or Hampti -- -I can not lay my tongue to the name . Your dwelling is in those parts , and so their thoughts turned to you as their leader . But we had hoped that you would bring a hundred men with you . `` `` They are already at Dax , where we shall join them , '' said Sir Nigel . `` But let the men break their fast , and we shall then take counsel what to do . `` `` Come into my hut , '' said Sir Claude . `` It is but poor fare that I can lay before you -- -milk , cheese , wine , and bacon -- -yet your squire and yourself will doubtless excuse it . This is my house where the pennon flies before the door -- -a small residence to contain the Lord of Montchateau . `` Sir Nigel sat silent and distrait at his meal , while Alleyne hearkened to the clattering tongue of the Gascon , and to his talk of the glories of his own estate , his successes in love , and his triumphs in war . `` And now that you are here , Sir Nigel , '' he said at last , `` I have many fine ventures all ready for us . I have heard that Montpezat is of no great strength , and that there are two hundred thousand crowns in the castle . At Castelnau also there is a cobbler who is in my pay , and who will throw us a rope any dark night from his house by the town wall . I promise you that you shall thrust your arms elbow-deep among good silver pieces ere the nights are moonless again ; for on every hand of us are fair women , rich wine , and good plunder , as much as heart could wish . `` `` I have other plans , '' answered Sir Nigel curtly ; `` for I have come hither to lead these bowmen to the help of the prince , our master , who may have sore need of them ere he set Pedro upon the throne of Spain . It is my purpose to start this very day for Dax upon the Adour , where he hath now pitched his camp . `` The face of the Gascon darkened , and his eyes flashed with resentment . `` For me , '' he said , `` I care little for this war , and I find the life which I lead a very joyous and pleasant one . I will not go to Dax . `` `` Nay , think again , Sir Claude , '' said Sir Nigel gently ; `` for you have ever had the name of a true and loyal knight . Surely you will not hold back now when your master hath need of you . `` `` I will not go to Dax , '' the other shouted . `` But your devoir -- -your oath of fealty ? `` `` I say that I will not go . `` `` Then , Sir Claude , I must lead the Company without you . `` `` If they will follow , '' cried the Gascon with a sneer . `` These are not hired slaves , but free companions , who will do nothing save by their own good wills . In very sooth , my Lord Loring , they are ill men to trifle with , and it were easier to pluck a bone from a hungry bear than to lead a bowman out of a land of plenty and of pleasure . `` `` Then I pray you to gather them together , '' said Sir Nigel , `` and I will tell them what is in my mind ; for if I am their leader they must to Dax , and if I am not then I know not what I am doing in Auvergne . Have my horse ready , Alleyne ; for , by St. Paul ! come what may , I must be upon the homeward road ere mid-day . `` A blast upon the bugle summoned the bowmen to counsel , and they gathered in little knots and groups around a great fallen tree which lay athwart the glade . Sir Nigel sprang lightly upon the trunk , and stood with blinking eye and firm lips looking down at the ring of upturned warlike faces . `` They tell me , bowmen , '' said he , `` that ye have grown so fond of ease and plunder and high living that ye are not to be moved from this pleasant country . But , by Saint Paul ! I will believe no such thing of you , for I can readily see that you are all very valiant men , who would scorn to live here in peace when your prince hath so great a venture before him . Ye have chosen me as a leader , and a leader I will be if ye come with me to Spain ; and I vow to you that my pennon of the five roses shall , if God give me strength and life , be ever where there is most honor to be gained . But if it be your wish to loll and loiter in these glades , bartering glory and renown for vile gold and ill-gotten riches , then ye must find another leader ; for I have lived in honor , and in honor I trust that I shall die . If there be forest men or Hampshire men amongst ye , I call upon them to say whether they will follow the banner of Loring . `` `` Here 's a Romsey man for you ! '' cried a young bowman with a sprig of evergreen set in his helmet . `` And a lad from Alresford ! '' shouted another . `` And from Milton ! `` `` And from Burley ! `` `` And from Lymington ! `` `` And a little one from Brockenhurst ! '' shouted a huge-limbed fellow who sprawled beneath a tree . `` By my hilt ! lads , '' cried Aylward , jumping upon the fallen trunk , `` I think that we could not look the girls in the eyes if we let the prince cross the mountains and did not pull string to clear a path for him . It is very well in time of peace to lead such a life as we have had together , but now the war-banner is in the wind once more , and , by these ten finger-bones ! if he go alone , old Samkin Aylward will walk beside it . `` These words from a man as popular as Aylward decided many of the waverers , and a shout of approval burst from his audience . `` Far be it from me , '' said Sir Claude Latour suavely , `` to persuade you against this worthy archer , or against Sir Nigel Loring ; yet we have been together in many ventures , and perchance it may not be amiss if I say to you what I think upon the matter . `` `` Peace for the little Gascon ! '' cried the archers . `` Let every man have his word . Shoot straight for the mark , lad , and fair play for all . `` `` Bethink you , then , '' said Sir Claude , `` that you go under a hard rule , with neither freedom nor pleasure -- -and for what ? For sixpence a day , at the most ; while now you may walk across the country and stretch out either hand to gather in whatever you have a mind for . What do we not hear of our comrades who have gone with Sir John Hawkwood to Italy ? In one night they have held to ransom six hundred of the richest noblemen of Mantua . They camp before a great city , and the base burghers come forth with the keys , and then they make great spoil ; or , if it please them better , they take so many horse-loads of silver as a composition ; and so they journey on from state to state , rich and free and feared by all . Now , is not that the proper life for a soldier ? `` `` The proper life for a robber ! '' roared Hordle John , in his thundering voice . `` And yet there is much in what the Gascon says , '' said a swarthy fellow in a weather-stained doublet ; `` and I for one would rather prosper in Italy than starve in Spain . `` `` You were always a cur and a traitor , Mark Shaw , '' cried Aylward . `` By my hilt ! if you will stand forth and draw your sword I will warrant you that you will see neither one nor the other . `` `` Nay , Aylward , '' said Sir Nigel , `` we can not mend the matter by broiling . Sir Claude , I think that what you have said does you little honor , and if my words aggrieve you I am ever ready to go deeper into the matter with you . But you shall have such men as will follow you , and you may go where you will , so that you come not with us . Let all who love their prince and country stand fast , while those who think more of a well-lined purse step forth upon the farther side . `` Thirteen bowmen , with hung heads and sheepish faces , stepped forward with Mark Shaw and ranged themselves behind Sir Claude . Amid the hootings and hissings of their comrades , they marched off together to the Gascon 's hut , while the main body broke up their meeting and set cheerily to work packing their possessions , furbishing their weapons , and preparing for the march which lay before them . Over the Tarn and the Garonne , through the vast quagmires of Armagnac , past the swift-flowing Losse , and so down the long valley of the Adour , there was many a long league to be crossed ere they could join themselves to that dark war-cloud which was drifting slowly southwards to the line of the snowy peaks , beyond which the banner of England had never yet been seen.The whole vast plain of Gascony and of Languedoc is an arid and profitless expanse in winter save where the swift-flowing Adour and her snow-fed tributaries , the Louts , the Oloron and the Pau , run down to the sea of Biscay . South of the Adour the jagged line of mountains which fringe the sky-line send out long granite claws , running down into the lowlands and dividing them into `` gaves '' or stretches of valley . Hillocks grow into hills , and hills into mountains , each range overlying its neighbor , until they soar up in the giant chain which raises its spotless and untrodden peaks , white and dazzling , against the pale blue wintry sky.A quiet land is this -- -a land where the slow-moving Basque , with his flat biretta-cap , his red sash and his hempen sandals , tills his scanty
