D 'ye think we 'll let you spoil a lay of this sort as we might never get a chance of again ? `` `` You can do it without me , '' said the Welshman , trembling in every limb . `` And have you turnin ' on us the moment a reward was offered . No , no , chummy , you do n't get out of it that way . If you wo n't stand by us , I 'll take care you do n't split . `` `` Think of the diamonds , '' Farintosh put in . `` Think of your own skin , '' said the navvy . `` You could go back to England a rich man if you do it . `` `` You 'll never go back at all if you do n't . '' Thus worked upon alternately by his hopes and by his fears , Williams showed some signs of yielding . He took a long draught from his glass and filled it up again . `` I ai n't afraid , '' he said . `` Do n't imagine that I am afraid . You wo n't hit him very hard , Mr . Burt ? `` `` Just enough to curl him up , '' the navvy answered . `` Lord love ye , it ai n't the first man by many a one that I 've laid on his back , though I never had the chance before of fingering five and thirty thousand pounds worth of diamonds for my pains . `` `` But the hotel-keeper and the servants ? `` `` That 's all right , '' said Farintosh . `` You leave it to me . If we go up quietly and openly , and come down quietly and openly , who is to suspect anything ? Our horses will be outside , in Woodley Street , and we 'll be out of their reach in no time . Shall we say to-morrow evening for the job ? `` `` That 's very early , '' Williams cried tremulously . `` The sooner the better , '' Burt said , with an oath . `` And look here , young man , '' fixing Williams with his bloodshot eyes , `` one sign of drawing back , and by the living jingo I 'll let you have more than I 'm keeping for him . You hear me , eh ? '' He grasped the youth 's white wrist and squeezed it in his iron grip until he writhed with the pain . `` Oh , I 'm with you , heart and soul , '' he cried . `` I 'm sure what you andMr . Farintosh advise must be for the best . `` `` Meet here at eight o'clock to-morrow night then , '' said the leader . `` We can get it over by nine , and we will have the night for our escape.I 'll have the horses ready , and it will be strange if we do n't get sucha start as will puzzle them . `` So , having arranged all the details of their little plan , these three gentlemen departed in different directions -- -Farintosh to theCentral Hotel , to give Ezra his evening report , and the others to the mining-camps , which were the scene of their labours.The meeting just described took place upon a Tuesday , early in November . On the Saturday Ezra Girdlestone had fully made up his mind to turn his back upon the diggings and begin his homeward journey . He was pining for the pleasures of his old London life , and was weary of the monotonous expanse of the South African veldt . His task was done , too , and it would be well for him to be at a distance before the diggers discovered the manner in which they had been hoaxed . He began to pack his boxes , therefore , and to make every preparation for his departure.He was busily engaged in this employment upon the Wednesday evening when there was a tap at the door and Farintosh walked in , accompanied by Burt and Williams . Girdlestone glanced up at them , and greeted them briefly . He was not surprised at their visit , for they had come together several times before to report progress or make arrangements . Farintosh bowed as he entered the room , Burt nodded , and Williams rubbed his hands together and looked amiably bilious . `` We looked in , Mr. Girdlestone , '' Farintosh began , `` to learn if you had any commands for us . `` `` I told you before that I had not , '' Ezra said curtly . `` I am going onSaturday . I have made a mistake in speculating on those diamonds.Prices are sinking lower and lower . `` `` I am sorry to hear that , '' said Farintosh sympathetically . `` Maybe the market will take a turn . `` `` Let us hope so , '' the merchant answered . `` It does n't look like it . `` `` But you are satisfied with us , guv'nor , '' Burt struck in , pushing his bulky form in front of Farintosh . `` We have done our work all right , have n't we ? `` `` I have nothing to complain of , '' Ezra said coldly . `` Well then , guv'nor , you surely ai n't going away without leaving us nothing to remembrance you with , seeing that we 've stood by you and never gone back on you . `` `` You have been paid every week for what you have done , '' the young man said . `` You wo n't get another penny out of me , so you set your mind at rest about that . `` `` You wo n't give us nothing ? '' cried the navvy angrily . `` No , I wo n't ; and I 'll tell you what it is , Burt , big as you are , if you dare to raise your voice in my presence I 'll give you the soundest hiding that ever you had in your life . `` Ezra had stood up and showed every indication of being as good as his word . `` Do n't let us quarrel the last time we may meet , '' Farintosh cried , intervening between the two . `` It is not money we expect from you . All we want is a drain of rum to drink success to you with . `` `` Oh , if that 's all , '' said the young merchant -- -and turned round to pick up the bottle which stood on a table behind him . Quick as a flash Burt sprang upon him and struck him down with a life-preserver . With a gasping cry and a heavy thud Ezra fell face downwards upon the floor , the bottle still clutched in his senseless hand , and the escaping rum forming a horrible mixture with the blood which streamed from a great gash in his head . `` Very neat -- -very pretty indeed ! '' cried the ex-parson , in a quiet tone of critical satisfaction , as a connoisseur might speak of a specimen which interested him . He was already busy at the door of the safe . `` Well done , Mr. Burt , well done ! '' cried Williams , in a quivering voice ; and going up to the body he kicked it in the side . `` You see I am not afraid , Mr. Burt , am I ? `` `` Stow your gab ! '' snarled the navvy . `` Here 's the rum all gettin ' loose . `` Picking up the bottle he took a pull of what was left in it . `` Here 's the bag , parson , '' he whispered , pulling a black linen bag fromhis pocket . `` We have n't made much noise over the job . `` `` Here are the stones , '' said Farintosh , in the same quiet voice . `` Hold the mouth open . '' He emptied an avalanche of diamonds into the receptacle . `` Here are some notes and gold . We may as well have them too . Now , tie it up carefully . That 's the way ! If we meet any one on the stairs , take it coolly . Turn that lamp out , Williams , so that if any one looks in he 'll see nothing . Come along ! `` The guilty trio stole out of the room , bearing their plunder with them , and walked down the passage of the hotel unmolested and unharmed.The moon , as it rose over the veldt that night , shone on three horsemen spurring it along the Capetown road as though their very lives depended upon their speed . Its calm , clear rays streamed over the silent roofs of Kimberley and in through a particular window of theCentral Hotel , throwing silvery patches upon the carpet , and casting strange shadows from the figure which lay as it had fallen , huddled in an ungainly heap upon the floor.It might perhaps have been as well for the curtailing of this narrative , and for the interests of the world at large if the blow dealt by the sturdy right arm of the navvy had cut short once for all the career of the junior African merchant . Ezra , however , was endowed with a rare vitality , which enabled him not only to shake off the effects of his mishap , but to do so in an extraordinarily short space of time . There was a groan from the prostrate figure , then a feeble movement , then another and a louder groan , and then an oath . Gradually raising himself upon his elbow , he looked around him in a bewildered way , with his other hand pressed to the wound at the back of his head , from which a few narrow little rivulets of blood were still meandering . His glance wandered vaguely over the table and the chairs and the walls , until it rested upon the safe . He could see in the moonlight that it was open , and empty . In a moment the whole circumstances of the case came back to him , and he staggered to the door with a hoarse cry of rage and of despair.Whatever Ezra 's faults may have been , irresolution or want of courage were not among them . In a moment he grasped the situation , and realized that it was absolutely essential that he should act , and at once . The stones must be recovered , or utter and irretrievable ruin stared him in the face . At his cries the landlord and several attendants , white and black , came rushing into the room . `` I 've been robbed and assaulted , '' Ezra said , steadying himself against the mantelpiece , for he was still weak and giddy . `` Do n't all start cackling , but do what I ask you . Light the lamp ! `` The lamp was lit , and there was a murmur from the little knot of employees , reinforced by some late loungers at the bar , as they saw the disordered room and the great crimson patch upon the carpet . `` The thieves called at nine , '' said Ezra , talking rapidly , but collectedly . `` Their names were Farintosh , Burt , and Williams . We talked
