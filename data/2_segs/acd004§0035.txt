perilous and honorable venture may arise from it . I pray you , Edricson , to ride up to them and to ask them the cause of it . `` There was no need , however , for him to move , for the twain came swiftly towards them until they were within a spear 's length , when the man with the cross sat himself down sullenly upon a tussock of grass by the wayside , while the other stood beside him with his great cudgel still hanging over his head . So intent was he that he raised his eyes neither to knight nor squires , but kept them ever fixed with a savage glare upon his comrade . `` I pray you , friend , '' said Sir Nigel , `` to tell us truthfully who you are , and why you follow this man with such bitter enmity ? `` `` So long as I am within the pale of the king 's law , '' the stranger answered , `` I can not see why I should render account to every passing wayfarer . `` `` You are no very shrewd reasoner , fellow , '' quoth the knight ; `` for if it be within the law for you to threaten him with your club , then it is also lawful for me to threaten you with my sword . `` The man with the cross was down in an instant on his knees upon the ground , with hands clasped above him and his face shining with hope . `` For dear Christ 's sake , my fair lord , '' he cried in a crackling voice , `` I have at my belt a bag with a hundred rose nobles , and I will give it to you freely if you will but pass your sword through this man 's body . `` `` How , you foul knave ? '' exclaimed Sir Nigel hotly . `` Do you think that a cavalier 's arm is to be bought like a packman 's ware . By St. Paul ! I have little doubt that this fellow hath some very good cause to hold you in hatred . `` `` Indeed , my fair sir , you speak sooth , '' quoth he with the club , while the other seated himself once more by the wayside . `` For this man is Peter Peterson , a very noted rieve , draw-latch , and murtherer , who has wrought much evil for many years in the parts about Winchester . It was but the other day , upon the feasts of the blessed Simon and Jude , that he slew my younger brother William in Bere Forest -- -for which , by the black thorn of Glastonbury ! I shall have his heart 's blood , though I walk behind him to the further end of earth . `` `` But if this be indeed so , '' asked Sir Nigel , `` why is it that you have come with him so far through the forest ? `` `` Because I am an honest Englishman , and will take no more than the law allows . For when the deed was done this foul and base wretch fled to sanctuary at St. Cross , and I , as you may think , after him with all the posse . The prior , however , hath so ordered that while he holds this cross no man may lay hand upon him without the ban of church , which heaven forfend from me or mine . Yet , if for an instant he lay the cross aside , or if he fail to journey to Pitt 's Deep , where it is ordered that he shall take ship to outland parts , or if he take not the first ship , or if until the ship be ready he walk not every day into the sea as far as his loins , then he becomes outlaw , and I shall forthwith dash out his brains . `` At this the man on the ground snarled up at him like a rat , while the other clenched his teeth , and shook his club , and looked down at him with murder in his eyes . Knight and squire gazed from rogue to avenger , but as it was a matter which none could mend they tarried no longer , but rode upon their way . Alleyne , looking back , saw that the murderer had drawn bread and cheese from his scrip , and was silently munching it , with the protecting cross still hugged to his breast , while the other , black and grim , stood in the sunlit road and threw his dark shadow athwart him.That night the Company slept at St. Leonard 's , in the great monastic barns and spicarium -- -ground well known both to Alleyne and to John , for they were almost within sight of the Abbey of Beaulieu . A strange thrill it gave to the young squire to see the well-remembered white dress once more , and to hear the measured tolling of the deep vespers bell . At early dawn they passed across the broad , sluggish , reed-girt stream -- -men , horses , and baggage in the flat ferry barges -- -and so journeyed on through the fresh morning air past Exbury to Lepe . Topping the heathy down , they came of a sudden full in sight of the old sea-port -- -a cluster of houses , a trail of blue smoke , and a bristle of masts . To right and left the long blue curve of the Solent lapped in a fringe of foam upon the yellow beach . Some way out from the town a line of pessoners , creyers , and other small craft were rolling lazily on the gentle swell . Further out still lay a great merchant-ship , high ended , deep waisted , painted of a canary yellow , and towering above the fishing-boats like a swan among ducklings . `` By St . Paul ! '' said the knight , `` our good merchant of Southampton hath not played us false , for methinks I can see our ship down yonder . He said that she would be of great size and of a yellow shade . `` `` By my hilt , yes ! '' muttered Aylward ; `` she is yellow as a kite 's claw , and would carry as many men as there are pips in a pomegranate . `` `` It is as well , '' remarked Terlake ; `` for methinks , my fair lord , that we are not the only ones who are waiting a passage to Gascony . Mine eye catches at times a flash and sparkle among yonder houses which assuredly never came from shipman 's jacket or the gaberdine of a burgher . `` `` I can also see it , '' said Alleyne , shading his eyes with his hand . `` And I can see men-at-arms in yonder boats which ply betwixt the vessel and the shore . But methinks that we are very welcome here , for already they come forth to meet us . `` A tumultuous crowd of fishermen , citizens , and women had indeed swarmed out from the northern gate , and approached them up the side of the moor , waving their hands and dancing with joy , as though a great fear had been rolled back from their minds . At their head rode a very large and solemn man with a long chin and a drooping lip . He wore a fur tippet round his neck and a heavy gold chain over it , with a medallion which dangled in front of him . `` Welcome , most puissant and noble lord , '' he cried , doffing his bonnet to Black Simon . `` I have heard of your lordship 's valiant deeds , and in sooth they might be expected from your lordship 's face and bearing . Is there any small matter in which I may oblige you ? `` `` Since you ask me , '' said the man-at-arms , `` I would take it kindly if you could spare a link or two of the chain which hangs round your neck . `` `` What , the corporation chain ! '' cried the other in horror . `` The ancient chain of the township of Lepe ! This is but a sorry jest , Sir Nigel . `` `` What the plague did you ask me for then ? '' said Simon . `` But if it is Sir Nigel Loring with whom you would speak , that is he upon the black horse . `` The Mayor of Lepe gazed with amazement on the mild face and slender frame of the famous warrior . `` Your pardon , my gracious lord , '' he cried . `` You see in me the mayor and chief magistrate of the ancient and powerful town of Lepe . I bid you very heartily welcome , and the more so as you are come at a moment when we are sore put to it for means of defence. '' '' Ha ! '' cried Sir Nigel , pricking up his ears . `` Yes , my lord , for the town being very ancient and the walls as old as the town , it follows that they are very ancient too . But there is a certain villainous and bloodthirsty Norman pirate hight Tete-noire , who , with a Genoan called Tito Caracci , commonly known as Spade-beard , hath been a mighty scourge upon these coasts . Indeed , my lord , they are very cruel and black-hearted men , graceless and ruthless , and if they should come to the ancient and powerful town of Lepe then -- - '' '' Then good-bye to the ancient and powerful town of Lepe , '' quoth Ford , whose lightness of tongue could at times rise above his awe of Sir Nigel.The knight , however , was too much intent upon the matter in hand to give heed to the flippancy of his squire . `` Have you then cause , '' he asked , `` to think that these men are about to venture an attempt upon you ? `` `` They have come in two great galleys , '' answered the mayor , `` with two bank of oars on either side , and great store of engines of war and of men-at-arms . At Weymouth and at Portland they have murdered and ravished . Yesterday morning they were at Cowes , and we saw the smoke from the burning crofts . To-day they lie at their ease near Freshwater , and we fear much lest they come upon us and do us a mischief . `` `` We can not tarry , '' said Sir Nigel , riding towards the town , with the mayor upon his left side ; `` the Prince awaits us at Bordeaux , and we may not be behind the general muster . Yet I will promise you that on our way we shall find time to pass Freshwater and to prevail upon these rovers to leave you in peace . `` `` We are much beholden to you ! '' cried the mayor `` But I can not see , my lord , how , without a war-ship , you may venture against these men . With your archers , however , you might well hold the town and do them great scath if they attempt to land . `` `` There is a very proper cog out yonder ,
