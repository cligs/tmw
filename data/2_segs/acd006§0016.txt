a clay at the mess table himself . Draper , who commanded the division , told him it was unsoldier-like . 'Unsoldier-like be demned , ' he said . Ged , they nearly court-martialled the ould man for it . He got the V.C . at the Quarries , and was killed at the Redan . `` A slatternly , slipshod girl answered the bell , and having received her orders and the united available funds of the two comrades , speedily returned with a brace of frothing pint pots . The major ruminated silently over his cigarette for some time , on some unpleasant subject , apparently , for his face was stem and his brows knitted . At last he broke out with an oath . `` Be George ! Baumser , I ca n't stand that young fellow Girdlestone . I 'll have to chuck him up . He 's such a cold-blooded , flinty-hearted , calculating sort of a chap , that -- - '' The remainder of the major 's sentence was lost in the beer flagon . `` What for did you make him your friend , then ? `` `` Well , '' the old soldier confessed , `` it seemed to me that if he wanted to fool his money away at cards or any other divilment , Tobias Clutterbuck might as well have the handling of it as any one else . Bedad , he 's as cunning as a basketful of monkeys . He plays a safe game for low stakes , and never throws away a chance . Demned if I do n't think I 've been a loser in pocket by knowing him , while as to me character , I 'm very sure I 'm the worse there . `` `` Vat 's de matter mit him ? `` `` What 's not the matter with him . If he 's agrayable he 's not natural , and if he 's natural he 's not agrayable . I do n't pretind to be a saint . I 've seen some fun in me day , and hope to see some more before I die ; but there are some things that I would n't do . If I live be cards it 's all fair and aboveboard . I never play anything but games o ' skill , and I reckon on me skill bringing me out on the right side , taking one night with another through the year . Again , at billiards I may not always play me best , but that 's gineralship . You do n't want a whole room to know to a point what your game is . I 'm the last man to preach , but , bedad , I do n't like that chap , and I do n't like that handsome , brazen face of his . I 've spint the greater part of my life reading folks ' faces , and never very far out either . `` Von Baumser made no remark , and the two continued to smoke silently , with an occasional pull at their flagons . `` Besides , it 's no good to me socially , '' the major continued . `` The fellow ca n't keep quiet , else he might pass in a crowd ; but that demned commercial instinct will show itself . If he went to heaven he 'd start an agency for harps and crowns . Did I tell you what the Honourable Jack Gibbs said to me at the club ? Ged , he let me have it straight ! 'Buck , ' he said , 'I do n't mind you . You 're one o ' the right sort when all 's said and done , but if you ever inthroduce such a chap as that to me again , I 'll cut you as well as him for the future . ' I 'd inthroduced them to put the young spalpeen in a good humour , for , being short , as ye know , I thought it might be necessary to negotiate a loan from him . `` `` Vat did you say his name vas ? '' Von Baumser asked suddenly. '' Girdlestone . `` `` Is his father a Kauffmann ? `` `` What the divil is a Kauffmann ? '' the major asked impatiently . `` Is it a merchant you mean ? `` `` Ah , a merchant . One who trades with the Afrikaner ? `` `` The same . `` Von Baumser took a bulky pocket-book from his inside pocket , and scanned a long list of names therein . `` Ah , it is the same , '' he cried at last triumphantly , shutting up the book and replacing it . `` Girdlestone & Co. , African kauf -- -dat is , merchants -- -Fenchurch Street , City . `` `` Those are they . `` `` And you say dey are rich ? '' '' Yes . `` `` Very rich ? '' '' Yes . `` The major began to think that his companion had been imbibing in his absence , for there was an unfathomable smile upon his face , and his red beard and towsy hair seemed to bristle from some internal excitement . `` Very rich ! Ho , ho ! Very rich ! '' he laughed . `` I know dem ; not as friends , Gott bewahre ! but I know dem and their affairs . `` `` What are you driving at ? Let 's have it . Out with it , man . `` `` I tell you , '' said the German , suddenly becoming supernaturally solemn and sawing his hand up and down in the air to emphasize his remarks , `` in tree or four months , or a year at the most , there vill be no firm of Girdlestone . They are rotten , useless -- -whoo ! He blew an imaginary feather up into the air to demonstrate the extreme fragility of the house in question . `` You 're raving , Baumser , '' said Major Clutterbuck excitedly . `` Why , man , their names are above suspicion . They are looked upon as the soundest concern in the City . `` `` Dat may be ; dat may be , '' the German answered stolidly . `` Vat I know , I know , and vat I say I say . `` `` And how d 'ye know it ? D 'ye tell me that you know lore about it than the men on 'Change and the firms that do business with them ? `` `` I know vat I know , and I say vat I say , '' the other repeated . `` Dat tobacco-man Burger is a rogue . Dere is five-and-thirty in the hundred of water in this canaster tobacco , and one must be for ever relighting . `` `` And you wo n't tell me where you heard this of the Girdlestones ? `` `` It vould be no good to you . It Is enough dat vat I say is certain . Let it suffice that dere are people vat are bound to tell other people all dat dey know about anything whatever . `` `` You do n't make it over clear now , '' the old soldier grumbled . `` You mane that these secret societies and Socialists let each other know all that comes in their way and have their own means of getting information . `` `` Dat may be , and dat may not be , '' the German answered , in the same oracular voice . `` I thought , in any case , my good friend Clutterbuck , dat I vould give you vat you call in English the straight tap . It is always vell to have the straight tap . `` `` Thank ye , me boy , '' the major said heartily . `` If the firm 's in a bad way , either the youngster does n't know of it , or else he 's the most natural actor that ever lived . Be George ! there 's the tay-bell ; let 's get down before the bread and butther is all finished. '' Mrs . Robbins was in the habit of furnishing her lodgers with an evening meal at a small sum per head . There was only a certain amount of bread and butter supplied for this , however , and those who came late were likely to find an empty platter . The two Bohemians felt that the subject was too grave a one to trifle with , so they suspended their judgment upon the Girdlestones while they clattered down to the dining-room.Although not a whisper had been heard of it in ordinary commercial circles , there was some foundation for the forecast which Von Baumser had made as to the fate of the great house of Girdlestone . For some time back matters had been going badly with the African traders . If the shrewd eyes of Major Tobias Clutterbuck were unable to detect any indications of this state of affairs in the manner or conversation of the junior partner , the reason simply was that that gentleman was entirely ignorant of the imminent danger which hung over his head . As far as he knew , the concern was as prosperous and as flourishing as it had been at the time of the death of John Harston . The momentous secret was locked in the breast of his grim old father , who bore it about with him as the Spartan lad did the fox -- -without a quiver or groan to indicate the care which was gnawing at his heart . Placed face to face with ruin , Girdlestone fought against it desperately , and , withal , coolly and warily , throwing away no chance and leaving no stone unturned . Above all , he exerted himself -- -and exerted himself successfully -- -to prevent any rumour of the critical position of the firm from leaking out in the city . He knew well that should that once occur nothing could save him . As the wounded buffalo is gored to death by the herd , so the crippled man of business may give up all hope when once his position is known by his fellows . At present , although Von Baumser and a few other such Ishmaelites might have an inkling from sources of their own as to how matters stood , the name of Girdlestone was still regarded by business men as the very synonym for commercial integrity and stability . If anything , there seemed to be more business in Fenchurch Street and more luxury at the residence at Eccleston Square than in former days . Only the stern-faced and silent senior partner knew how thin the veneer was which shone so deceptively upon the surface.Many things had contributed towards this state of affairs . The firm had been involved in a succession of misfortunes , some known to the world , and others known to no one save the elder Girdlestone . The former had been accepted with such perfect stoicism and cheerfulness that they rather increased than diminished the reputation of the concern ; the latter were the more crushing , and also the more difficult to bear.Lines of fine vessels from Liverpool and from Hamburg were running to the West Coast of Africa , and competition had cut down freightage to the lowest possible point . Where the Girdlestones had once held almost a monopoly there were now many in the field . Again , the negroes of the coast were becoming educated and
