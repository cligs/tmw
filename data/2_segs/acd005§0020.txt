Yes , yes , you must be civil . I can not have any unpleasantness . `` `` But you will stay with me , sire ? '' Her supple arms coiled themselves round his neck . Then she held him for an instant at arm 's length to feast her eyes upon his face , and then drew him once more towards her . `` You will not leave me , dear sire . It is so long since you have been here . `` The sweet face , the pink glow in the room , the hush of the evening , all seemed to join in their sensuous influence . Louis sank down upon the settee . `` I will stay , '' said he . `` And that carriage , dear sire , at the east door ? `` `` I have been very harsh with you , Francoise . You will forgive me.Have you paper and pencil , that I may countermand the order ? `` `` They are here , sire , upon the side table . I have also a note which , ifI may leave you for an instant , I will write in the anteroom . `` She swept out with triumph in her eyes . It had been a terrible fight , but all the greater the credit of her victory . She took a little pink slip of paper from an inlaid desk , and dashed off a few words upon it . They were : `` Should Madame de Maintenon have any message for his Majesty , he will be for the next few hours in the room of Madame de Montespan . '' This she addressed to her rival , and it was sent on the spot , together with the king 's order , by the hands of the little black page.For nearly a week the king was constant to his new humour . The routine of his life remained unchanged , save that it was the room of the frail beauty , rather than of Madame de Maintenon , which attracted him in the afternoon . And in sympathy with this sudden relapse into his old life , his coats lost something of their sombre hue , and fawn-colour , buff-colour , and lilac began to replace the blacks and the blues . A little gold lace budded out upon his hats also and at the trimmings of his pockets , while for three days on end hisprie-dieuat the royal chapel had been unoccupied . His walk was brisker , and he gave a youthful flourish to his cane as a defiance to those who had seen in his reformation the first symptoms of age . Madame had known her man well when she threw out that artful insinuation.And as the king brightened , so all the great court brightened too . Thesalonsbegan to resume their former splendour , and gay coats and glittering embroidery which had lain in drawers for years were seen once more in the halls of the palace . In the chapel , Bourdaloue preached in vain to empty benches , but a ballet in the grounds was attended by the whole court , and received with a frenzy of enthusiasm . The Montespan ante-room was crowded every morning with men and women who had some suit to be urged , while her rival 's chambers were as deserted as they had been before the king first turned a gracious look upon her . Faces which had been long banished the court began to reappear in the corridors and gardens unchecked and unrebuked , while the black cassock of the Jesuit and the purple soutane of the bishop were less frequent colours in the royal circle.But the Church party , who , if they were the champions of bigotry , were also those of virtue , were never seriously alarmed at this relapse . The grave eyes of priest or of prelate followed Louis in his escapade as wary huntsmen might watch a young deer which gambols about in the meadow under the impression that it is masterless , when every gap and path is netted , and it is in truth as much in their hands as though it were lying bound before them . They knew how short a time it would be before some ache , some pain , some chance word , would bring his mortality home to him again , and envelop him once more in those superstitious terrors which took the place of religion in his mind . They waited , therefore , and they silently planned how the prodigal might best be dealt with on his return.To this end it was that his confessor , Pere la Chaise , and Bossuet , the great Bishop of Meaux , waited one morning upon Madame de Maintenon in her chamber . With a globe beside her , she was endeavouring to teach geography to the lame Due du Maine and the mischievous little Comte de Toulouse , who had enough of their father 's disposition to make them averse to learning , and of their mother 's to cause them to hate any discipline or restraint . Her wonderful tact , however , and her unwearying patience had won the love and confidence even of these little perverse princes , and it was one of Madame de Montespan 's most bitter griefs that not only her royal lover , but even her own children , turned away from the brilliancy and riches of her salon to pass their time in the modest apartment of her rival.Madame de Maintenon dismissed her two pupils , and received the ecclesiastics with the mixture of affection and respect which was due to those who were not only personal friends , but great lights of the Gallican Church . She had suffered the minister Louvois to sit upon a stool in her presence , but the two chairs were allotted to the priests now , and she insisted upon reserving the humbler seat for herself . The last few days had cast a pallor over her face which spiritualised and refined the features , but she wore unimpaired the expression of sweet serenity which was habitual to her . `` I see , my dear daughter , that you have sorrowed , '' said Bossuet , glancing at her with a kindly and yet searching eye . `` I have indeed , your Grace . All last night I spent in prayer that this trial may pass away from us . `` `` And yet you have no need for fear , madame -- -none , I assure you . Others may think that your influence has ceased ; but we , who know the king 's heart , we think otherwise . A few days may pass , a few weeks at the most , and once more it will be upon your rising fortunes that every eye in France will turn . `` The lady 's brow clouded , and she glanced at the prelate as though his speech were not altogether to her taste . `` I trust that pride does not lead me astray , '' she said . `` But if I can read my own soul aright , there is no thought of myself in the grief which now tears my heart . What is power to me ? What do I desire ? A little room , leisure for my devotions , a pittance to save me from want -- -what more can I ask for ? Why , then , should I covet power ? If I am sore at heart , it is not for any poor loss which I have sustained . I think no more of it than of the snapping of one of the threads on yonder tapestry frame . It is for the king I grieve -- -for the noble heart , the kindly soul , which might rise so high , and which is dragged so low , like a royal eagle with some foul weight which ever hampers its flight . It is for him and for France that my days are spent in sorrow and my nights upon my knees . `` `` For all that , my daughter , you are ambitious . `` It was the Jesuit who had spoken . His voice was clear and cold , and his piercing gray eyes seemed to read into the depths of her soul . `` You may be right , father . God guard me from self-esteem . And yet I do not think that I am . The king , in his goodness , has offered me titles -- - I have refused them ; money -- -I have returned it . He has deigned to ask my advice in matters of state , and I have withheld it . Where , then , is my ambition ? `` `` In your heart , my daughter . But it is not a sinful ambition . It is not an ambition of this world . Would you not love to turn the king towards good ? `` `` I would give my life for it . `` `` And there is your ambition . Ah , can I not read your noble soul ? Would you not love to see the Church reign pure and serene over all this realm -- -to see the poor housed , the needy helped , the wicked turned from their ways , and the king ever the leader in all that is noble and good ? Would you not love that , my daughter ? `` Her cheeks had flushed , and her eyes shone as she looked at the gray face of the Jesuit , and saw the picture which his words had conjured up before her . `` Ah , that would be joy indeed ! '' she cried . `` And greater joy still to know , not from the mouths of the people , but from the voice of your own heart in the privacy of your chamber , that you had been the cause of it , that your influence had brought this blessing upon the king and upon the country . `` `` I would die to do it . `` `` We wish you to do what may be harder . We wish you to live to do it. '' '' Ah ! '' She glanced from one to the other with questioning eyes . `` My daughter , '' said Bossuet solemnly , leaning forward , with his broad white hand outstretched and his purple pastoral ring sparkling in the sunlight , `` it is time for plain speaking . It is in the interests of the Church that we do it . None hear , and none shall ever hear , what passes between us now . Regard us , if you will , as two confessors , with whom your secret is inviolable . I call it a secret , and yet it is none to us , for it is our mission to read the human heart . You love the king . `` `` Your Grace ! '' She started , and a warm blush , mantling up in her pale cheeks , deepened and spread until it tinted her white forehead and her queenly neck . `` You love the king . `` `` Your Grace -- -father ! '' She turned in confusion from one to the other . `` There is no shame in loving , my daughter . The shame lies only in yielding to love . I say again that you love the king . `` `` At least I have never told him so , '' she faltered . `` And
