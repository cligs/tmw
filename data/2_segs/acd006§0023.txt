as would be likely to attend your exertions . `` Now , had there been any third person in the room during this long statement of the young merchant 's , and had that third person been a man of observation , he might have remarked several peculiarities in the major 's demeanour . At the commencement of the address he might have posed as the very model and type of respectable composure . As the plan was gradually unfolded , however , the old soldier began to puff harder at his cigar until a continuous thick grey cloud rose up from him , through which the lurid tip of the havannah shone like a murky meteor . From time to time he passed his hand down his puffy cheeks , as was his custom when excited . Then he moved uneasily in his chair , cleared his throat huskily , and showed other signs of restlessness , all of which were hailed by Ezra Girdlestone as unmistakable proofs of the correctness of his judgment and of the not unnatural eagerness of the veteran on hearing of the windfall which chance had placed in his way.When the young man had finished , the major stood up with his face to the empty fire-place , his legs apart , his chest inflated , and his body rocking ponderously backwards and forwards . `` Let me be quite sure that I understand you , '' he said . `` You wish me to go to Russia ? `` `` Quite so , '' Ezra remarked , rubbing his hands pleasantly . `` You have the goodness to suggist that on me way I should rook me fellow-passengers in the boat ? `` `` That is to say , if you think it worth your while . `` `` Quite so , if I think it worth me while . I am then to procade across the counthry to some mountains -- - '' '' The Urals . `` `` And there I am to pretind to discover certain diamond mines , and am to give weight to me story by the fact that I am known to be a man of good birth , and also by exhibiting some rough stones which you wish me to take out with me from England ? `` `` Quite right , major , '' Ezra said encouragingly . `` I am then to tilegraph or write this lie to England and git it inserted in the papers ? `` `` That 's an ugly word , '' Ezra remonstrated . `` This 'report ' we will say.A report may be either true or false , you know . `` `` And by this report , thin , '' the major continued , `` you reckon that the market will be so affected that your father and you will be able to buy and sell in a manner that will be profitable to you , but by which you will do other people out of their money ? `` `` You have an unpleasant way of putting it , '' said Ezra , with a forced laugh ; `` but you have the idea right . `` `` I have another idea as well , '' roared the old soldier , flushing purple with passion . `` I 've an idea that if I was twinty years younger I 'd see whether you 'd fit through that window , Master Girdlestone . Ged ! I 'd have taught you to propose such a schame to a man with blue blood in his veins , you scounthrel ! `` Ezra fell back in his chair . He was outwardly composed , but there was a dangerous glitter in his eye , and his face had turned from a healthy olive to a dull yellow tint . `` You wo n't do it ? '' he gasped . `` Do it ! D 'ye think that a man who 's worn Her Majesty 's scarlet jacket for twinty years would dirty his hands with such a trick ? I tell ye , I would n't do it for all the money that iver was coined . Look here , Girdlestone , I know you , but , by the Lord , you do n't know me ! `` The young merchant sat silently in his chair , with the same livid colour upon his face and savage expression in his eyes . Major Tobias Clutterbuck stood at the end of the table , stooping forward so as to lean his hands upon it , with his eyes protuberant and his scanty grey fringe in a bristle with indignation . `` What right had you to come to me with such a proposal ? I do n't set up for being a saint , Lord knows , but , be George ! I 've some morals , such as they are , and I mean to stick to them . One of me rules of life has been niver to know a blackgaird , and so , me young friend , from this day forth you and I go on our own roads . Ged ! I 'm not particular , but 'you must draw the line somewhere , ' as me frind , Charlie Monteith , of the Indian Horse , used to say I when he cut his father-in-law . I draw it at you . `` While the major was solemnly delivering himself of these sentiments , Ezra continued to sit watching him in a particularly venomous manner . His straight , cruel lips were blanched with passion , and the veins stood out upon his forehead . The young man was a famous amateur bruiser , and could fight a round with any professional in London . The old soldier would be a child in his hands . As the latter picked up his hat preparatory to leaving the room , Ezra rose and bolted the door upon the inside . `` It 's worth five pounds in a police court , '' he muttered to himself , and knotting up his great hands , which glittered with rings , he approached his companion with his head sunk upon his breast , his eyes flashing from under his dark brows , and the slow , stealthy step of a beast of prey . There was a characteristic refinement of cruelty about his attack , as though he wished to gloat over the helplessness of his victim , and give him time to realize his position before he set upon him.If such were his intention he failed signally in producing the desired effect . The instant the major perceived his manoeuvre he pulled himself up to his full height , as he might have done on parade , and slipping his hand beneath the tails of his frock-coat , produced a small glittering implement , which he levelled straight at the young merchant 's head . `` A revolver ! '' Ezra gasped , staggering back . `` No , a derringer , '' said the veteran blandly . `` I got into the thrick of carrying one when I was in Colorado , and I have stuck to it ever since . You niver know when it may be useful . '' As he spoke he continued to hold the black muzzle of his pistol in a dead line with the centre of the young man 's forehead , and to follow the latter 's movements with a hand which was as steady as a rock . Ezra was no coward , but he ceased his advance and stood irresolute . `` Now , thin , '' cried the major , in sharp military accents , `` undo that door . `` The young merchant took one look at the threatening apoplectic face of his antagonist , and another at the ugly black spot which covered him . He stooped , and pushed back the bolt . `` Now , open it ! Ged , if you do n't look alive I 'll have to blow a hole in you afther all . You would n't be the first man I 've killed , nor the last maybe . `` Ezra opened the door precipitately . `` Now walk before me into the strate . `` It struck the waiters at Nelson 's well-known restaurant as a somewhat curious thing that their two customers should walk out with such very grave faces and in so unsociable a manner . `` C'est la froideur Anglaise ! '' remarked little Alphonse Lefanue to a fellow exile as they paused in the laying of tables to observe the phenomenon . Neither of them noticed that the stout gentleman behind with his hand placed jauntily in the breast of his coat , was still clutching the brown handle of a pistol.There was a hansom standing at the door and Major Clutterbuck stepped into it . `` Look ye here , Girdlestone , '' he said , as the latter stood looking sulkily up and down the street . `` You should learn a lesson from this . Never attack a man unless you 're sure that he 's unarmed . You may git shot , if you do . `` Ezra continued to stare gloomily into vacancy and took no notice of his late companion 's remark . `` Another thing , '' said the major . `` You must niver take it for granted that every man you mate is as great a blackgaird as yourself . `` The young merchant gave him a malignant glance from his dark eyes and was turning to go , but the gentleman in the cab stretched out his hand to detain him . `` One more lesson , '' he said . `` Never funk a pistol unless you are sure there 's a carthridge inside . Mine had n't . Drive on , cabby ! '' With which parting shot the gallant major rattled away down Piccadilly with a fixed determination never again to leave his rooms without a few of Eley 's No 4 central fires in his pocket.There were rejoicings in Phillimore Gardens over Tom 's engagement , for the two old people were both heartily fond of Kate -- - '' our Kate , '' as they were wont proudly to call her . The physician chafed at first over the idea of keeping the matter a secret from Girdlestone . A little reflection served to show him , however , that there was nothing to be gained by informing him , while Kate 's life , during the time that she was forced to remain under his roof , would be more tolerable as long as he was kept in ignorance of it . In the meanwhile the lovers saw little of each other , and Tom was only consoled by the thought that every day which passed brought him nearer to the time when he could claim his prize without concealment or fear . He went about as happy and as light-hearted a man as any in all London . His mother was delighted at his high spirits , but his bluff old father was not so well satisfied . `` Confound the lad ! '' he said to himself . `` He is settling down to a life of idleness . It suits him too well . We must get him to choose one way or the other . `` Accordingly , after breakfast one morning , the doctor asked his son to step with him into the library , where he lit his long cherry-wood pipe , as was his custom after every meal , and smoked for some time in silence . `` You must do something to keep you from mischief
