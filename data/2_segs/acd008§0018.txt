of his working ? He could see none . He threw down his brush , and , lighting his pipe , he strolled downstairs once more.His father was standing in front of the fire , and in no very good humour , as his red face and puckered eyes sufficed to show . `` Well , Robert , '' he began , `` I suppose that , as usual , you have spent your morning plotting against your father ? `` `` What do you mean , father ? `` `` I mean what I say . What is it but plotting when three folk -- -you and she and this Raffles Haw -- -whisper and arrange and have meetings without a word to me about it ? What do I know of your plans ? `` `` I can not tell you secrets which are not my own , father . `` `` But I 'll have a voice in the matter , for all that . Secrets or no secrets , you will find that Laura has a father , and that he is not a man to be set aside . I may have had my ups and downs in trade , but I have not quite fallen so low that I am nothing in my own family . What am I to get out of this precious marriage ? `` `` What should you get ? Surely Laura 's happiness and welfare are enough for you ? `` `` If this man were really fond of Laura he would show proper consideration for Laura 's father . It was only yesterday that I asked him for a loan-condescended actually to ask for it -- -I , who have been within an ace of being Mayor of Birmingham ! And he refused me point blank . `` `` Oh , father ! How could you expose yourself to such humiliation ? `` `` Refused me point blank ! '' cried the old man excitedly . `` It was against his principles , if you please . But I 'll be even with him -- -you see if I am not . I know one or two things about him . What is it they call him at the Three Pigeons ? A 'smasher ' -- -that 's the word-a coiner of false money . Why else should he have this metal sent him , and that great smoky chimney of his going all day ? `` `` Why can you not leave him alone , father ? '' expostulated Robert . `` You seem to think of nothing but his money . If he had not a penny he would still be a very kind-hearted , pleasant gentleman . `` Old McIntyre burst into a hoarse laugh . `` I like to hear you preach , '' said he . `` Without a penny , indeed ! Do you think that you would dance attendance upon him if he were a poor man ? Do you think that Laura would ever have looked twice at him ? You know as well as I do that she is marrying him only for his money . `` Robert gave a cry of dismay . There was the alchemist standing in the doorway , pale and silent , looking from one to the other of them with his searching eyes . `` I must apologise , '' he said coldly . `` I did not mean to listen to your words . I could not help it . But I have heard them . As to you , Mr. McIntyre , I believe that you speak from your own bad heart . I will not let myself be moved by your words . In Robert I have a true friend . Laura also loves me for my own sake . You can not shake my faith in them . But with you , Mr. McIntyre , I have nothing in common ; and it is as well , perhaps , that we should both recognise the fact . `` He bowed , and was gone ere either of the McIntyres could say a word . `` You see ! '' said Robert at last . `` You have done now what you can not undo ! `` `` I will be even with him ! '' cried the old man furiously , shaking his fist through the window at the dark slow-pacing figure . `` You just wait , Robert , and see if your old dad is a man to be played with . `` Not a word was said to Laura when she returned as to the scene which had occurred in her absence . She was in the gayest of spirits , and prattled merrily about her purchases and her arrangements , wondering from time to time when Raffles Haw would come . As night fell , however , without any word from him , she became uneasy . `` What can be the matter that he does not come ? '' she said . `` It is the first day since our engagement that I have not seen him . `` Robert looked out through the window . `` It is a gusty night , and raining hard , '' he remarked . `` I do not at all expect him . `` `` Poor Hector used to come , rain , snow , or fine . But , then , of course , he was a sailor . It was nothing to him . I hope that Raffles is not ill. '' '' He was quite well when I saw him this morning , '' answered her brother , and they relapsed into silence , while the rain pattered against the windows , and the wind screamed amid the branches of the elms outside.Old McIntyre had sat in the corner most of the day biting his nails and glowering into the fire , with a brooding , malignant expression upon his wrinkled features . Contrary to his usual habits , he did not go to the village inn , but shuffled off early to bed without a word to his children . Laura and Robert remained chatting for some time by the fire , she talking of the thousand and one wonderful things which were to be done when she was mistress of the New Hall . There was less philanthropy in her talk when her future husband was absent , and Robert could not but remark that her carriages , her dresses , her receptions , and her travels in distant countries were the topics into which she threw all the enthusiasm which he had formerly heard her bestow upon refuge homes and labour organisations . `` I think that greys are the nicest horses , '' she said . `` Bays are nice too , but greys are more showy . We could manage with a brougham and a landau , and perhaps a high dog-cart for Raffles . He has the coach-house full at present , but he never uses them , and I am sure that those fifty horses would all die for want of exercise , or get livers like Strasburg geese , if they waited for him to ride or drive them . `` `` I suppose that you will still live here ? '' said her brother . `` We must have a house in London as well , and run up for the season . I do n't , of course , like to make suggestions now , but it will be different afterwards . I am sure that Raffles will do it if I ask him . It is all very well for him to say that he does not want any thanks or honours , but I should like to know what is the use of being a public benefactor if you are to have no return for it . I am sure that if he does only half what he talks of doing , they will make him a peer -- -Lord Tamfield , perhaps -- -and then , of course , I shall be my Lady Tamfield , and what would you think of that , Bob ? '' She dropped him a stately curtsey , and tossed her head in the air , as one who was born to wear a coronet . `` Father must be pensioned off , '' she remarked presently . `` He shall have so much a year on condition that he keeps away . As to you , Bob , I do n't know what we shall do for you . We shall make you President of the Royal Academy if money can do it . `` It was late before they ceased building their air-castles and retired to their rooms . But Robert 's brain was excited , and he could not sleep . The events of the day had been enough to shake a stronger man . There had been the revelation of the morning , the strange sights which he had witnessed in the laboratory , and the immense secret which had been confided to his keeping . Then there had been his conversation with his father in the afternoon , their disagreement , and the sudden intrusion of Raffles Haw . Finally the talk with his sister had excited his imagination , and driven sleep from his eyelids . In vain he turned and twisted in his bed , or paced the floor of his chamber . He was not only awake , but abnormally awake , with every nerve highly strung , and every sense at the keenest . What was he to do to gain a little sleep ? It flashed across him that there was brandy in the decanter downstairs , and that a glass might act as a sedative.He had opened the door of his room , when suddenly his ear caught the sound of slow and stealthy footsteps upon the stairs . His own lamp was unlit , but a dim glimmer came from a moving taper , and a long black shadow travelled down the wall . He stood motionless , listening intently . The steps were in the hall now , and he heard a gentle creaking as the key was cautiously turned in the door . The next instant there came a gust of cold air , the taper was extinguished , and a sharp snap announced that the door had been closed from without.Robert stood astonished . Who could this night wanderer be ? It must be his father . But what errand could take him out at three in the morning ? And such a morning , too ! With every blast of the wind the rain beat up against his chamber-window as though it would drive it in . The glass rattled in the frames , and the tree outside creaked and groaned as its great branches were tossed about by the gale . What could draw any man forth upon such a night ? Hurriedly Robert struck a match and lit his lamp . His father 's room was opposite his own , and the door was ajar . He pushed it open and looked about him . It was empty . The bed had not even been lain upon . The single chair stood by the window , and there the old man must have sat since he left them . There was no book , no paper , no means by which he could have amused himself , nothing but a razor-strop lying on the window-sill.A feeling of impending misfortune struck cold to Robert 's heart . There was some ill-meaning in this journey of his father 's . He thought of his brooding of yesterday , his
