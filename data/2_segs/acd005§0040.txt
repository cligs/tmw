him put out his hand to her hair , even as you sprang from the window . Another instant and he would have had her scalped . But she is a fair woman , the fairest that ever my eyes rested upon , and it is not fit that she should kneel here upon these boards . '' He dragged her husband 's long black cloak from him , and made a pillow for the senseless woman with a tenderness and delicacy which came strangely from a man of his build and bearing.He was still stooping over her when there came the clang of the falling bridge , and an instant later the clatter of the hoofs of a troop of cavalry , who swept with wave of plumes , toss of manes , and jingle of steel into the courtyard . At the head was a tall horseman in the full dress of the guards , with a curling feather in his hat , high buff gloves , and his sword gleaming in the sunlight . He cantered forward towards the scaffold , his keen dark eyes taking in every detail of the group which awaited him there . De Catinat 's face brightened at the sight of him , and he was down in an instant beside his stirrup . `` De Brissac ! `` `` De Catinat ! Now where in the name of wonder did you come from ? `` `` I have been a prisoner . Tell me , De Brissac , did you leave the message in Paris ? `` `` Certainly I did . `` `` And the archbishop came ? `` `` He did . `` `` And the marriage ? `` `` Took place as arranged . That is why this poor woman whom I see yonder has had to leave the palace . `` `` I thought as much . `` `` I trust that no harm has come to her ? `` `` My friend and I were just in time to save her . Her husband lies there.He is a fiend , De Brissac . `` `` Very likely ; but an angel might have grown bitter had he had the same treatment . `` `` We have him pinioned here . He has slain a man , and I have slain another . `` `` On my word , you have been busy . `` `` How did you know that we were here ? `` `` Nay , that is an unexpected pleasure . `` `` You did not come for us , then ? `` `` No ; we came for the lady . `` `` And how did this fellow get hold of her ? `` `` Her brother was to have taken her in his carriage . Her husband learned it , and by a lying message he coaxed her into his own , which was at another door . When De Vivonne found that she did not come , and that her rooms were empty , he made inquiries , and soon learned how she had gone . De Montespan 's arms had been seen on the panel , and so the king sent me here with my troop as fast as we could gallop . `` `` Ah , and you would have come too late had a strange chance not brought us here . I know not who it was who waylaid us , for this man seemed to know nothing of the matter . However , all that will be clearer afterwards . What is to be done now ? `` `` I have my own orders . Madame is to be sent to Petit Bourg , and any who are concerned in offering her violence are to be kept until the king 's pleasure is known . The castle , too , must be held for the king . But you , De Catinat , you have nothing to do now ? `` `` Nothing , save that I would like well to ride into Paris to see that all is right with my uncle and his daughter . `` `` Ah , that sweet little cousin of thine ! By my soul , I do not wonder that the folk know you well in the Rue St. Martin . Well , I have carried a message for you once , and you shall do as much for me now . `` `` With all my heart . And whither ? `` `` To Versailles . The king will be on fire to know how we have fared . You have the best right to tell him , since without you and your friend yonder it would have been but a sorry tale . `` `` I will be there in two hours . `` `` Have you horses ? `` `` Ours were slain . `` `` You will find some in the stables here . Pick the best , since you have lost your own in the king 's service . `` The advice was too good to be overlooked . De Catinat , beckoning to Amos Green , hurried away with him to the stables , while De Brissac , with a few short sharp orders , disarmed the retainers , stationed his guardsmen all over the castle , and arranged for the removal of the lady , and for the custody of her husband . An hour later the two friends were riding swiftly down the country road , inhaling the sweet air , which seemed the fresher for their late experience of the dank , foul vapours of their dungeon . Far behind them a little dark pinnacle jutting over a grove of trees marked the chateau which they had left , while on the extreme horizon to the west there came a quick shimmer and sparkle where the level rays of the early sun gleamed upon the magnificent palace which was their goal.Two days after Madame de Maintenon 's marriage to the king there was held within the humble walls of her little room a meeting which was destined to cause untold misery to many hundreds of thousands of people , and yet , in the wisdom of Providence , to be an instrument in carrying French arts and French ingenuity and French sprightliness among those heavier Teutonic peoples who have been the stronger and the better ever since for the leaven which they then received . For in history great evils have sometimes arisen from a virtue , and most beneficent results have often followed hard upon a crime.The time had come when the Church was to claim her promise from madame , and her pale cheek and sad eyes showed how vain it had been for her to try and drown the pleadings of her tender heart by the arguments of the bigots around her . She knew the Huguenots of France . Who could know them better , seeing that she was herself from their stock , and had been brought up in their faith ? She knew their patience , their nobility , their independence , their tenacity . What chance was there that they would conform to the king 's wish ? A few great nobles might , but the others would laugh at the galleys , the jail , or even the gallows when the faith of their fathers was at stake . If their creed were no longer tolerated , then , and if they remained true to it , they must either fly from the country or spend a living death tugging at an oar or working in a chain-gang upon the roads . It was a dreadful alternative to present to a people who were so numerous that they made a small nation in themselves . And most dreadful of all , that she who was of their own blood should cast her voice against them . And yet her promise had been given , and now the time had come when it must be redeemed.The eloquent Bishop Bossuet was there , with Louvois , the minister of war , and the famous Jesuit , Father la Chaise , each piling argument upon argument to overcome the reluctance of the king . Beside them stood another priest , so thin and so pale that he might have risen from his bed of death , but with a fierce light burning in his large dark eyes , and with a terrible resolution in his drawn brows and in the set of his grim , lanky jaw . Madame bent over her tapestry and weaved her coloured silks in silence , while the king leaned upon his hand and listened with the face of a man who knows that he is driven , and yet can hardly turn against the goads . On the low table lay a paper , with pen and ink beside it . It was the order for the revocation , and it only needed the king 's signature to make it the law of the land . `` And so , father , you are of opinion that if I stamp out heresy in this fashion I shall assure my own salvation in the next world ? '' he asked . `` You will have merited a reward . `` `` And you think so too , Monsieur Bishop ? `` `` Assuredly , sire . `` `` And you . Abbe du Chayla ? `` The emaciated priest spoke for the first time , a tinge of colour creeping into his corpse-like cheeks , and a more lurid light in his deep-set eyes . `` I know not about assuring your salvation , sire . I think it would take very much more to do that . But there can not be a doubt as to your damnation if you do not do it . `` The king started angrily , and frowned at the speaker . `` Your words are somewhat more curt than I am accustomed to , '' he remarked . `` In such a matter it were cruel indeed to leave you in doubt . I say again that your soul 's fate hangs upon the balance . Heresy is a mortal sin . Thousands of heretics would turn to the Church if you did but give the word . Therefore these thousands of mortal sins are all upon your soul . What hope for it then , if you do not amend ? `` `` My father and my grandfather tolerated them . `` `` Then , without some special extension of the grace of God , your father and your grandfather are burning in hell. '' '' Insolent ! '' The king sprang from his seat . `` Sire , I will say what I hold to be the truth were you fifty times a king . What care I for any man when I know that I speak for the King of kings ? See ; are these the limbs of one who would shrink from testifying to truth ? '' With a sudden movement he threw back the long sleeves of his gown and shot out his white fleshless arms . The bones were all knotted and bent and screwed into the most fantastic shapes . Even Louvois , the hardened man of the court , and his two brother priests , shuddered at the sight of those dreadful limbs . He raised them above his head and turned his burning eyes upwards . `` Heaven has chosen me to testify for the faith before now , '' said he . `` I heard that blood was wanted to nourish the young Church of Siam , and so to Siam I journeyed . They tore me open ; they crucified me
