you , boy , that that waggon is loaded with gold. '' '' Gold ! `` `` With solid bars of gold , Robert . But come into the plantation and we shall see what becomes of it . `` They passed through the lodge gates , behind the waggon , and then wandered off among the fir-trees until they gained a spot where they could command a view . The load had halted , not in front of the house , but at the door of the out-building with the chimney . A staff of stablemen and footmen were in readiness , who proceeded to swiftly unload and to carry the packages through the door . It was the first time that Robert had ever seen any one save the master of the house enter the laboratory . No sign was seen of him now , however , and in half an hour the contents had all been safely stored and the waggon had driven briskly away . `` I can not understand it , father , '' said Robert thoughtfully , as they resumed their walk . `` Supposing that your supposition is correct , who would send him such quantities of gold , and where could it come from ? `` `` Ha , you have to come to the old man after all ! '' chuckled his companion . `` I can see the little game . It is clear enough to me . There are two of them in it , you understand . The other one gets the gold . Never mind how , but we will hope that there is no harm . Let us suppose , for example , that they have found a marvellous mine , where you can just shovel it out like clay from a pit . Well , then , he sends it on to this one , and he has his furnaces and his chemicals , and he refines and purifies it and makes it fit to sell . That 's my explanation of it , Robert . Eh , has the old man put his finger on it ? `` `` But if that were true , father , the gold must go back again . `` `` So it does , Robert , but a little at a time . Ha , ha ! I 've had my eyes open , you see . Every night it goes down in a small cart , and is sent on to London by the 7.40 . Not in bars this time , but done up in iron-bound chests . I 've seen them , boy , and I 've had this hand upon them . `` `` Well , '' said the young man thoughtfully , `` maybe you are right . It is possible that you are right . `` While father and son were prying into his secrets , Raffles Haw had found his way to Elmdene , where Laura sat reading theQueenby the fire . `` I am so sorry , '' she said , throwing down her paper and springing to her feet . `` They are all out except me . But I am sure that they wo n't be long . I expect Robert every moment . `` `` I would rather speak with you alone , '' answered Raffles Haw quietly . `` Pray sit down , for I wanted to have a little chat with you . `` Laura resumed her seat with a flush upon her cheeks and a quickening of the breath . She turned her face away and gazed into the fire ; but there was a sparkle in her eyes which was not caught from the leaping flames . `` Do you remember the first time that we met , Miss McIntyre ? '' he asked , standing on the rug and looking down at her dark hair , and the beautifully feminine curve of her ivory neck . `` As if it were yesterday , '' she answered in her sweet mellow tones . `` Then you must also remember the wild words that I said when we parted . It was very foolish of me . I am sure that I am most sorry if I frightened or disturbed you , but I have been a very solitary man for a long time , and I have dropped into a bad habit of thinking aloud . Your voice , your face , your manner , were all so like my ideal of a true woman , loving , faithful , and sympathetic , that I could not help wondering whether , if I were a poor man , I might ever hope to win the affection of such a one . `` `` Your good opinion , Mr. Raffles Haw , is very dear to me , '' said Laura . `` I assure you that I was not frightened , and that there is no need to apologise for what was really a compliment . `` `` Since then I have found , '' he continued , `` that all that I had read upon your face was true . That your mind is indeed that of the true woman , full of the noblest and sweetest qualities which human nature can aspire to . You know that I am a man of fortune , but I wish you to dismiss that consideration from your mind . Do you think from what you know of my character that you could be happy as my wife , Laura ? `` She made no answer , but still sat with her head turned away and her sparkling eyes fixed upon the fire . One little foot from under her skirt tapped nervously upon the rug . `` It is only right that you should know a little more about me before you decide . There is , however , little to know . I am an orphan , and , as far as I know , without a relation upon earth . My father was a respectable man , a country surgeon in Wales , and he brought me up to his own profession . Before I had passed my examinations , however , he died and left me a small annuity . I had conceived a great liking for the subjects of chemistry and electricity , and instead of going on with my medical work I devoted myself entirely to these studies , and eventually built myself a laboratory where I could follow out my own researches . At about this time I came into a very large sum of money , so large as to make me feel that a vast responsibility rested upon me in the use which I made of it . After some thought I determined to build a large house in a quiet part of the country , not too far from a great centre . There I could be in touch with the world , and yet would have quiet and leisure to mature the schemes which were in my head . As it chanced , I chose Tamfield as my site . All that remains now is to carry out the plans which I have made , and to endeavour to lighten the earth of some of the misery and injustice which weigh it down . I again ask you , Laura , will you throw in your lot with mine , and help me in the life 's work which lies before me ? `` Laura looked up at him , at his stringy figure , his pale face , his keen , yet gentle eyes . Somehow as she looked there seemed to form itself beside him some shadow of Hector Spurling , the manly features , the clear , firm mouth , the frank manner . Now , in the very moment of her triumph , it sprang clearly up in her mind how at the hour of their ruin he had stood firmly by them , and had loved the penniless girl as tenderly as the heiress to fortune . That last embrace at the door , too , came back to her , and she felt his lips warm upon her own . `` I am very much honoured , Mr. Haw , '' she stammered , `` but this is so sudden . I have not had time to think . I do not know what to say . `` `` Do not let me hurry you , '' he cried earnestly . `` I beg that you will think well over it . I shall come again for my answer . When shall I come ? Tonight ? `` `` Yes , come tonight . `` `` Then , adieu . Believe me that I think more highly of you for your hesitation . I shall live in hope . '' He raised her hand to his lips , and left her to her own thoughts.But what those thoughts were did not long remain in doubt . Dimmer and dimmer grew the vision of the distant sailor face , clearer and clearer the image of the vast palace , of the queenly power , of the diamonds , the gold , the ambitious future . It all lay at her feet , waiting to be picked up . How could she have hesitated , even for a moment ? She rose , and , walking over to her desk , she took out a sheet of paper and an envelope . The latter she addressed to Lieutenant Spurling , H.M.S.Active , Gibraltar . The note cost some little trouble , but at last she got it worded to her mind . `` Dear Hector , '' she said -- - '' I am convinced that your father has never entirely approved of our engagement , otherwise he would not have thrown obstacles in the way of our marriage . I am sure , too , that since my poor father 's misfortune it is only your own sense of honour and feeling of duty which have kept you true to me , and that you would have done infinitely better had you never seen me . I can not bear , Hector , to allow you to imperil your future for my sake , and I have determined , after thinking well over the matter , to release you from our boy and girl engagement , so that you may be entirely free in every way . It is possible that you may think it unkind of me to do this now , but I am quite sure , dear Hector , that when you are an admiral and a very distinguished man , you will look back at this , and you will see that I have been a true friend to you , and have prevented you from making a false step early in your career . For myself , whether I marry or not , I have determined to devote the remainder of my life to trying to do good , and to leaving the world happier than I found it . Your father is very well , and gave us a capital sermon last Sunday . I enclose the bank-note which you asked me to keep for you . Good-bye , for ever , dear Hector , and believe me when I say that , come what may , I am ever your true friend , `` Laura S . McIntyre . `` She had hardly sealed her letter before her father and Robert returned . She closed the door behind them , and made them a little curtsey . `` I await my family 's congratulations , '' she said , with her head
