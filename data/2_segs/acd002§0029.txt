`` `` What is the next move ? `` `` To see Sir Henry . Ah , here he is ! `` `` Good-morning , Holmes , '' said the baronet . `` You look like a general who is planning a battle with his chief of the staff . `` `` That is the exact situation . Watson was asking for orders . `` `` And so do I . `` `` Very good . You are engaged , as I understand , to dine with our friends the Stapletons tonight . `` `` I hope that you will come also . They are very hospitable people , and I am sure that they would be very glad to see you . `` `` I fear that Watson and I must go to London . `` `` To London ? `` `` Yes , I think that we should be more useful there at the present juncture . `` The baronet 's face perceptibly lengthened . `` I hoped that you were going to see me through this business . The Hall and the moor are not very pleasant places when one is alone . `` `` My dear fellow , you must trust me implicitly and do exactly what I tell you . You can tell your friends that we should have been happy to have come with you , but that urgent business required us to be in town . We hope very soon to return to Devonshire . Will you remember to give them that message ? `` `` If you insist upon it . `` `` There is no alternative , I assure you . `` I saw by the baronet 's clouded brow that he was deeply hurt by what he regarded as our desertion . `` When do you desire to go ? '' he asked coldly . `` Immediately after breakfast . We will drive in to Coombe Tracey , but Watson will leave his things as a pledge that he will come back to you . Watson , you will send a note to Stapleton to tell him that you regret that you can not come . `` `` I have a good mind to go to London with you , '' said the baronet . `` Why should I stay here alone ? `` `` Because it is your post of duty . Because you gave me your word that you would do as you were told , and I tell you to stay . `` `` All right , then , I 'll stay . `` `` One more direction ! I wish you to drive to Merripit House . Send back your trap , however , and let them know that you intend to walk home . `` `` To walk across the moor ? '' '' Yes . `` `` But that is the very thing which you have so often cautioned me not to do . `` `` This time you may do it with safety . If I had not every confidence in your nerve and courage I would not suggest it , but it is essential that you should do it . `` `` Then I will do it . `` `` And as you value your life do not go across the moor in any direction save along the straight path which leads from Merripit House to the Grimpen Road , and is your natural way home . `` `` I will do just what you say . `` `` Very good . I should be glad to get away as soon after breakfast as possible , so as to reach London in the afternoon . `` I was much astounded by this programme , though I remembered that Holmes had said to Stapleton on the night before that his visit would terminate next day . It had not crossed my mind however , that he would wish me to go with him , nor could I understand how we could both be absent at a moment which he himself declared to be critical . There was nothing for it , however , but implicit obedience ; so we bade good-bye to our rueful friend , and a couple of hours afterwards we were at the station of Coombe Tracey and had dispatched the trap upon its return journey . A small boy was waiting upon the platform . `` Any orders , sir ? `` `` You will take this train to town , Cartwright . The moment you arrive you will send a wire to Sir Henry Baskerville , in my name , to say that if he finds the pocketbook which I have dropped he is to send it by registered post to Baker Street . `` `` Yes , sir . `` `` And ask at the station office if there is a message for me . `` The boy returned with a telegram , which Holmes handed to me . It ran : Wire received . Coming down with unsigned warrant . Arrive five-forty . Lestrade . `` That is in answer to mine of this morning . He is the best of the professionals , I think , and we may need his assistance . Now , Watson , I think that we can not employ our time better than by calling upon your acquaintance , Mrs. Laura Lyons . `` His plan of campaign was beginning to be evident . He would use the baronet in order to convince the Stapletons that we were really gone , while we should actually return at the instant when we were likely to be needed . That telegram from London , if mentioned by Sir Henry to the Stapletons , must remove the last suspicions from their minds . Already I seemed to see our nets drawing closer around that leanjawed pike.Mrs . Laura Lyons was in her office , and Sherlock Holmes opened his interview with a frankness and directness which considerably amazed her . `` I am investigating the circumstances which attended the death of the late Sir Charles Baskerville , '' said he . `` My friend here , Dr. Watson , has informed me of what you have communicated , and also of what you have withheld in connection with that matter . `` `` What have I withheld ? '' she asked defiantly . `` You have confessed that you asked Sir Charles to be at the gate at ten o'clock . We know that that was the place and hour of his death . You have withheld what the connection is between these events . `` `` There is no connection . `` `` In that case the coincidence must indeed be an extraordinary one . But I think that we shall succeed in establishing a connection , after all . I wish to be perfectly frank with you , Mrs. Lyons . We regard this case as one of murder , and the evidence may implicate not only your friend Mr. Stapleton but his wife as well . `` The lady sprang from her chair . `` His wife ! '' she cried . `` The fact is no longer a secret . The person who has passed for his sister is really his wife. '' Mrs . Lyons had resumed her seat . Her hands were grasping the arms of her chair , and I saw that the pink nails had turned white with the pressure of her grip . `` His wife ! '' she said again . `` His wife ! He is not a married man . `` Sherlock Holmes shrugged his shoulders . `` Prove it to me ! Prove it to me ! And if you can do so -- - ! `` The fierce flash of her eyes said more than any words . `` I have come prepared to do so , '' said Holmes , drawing several papers from his pocket . `` Here is a photograph of the couple taken in York four years ago . It is indorsed 'Mr . and Mrs. Vandeleur , ' but you will have no difficulty in recognizing him , and her also , if you know her by sight . Here are three written descriptions by trustworthy witnesses of Mr. and Mrs. Vandeleur , who at that time kept St. Oliver 's private school . Read them and see if you can doubt the identity of these people . `` She glanced at them , and then looked up at us with the set , rigid face of a desperate woman. '' Mr . Holmes , '' she said , `` this man had offered me marriage on condition that I could get a divorce from my husband . He has lied to me , the villain , in every conceivable way . Not one word of truth has he ever told me . And why -- -why ? I imagined that all was for my own sake . But now I see that I was never anything but a tool in his hands . Why should I preserve faith with him who never kept any with me ? Why should I try to shield him from the consequences of his own wicked acts ? Ask me what you like , and there is nothing which I shall hold back . One thing I swear to you , and that is that when I wrote the letter I never dreamed of any harm to the old gentleman , who had been my kindest friend . `` `` I entirely believe you , madam , '' said Sherlock Holmes . `` The recital of these events must be very painful to you , and perhaps it will make it easier if I tell you what occurred , and you can check me if I make any material mistake . The sending of this letter was suggested to you by Stapleton ? `` `` He dictated it . `` `` I presume that the reason he gave was that you would receive help from Sir Charles for the legal expenses connected with your divorce ? '' '' Exactly . `` `` And then after you had sent the letter he dissuaded you from keeping the appointment ? `` `` He told me that it would hurt his self-respect that any other man should find the money for such an object , and that though he was a poor man himself he would devote his last penny to removing the obstacles which divided us . `` `` He appears to be a very consistent character . And then you heard nothing until you read the reports of the death in the paper ? '' '' No . `` `` And he made you swear to say nothing about your appointment with Sir Charles ? `` `` He did . He said that the death was a very mysterious one , and that I should certainly be suspected if the facts came out . He frightened me into remaining silent . `` `` Quite so . But you had your suspicions ? `` She hesitated and looked down . `` I knew him , '' she said . `` But if he had kept faith with me I should always have done so with him . `` `` I think that on the whole you have had a fortunate escape , '' said Sherlock Holmes . `` You have had him in your power and he knew it , and yet you are alive . You have been walking for some months very near to the edge of a precipice . We must wish you good-morning now , Mrs. Lyons , and it is probable that you will very shortly hear from us again . `` `` Our case
