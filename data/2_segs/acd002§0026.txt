smiling face and a murderous heart . `` It is he , then , who is our enemy -- -it is he who dogged us in London ? `` `` So I read the riddle . `` `` And the warning -- -it must have come from her ! '' '' Exactly . `` The shape of some monstrous villainy , half seen , half guessed , loomed through the darkness which had girt me so long . `` But are you sure of this , Holmes ? How do you know that the woman is his wife ? `` `` Because he so far forgot himself as to tell you a true piece of autobiography upon the occasion when he first met you , and I dare say he has many a time regretted it since . He was once a schoolmaster in the north of England . Now , there is no one more easy to trace than a schoolmaster . There are scholastic agencies by which one may identify any man who has been in the profession . A little investigation showed me that a school had come to grief under atrocious circumstances , and that the man who had owned it -- -the name was different -- -had disappeared with his wife . The descriptions agreed . When I learned that the missing man was devoted to entomology the identification was complete . `` The darkness was rising , but much was still hidden by the shadows . `` If this woman is in truth his wife , where does Mrs. Laura Lyons come in ? '' I asked . `` That is one of the points upon which your own researches have shed a light . Your interview with the lady has cleared the situation very much . I did not know about a projected divorce between herself and her husband . In that case , regarding Stapleton as an unmarried man , she counted no doubt upon becoming his wife . `` `` And when she is undeceived ? `` `` Why , then we may find the lady of service . It must be our first duty to see her -- -both of us -- -tomorrow . Do n't you think , Watson , that you are away from your charge rather long ? Your place should be at Baskerville Hall . `` The last red streaks had faded away in the west and night had settled upon the moor . A few faint stars were gleaming in a violet sky . `` One last question , Holmes , '' I said as I rose . `` Surely there is no need of secrecy between you and me . What is the meaning of it all ? What is he after ? `` Holmes 's voice sank as he answered : '' It is murder , Watson -- -refined , cold-blooded , deliberate murder . Do not ask me for particulars . My nets are closing upon him , even as his are upon Sir Henry , and with your help he is already almost at my mercy . There is but one danger which can threaten us . It is that he should strike before we are ready to do so . Another day -- -two at the most -- -and I have my case complete , but until then guard your charge as closely as ever a fond mother watched her ailing child . Your mission today has justified itself , and yet I could almost wish that you had not left his side . Hark ! `` A terrible scream -- -a prolonged yell of horror and anguish -- -burst out of the silence of the moor . That frightful cry turned the blood to ice in my veins . `` Oh , my God ! '' I gasped . `` What is it ? What does it mean ? `` Holmes had sprung to his feet , and I saw his dark , athletic outline at the door of the hut , his shoulders stooping , his head thrust forward , his face peering into the darkness. '' Hush ! '' he whispered . `` Hush ! `` The cry had been loud on account of its vehemence , but it had pealed out from somewhere far off on the shadowy plain . Now it burst upon our ears , nearer , louder , more urgent than before . `` Where is it ? '' Holmes whispered ; and I knew from the thrill of his voice that he , the man of iron , was shaken to the soul . `` Where is it , Watson ? `` `` There , I think . '' I pointed into the darkness . `` No , there ! `` Again the agonized cry swept through the silent night , louder and much nearer than ever . And a new sound mingled with it , a deep , muttered rumble , musical and yet menacing , rising and falling like the low , constant murmur of the sea . `` The hound ! '' cried Holmes . `` Come , Watson , come ! Great heavens , if we are too late ! `` He had started running swiftly over the moor , and I had followed at his heels . But now from somewhere among the broken ground immediately in front of us there came one last despairing yell , and then a dull , heavy thud . We halted and listened . Not another sound broke the heavy silence of the windless night.I saw Holmes put his hand to his forehead like a man distracted . He stamped his feet upon the ground . `` He has beaten us , Watson . We are too late . `` `` No , no , surely not ! `` `` Fool that I was to hold my hand . And you , Watson , see what comes of abandoning your charge ! But , by Heaven , if the worst has happened we 'll avenge him ! `` Blindly we ran through the gloom , blundering against boulders , forcing our way through gorse bushes , panting up hills and rushing down slopes , heading always in the direction whence those dreadful sounds had come . At every rise Holmes looked eagerly round him , but the shadows were thick upon the moor , and nothing moved upon its dreary face . `` Can you see anything ? '' '' Nothing . `` `` But , hark , what is that ? `` A low moan had fallen upon our ears . There it was again upon our left ! On that side a ridge of rocks ended in a sheer cliff which overlooked a stone-strewn slope . On its jagged face was spread-eagled some dark , irregular object . As we ran towards it the vague outline hardened into a definite shape . It was a prostrate man face downward upon the ground , the head doubled under him at a horrible angle , the shoulders rounded and the body hunched together as if in the act of throwing a somersault . So grotesque was the attitude that I could not for the instant realize that that moan had been the passing of his soul . Not a whisper , not a rustle , rose now from the dark figure over which we stooped . Holmes laid his hand upon him and held it up again with an exclamation of horror . The gleam of the match which he struck shone upon his clotted fingers and upon the ghastly pool which widened slowly from the crushed skull of the victim . And it shone upon something else which turned our hearts sick and faint within us -- -the body of Sir Henry Baskerville ! There was no chance of either of us forgetting that peculiar ruddy tweed suit -- -the very one which he had worn on the first morning that we had seen him in Baker Street . We caught the one clear glimpse of it , and then the match flickered and went out , even as the hope had gone out of our souls . Holmes groaned , and his face glimmered white through the darkness . `` The brute ! The brute ! '' I cried with clenched hands . `` Oh Holmes , I shall never forgive myself for having left him to his fate . `` `` I am more to blame than you , Watson . In order to have my case well rounded and complete , I have thrown away the life of my client . It is the greatest blow which has befallen me in my career . But how could I know -- -how could I know -- -that he would risk his life alone upon the moor in the face of all my warnings ? `` `` That we should have heard his screams -- -my God , those screams ! -- -and yet have been unable to save him ! Where is this brute of a hound which drove him to his death ? It may be lurking among these rocks at this instant . And Stapleton , where is he ? He shall answer for this deed . `` `` He shall . I will see to that . Uncle and nephew have been murdered -- -the one frightened to death by the very sight of a beast which he thought to be supernatural , the other driven to his end in his wild flight to escape from it . But now we have to prove the connection between the man and the beast . Save from what we heard , we can not even swear to the existence of the latter , since Sir Henry has evidently died from the fall . But , by heavens , cunning as he is , the fellow shall be in my power before another day is past ! `` We stood with bitter hearts on either side of the mangled body , overwhelmed by this sudden and irrevocable disaster which had brought all our long and weary labours to so piteous an end . Then as the moon rose we climbed to the top of the rocks over which our poor friend had fallen , and from the summit we gazed out over the shadowy moor , half silver and half gloom . Far away , miles off , in the direction of Grimpen , a single steady yellow light was shining . It could only come from the lonely abode of the Stapletons . With a bitter curse I shook my fist at it as I gazed . `` Why should we not seize him at once ? `` `` Our case is not complete . The fellow is wary and cunning to the last degree . It is not what we know , but what we can prove . If we make one false move the villain may escape us yet . `` `` What can we do ? `` `` There will be plenty for us to do tomorrow . Tonight we can only perform the last offices to our poor friend . `` Together we made our way down the precipitous slope and approached the body , black and clear against the silvered stones . The agony of those contorted limbs struck me with a spasm of pain and blurred my eyes with tears . `` We must send for help , Holmes ! We can not carry him all the way to the Hall . Good heavens , are you mad ? `` He had uttered a cry and bent over the body . Now he was dancing and laughing and wringing my hand . Could this be my stern , self-contained friend ?
