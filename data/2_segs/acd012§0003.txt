'im at 'is word -- -but there , I would n't have the 'eart . 'E and the missus would be like two babes left out in a bundle . I 'm just everything . And then 'e goes and gives me notice . `` `` Why would no one stay ? '' I asked . `` Well , they would n't make allowances , same as I do . 'E 's a very clever man , the master -- -so clever that 'e 's clean balmy sometimes . I 've seen 'im right off 'is onion , and no error . Well , look what 'e did this morning . `` `` What did he do ? `` Austin bent over to me . `` 'E bit the 'ousekeeper , '' said he in a hoarse whisper . `` Bit her ? `` `` Yes , sir . Bit 'er on the leg . I saw 'er with my own eyes startin ' a marathon from the 'all-door . `` `` Good gracious ! `` `` So you 'd say , sir , if you could see some of the goings on . 'E do n't make friends with the neighbors . There 's some of them thinks that when 'e was up among those monsters you wrote about , it was just ''Ome , Sweet 'Ome ' for the master , and 'e was never in fitter company . That 's whattheysay . But I 've served 'im ten years , and I 'm fond of 'im , and , mind you , 'e 's a great man , when all 's said an ' done , and it 's an honor to serve 'im . But 'e does try one cruel at times . Now look at that , sir . That ai n't what you might call old-fashioned 'ospitality , is it now ? Just you read it for yourself . `` The car on its lowest speed had ground its way up a steep , curving ascent . At the corner a notice-board peered over a well-clipped hedge . As Austin said , it was not difficult to read , for the words were few and arresting : -- - \+ -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -\+ | WARNING . | | -- -- | | Visitors , Pressmen , and Mendicants | | are not encouraged . | | | | G. E. CHALLENGER . | \+ -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -\+ '' No , it 's not what you might call 'earty , '' said Austin , shaking his head and glancing up at the deplorable placard . `` It would n't look well in a Christmas card . I beg your pardon , sir , for I have n't spoke as much as this for many a long year , but to-day my feelings seem to 'ave got the better of me . 'E can sack me till 'e 's blue in the face , but I ai n't going , and that 's flat . I 'm 'is man and 'e 's my master , and so it will be , I expect , to the end of the chapter . `` We had passed between the white posts of a gate and up a curving drive , lined with rhododendron bushes . Beyond stood a low brick house , picked out with white woodwork , very comfortable and pretty . Mrs . Challenger , a small , dainty , smiling figure , stood in the open doorway to welcome us . `` Well , my dear , '' said Challenger , bustling out of the car , `` here are our visitors . It is something new for us to have visitors , is it not ? No love lost between us and our neighbors , is there ? If they could get rat poison into our baker 's cart , I expect it would be there . `` `` It 's dreadful -- -dreadful ! '' cried the lady , between laughter and tears . `` George is always quarreling with everyone . We have n't a friend on the countryside . `` `` It enables me to concentrate my attention upon my incomparable wife , '' said Challenger , passing his short , thick arm round her waist . Picture a gorilla and a gazelle , and you have the pair of them . `` Come , come , these gentlemen are tired from the journey , and luncheon should be ready . Has Sarah returned ? `` The lady shook her head ruefully , and the Professor laughed loudly and stroked his beard in his masterful fashion . `` Austin , '' he cried , `` when you have put up the car you will kindly help your mistress to lay the lunch . Now , gentlemen , will you please step into my study , for there are one or two very urgent things which I am anxious to say to you . `` As we crossed the hall the telephone-bell rang , and we were the involuntary auditors of Professor Challenger 's end of the ensuing dialogue . I say `` we , '' but no one within a hundred yards could have failed to hear the booming of that monstrous voice , which reverberated through the house . His answers lingered in my mind . `` Yes , yes , of course , it is I ... . Yes , certainly , theProfessor Challenger , the famous Professor , who else ? ... Of course , every word of it , otherwise I should not have written it ... . I should n't be surprised ... . There is every indication of it ... . Within a day or so at the furthest ... . Well , I ca n't help that , can I ? ... Very unpleasant , no doubt , but I rather fancy it will affect more important people than you . There is no use whining about it ... . No , I could n't possibly . You must take your chance ... . That 's enough , sir . Nonsense ! I have something more important to do than to listen to such twaddle . `` He shut off with a crash and led us upstairs into a large airy apartment which formed his study . On the great mahogany desk seven or eight unopened telegrams were lying . `` Really , '' he said as he gathered them up , `` I begin to think that it would save my correspondents ' money if I were to adopt a telegraphic address . Possibly 'Noah , Rotherfield , ' would be the most appropriate . `` As usual when he made an obscure joke , he leaned against the desk and bellowed in a paroxysm of laughter , his hands shaking so that he could hardly open the envelopes. '' Noah ! Noah ! '' he gasped , with a face of beetroot , while Lord John and I smiled in sympathy and Summerlee , like a dyspeptic goat , wagged his head in sardonic disagreement . Finally Challenger , still rumbling and exploding , began to open his telegrams . The three of us stood in the bow window and occupied ourselves in admiring the magnificent view.It was certainly worth looking at . The road in its gentle curves had really brought us to a considerable elevation -- -seven hundred feet , as we afterwards discovered . Challenger 's house was on the very edge of the hill , and from its southern face , in which was the study window , one looked across the vast stretch of the weald to where the gentle curves of the South Downs formed an undulating horizon . In a cleft of the hills a haze of smoke marked the position of Lewes . Immediately at our feet there lay a rolling plain of heather , with the long , vivid green stretches of the Crowborough golf course , all dotted with the players . A little to the south , through an opening in the woods , we could see a section of the main line from London to Brighton . In the immediate foreground , under our very noses , was a small enclosed yard , in which stood the car which had brought us from the station.An ejaculation from Challenger caused us to turn . He had read his telegrams and had arranged them in a little methodical pile upon his desk . His broad , rugged face , or as much of it as was visible over the matted beard , was still deeply flushed , and he seemed to be under the influence of some strong excitement . `` Well , gentlemen , '' he said , in a voice as if he was addressing a public meeting , `` this is indeed an interesting reunion , and it takes place under extraordinary -- -I may say unprecedented -- -circumstances . May I ask if you have observed anything upon your journey from town ? `` `` The only thing which I observed , '' said Summerlee with a sour smile , `` was that our young friend here has not improved in his manners during the years that have passed . I am sorry to state that I have had to seriously complain of his conduct in the train , and I should be wanting in frankness if I did not say that it has left a most unpleasant impression in my mind . `` `` Well , well , we all get a bit prosy sometimes , '' said Lord John . `` The young fellah meant no real harm . After all , he 's an International , so if he takes half an hour to describe a game of football he has more right to do it than most folk . `` `` Half an hour to describe a game ! '' I cried indignantly . `` Why , it was you that took half an hour with some long-winded story about a buffalo . Professor Summerlee will be my witness . `` `` I can hardly judge which of you was the most utterly wearisome , '' said Summerlee . `` I declare to you , Challenger , that I never wish to hear of football or of buffaloes so long as I live . `` `` I have never said one word to-day about football , '' I protested.Lord John gave a shrill whistle , and Summerlee shook his head sadly . `` So early in the day too , '' said he . `` It is indeed deplorable . As I sat there in sad but thoughtful silence -- -- -- '' '' In silence ! '' cried Lord John . `` Why , you were doin ' a music-hall turn of imitations all the way -- -more like a runaway gramophone than a man . `` Summerlee drew himself up in bitter protest . `` You are pleased to be facetious , Lord John , '' said he with a face of vinegar . `` Why , dash it all , this is clear madness , '' cried Lord John . `` Each of us seems to know what the others did and none of us knows what he did himself . Let 's put it all together from the first . We got into a first-class smoker , that 's clear , ai n't it ? Then we began to quarrel over friend Challenger 's letter in the Times . `` `` Oh , you did ,
