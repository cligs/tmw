part exposed , when McMurdo dashed up the stair and pushed him back . `` You 'll kill the man , '' said he . `` Drop it ! `` Baldwin looked at him in amazement . `` Curse you ! '' he cried . `` Who are you to interfere -- -you that are new to the lodge ? Stand back ! '' He raised his stick ; but McMurdo had whipped his pistol out of his pocket . `` Stand back yourself ! '' he cried . `` I 'll blow your face in if you lay a hand on me . As to the lodge , was n't it the order of the Bodymaster that the man was not to be killed -- -and what are you doing but killing him ? `` `` It 's truth he says , '' remarked one of the men . `` By Gar ! you 'd best hurry yourselves ! '' cried the man below . `` The windows are all lighting up , and you 'll have the whole town here inside of five minutes . `` There was indeed the sound of shouting in the street , and a little group of compositors and pressmen was forming in the hall below and nerving itself to action . Leaving the limp and motionless body of the editor at the head of the stair , the criminals rushed down and made their way swiftly along the street . Having reached the Union House , some of them mixed with the crowd in McGinty 's saloon , whispering across the bar to the Boss that the job had been well carried through . Others , and among them McMurdo , broke away into side streets , and so by devious paths to their own homes.When McMurdo awoke next morning he had good reason to remember his initiation into the lodge . His head ached with the effect of the drink , and his arm , where he had been branded , was hot and swollen . Having his own peculiar source of income , he was irregular in his attendance at his work ; so he had a late breakfast , and remained at home for the morning writing a long letter to a friend . Afterwards he read the Daily Herald . In a special column put in at the last moment he read : OUTRAGE AT THE HERALD OFFICE -- -EDITOR SERIOUSLY INJURED.It was a short account of the facts with which he was himself more familiar than the writer could have been . It ended with the statement : The matter is now in the hands of the police ; but it can hardly be hoped that their exertions will be attended by any better results than in the past . Some of the men were recognized , and there is hope that a conviction may be obtained . The source of the outrage was , it need hardly be said , that infamous society which has held this community in bondage for so long a period , and against which the Herald has taken so uncompromising a stand . Mr. Stanger 's many friends will rejoice to hear that , though he has been cruelly and brutally beaten , and though he has sustained severe injuries about the head , there is no immediate danger to his life.Below it stated that a guard of police , armed with Winchester rifles , had been requisitioned for the defense of the office.McMurdo had laid down the paper , and was lighting his pipe with a hand which was shaky from the excesses of the previous evening , when there was a knock outside , and his landlady brought to him a note which had just been handed in by a lad . It was unsigned , and ran thus : I should wish to speak to you , but would rather not do so in your house . You will find me beside the flagstaff upon Miller Hill . If you will come there now , I have something which it is important for you to hear and for me to say.McMurdo read the note twice with the utmost surprise ; for he could not imagine what it meant or who was the author of it . Had it been in a feminine hand , he might have imagined that it was the beginning of one of those adventures which had been familiar enough in his past life . But it was the writing of a man , and of a well educated one , too . Finally , after some hesitation , he determined to see the matter through.Miller Hill is an ill-kept public park in the very centre of the town . In summer it is a favourite resort of the people , but in winter it is desolate enough . From the top of it one has a view not only of the whole straggling , grimy town , but of the winding valley beneath , with its scattered mines and factories blackening the snow on each side of it , and of the wooded and white-capped ranges flanking it.McMurdo strolled up the winding path hedged in with evergreens until he reached the deserted restaurant which forms the centre of summer gaiety . Beside it was a bare flagstaff , and underneath it a man , his hat drawn down and the collar of his overcoat turned up . When he turned his face McMurdo saw that it was Brother Morris , he who had incurred the anger of the Bodymaster the night before . The lodge sign was given and exchanged as they met . `` I wanted to have a word with you , Mr. McMurdo , '' said the older man , speaking with a hesitation which showed that he was on delicate ground . `` It was kind of you to come . `` `` Why did you not put your name to the note ? `` `` One has to be cautious , mister . One never knows in times like these how a thing may come back to one . One never knows either who to trust or who not to trust . `` `` Surely one may trust brothers of the lodge . `` `` No , no , not always , '' cried Morris with vehemence . `` Whatever we say , even what we think , seems to go back to that man McGinty . `` `` Look here ! '' said McMurdo sternly . `` It was only last night , as you know well , that I swore good faith to our Bodymaster . Would you be asking me to break my oath ? `` `` If that is the view you take , '' said Morris sadly , `` I can only say that I am sorry I gave you the trouble to come and meet me . Things have come to a bad pass when two free citizens can not speak their thoughts to each other . `` McMurdo , who had been watching his companion very narrowly , relaxed somewhat in his bearing . `` Sure I spoke for myself only , '' said he . `` I am a newcomer , as you know , and I am strange to it all . It is not for me to open my mouth , Mr. Morris , and if you think well to say anything to me I am here to hear it . `` `` And to take it back to Boss McGinty ! '' said Morris bitterly . `` Indeed , then , you do me injustice there , '' cried McMurdo . `` For myself I am loyal to the lodge , and so I tell you straight ; but I would be a poor creature if I were to repeat to any other what you might say to me in confidence . It will go no further than me ; though I warn you that you may get neither help nor sympathy . `` `` I have given up looking for either the one or the other , '' said Morris . `` I may be putting my very life in your hands by what I say ; but , bad as you are -- -and it seemed to me last night that you were shaping to be as bad as the worst -- -still you are new to it , and your conscience can not yet be as hardened as theirs . That was why I thought to speak with you . `` `` Well , what have you to say ? `` `` If you give me away , may a curse be on you ! `` `` Sure , I said I would not . `` `` I would ask you , then , when you joined the Freeman 's society in Chicago and swore vows of charity and fidelity , did ever it cross your mind that you might find it would lead you to crime ? `` `` If you call it crime , '' McMurdo answered . `` Call it crime ! '' cried Morris , his voice vibrating with passion . `` You have seen little of it if you can call it anything else . Was it crime last night when a man old enough to be your father was beaten till the blood dripped from his white hairs ? Was that crime -- -or what else would you call it ? `` `` There are some would say it was war , '' said McMurdo , `` a war of two classes with all in , so that each struck as best it could . `` `` Well , did you think of such a thing when you joined the Freeman 's society at Chicago ? `` `` No , I 'm bound to say I did not . `` `` Nor did I when I joined it at Philadelphia . It was just a benefit club and a meeting place for one 's fellows . Then I heard of this place -- -curse the hour that the name first fell upon my ears ! -- -and I came to better myself ! My God ! to better myself ! My wife and three children came with me . I started a drygoods store on Market Square , and I prospered well . The word had gone round that I was a Freeman , and I was forced to join the local lodge , same as you did last night . I 've the badge of shame on my forearm and something worse branded on my heart . I found that I was under the orders of a black villain and caught in a meshwork of crime . What could I do ? Every word I said to make things better was taken as treason , same as it was last night . I ca n't get away ; for all I have in the world is in my store . If I leave the society , I know well that it means murder to me , and God knows what to my wife and children . Oh , man , it is awful -- -awful ! '' He put his hands to his face , and his body shook with convulsive sobs.McMurdo shrugged his shoulders . `` You were too soft for the job , '' said he . `` You are the wrong sort for such work . `` `` I had a conscience and a religion ; but they made me a criminal among them . I was chosen for a job . If I backed down I knew well what would come to me . Maybe I 'm a coward . Maybe it 's the
