-- -- -- '' '' You stopped , and then walked back to the garden gate , '' my companion interrupted . `` What did you do that for ? `` Rance gave a violent jump , and stared at Sherlock Holmes with the utmost amazement upon his features . `` Why , that 's true , sir , '' he said ; `` though how you come to know it , Heaven only knows . Ye see , when I got up to the door it was so still and so lonesome , that I thought I 'd be none the worse for some one with me . I ai n't afeared of anything on this side o ' the grave ; but I thought that maybe it was him that died o ' the typhoid inspecting the drains what killed him . The thought gave me a kind o ' turn , and I walked back to the gate to see if I could see Murcher 's lantern , but there was n't no sign of him nor of anyone else . `` `` There was no one in the street ? `` `` Not a livin ' soul , sir , nor as much as a dog . Then I pulled myself together and went back and pushed the door open . All was quiet inside , so I went into the room where the light was a-burnin ' . There was a candle flickerin ' on the mantelpiece -- -a red wax one -- -and by its light I saw -- -- -- '' '' Yes , I know all that you saw . You walked round the room several times , and you knelt down by the body , and then you walked through and tried the kitchen door , and then -- -- -- '' John Rance sprang to his feet with a frightened face and suspicion in his eyes . `` Where was you hid to see all that ? '' he cried . `` It seems to me that you knows a deal more than you should . `` Holmes laughed and threw his card across the table to the constable . `` Do n't get arresting me for the murder , '' he said . `` I am one of the hounds and not the wolf ; Mr. Gregson or Mr. Lestrade will answer for that . Go on , though . What did you do next ? `` Rance resumed his seat , without however losing his mystified expression . `` I went back to the gate and sounded my whistle . That brought Murcher and two more to the spot . `` `` Was the street empty then ? `` `` Well , it was , as far as anybody that could be of any good goes . `` `` What do you mean ? `` The constable 's features broadened into a grin . `` I 've seen many a drunk chap in my time , '' he said , `` but never anyone so cryin ' drunk as that cove . He was at the gate when I came out , a-leanin ' up agin the railings , and a-singin ' at the pitch o ' his lungs about Columbine 's New-fangled Banner , or some such stuff . He could n't stand , far less help . `` `` What sort of a man was he ? '' asked Sherlock Holmes.John Rance appeared to be somewhat irritated at this digression . `` He was an uncommon drunk sort o ' man , '' he said . `` He 'd ha ' found hisself in the station if we had n't been so took up . `` `` His face -- -his dress -- -did n't you notice them ? '' Holmes broke in impatiently . `` I should think I did notice them , seeing that I had to prop him up -- -me and Murcher between us . He was a long chap , with a red face , the lower part muffled round -- -- -- '' '' That will do , '' cried Holmes . `` What became of him ? `` `` We 'd enough to do without lookin ' after him , '' the policeman said , in an aggrieved voice . `` I 'll wager he found his way home all right . `` `` How was he dressed ? `` `` A brown overcoat . `` `` Had he a whip in his hand ? `` `` A whip -- -no . `` `` He must have left it behind , '' muttered my companion . `` You did n't happen to see or hear a cab after that ? '' '' No . `` `` There 's a half-sovereign for you , '' my companion said , standing up and taking his hat . `` I am afraid , Rance , that you will never rise in the force . That head of yours should be for use as well as ornament . You might have gained your sergeant 's stripes last night . The man whom you held in your hands is the man who holds the clue of this mystery , and whom we are seeking . There is no use of arguing about it now ; I tell you that it is so . Come along , Doctor . `` We started off for the cab together , leaving our informant incredulous , but obviously uncomfortable . `` The blundering fool , '' Holmes said , bitterly , as we drove back to our lodgings . `` Just to think of his having such an incomparable bit of good luck , and not taking advantage of it . `` `` I am rather in the dark still . It is true that the description of this man tallies with your idea of the second party in this mystery . But why should he come back to the house after leaving it ? That is not the way of criminals . `` `` The ring , man , the ring : that was what he came back for . If we have no other way of catching him , we can always bait our line with the ring . I shall have him , Doctor -- -I 'll lay you two to one that I have him . I must thank you for it all . I might not have gone but for you , and so have missed the finest study I ever came across : a study in scarlet , eh ? Why should n't we use a little art jargon . There 's the scarlet thread of murder running through the colourless skein of life , and our duty is to unravel it , and isolate it , and expose every inch of it . And now for lunch , and then for Norman Neruda . Her attack and her bowing are splendid . What 's that little thing of Chopin 's she plays so magnificently : Tra-la-la-lira-lira-lay . `` Leaning back in the cab , this amateur bloodhound carolled away like a lark while I meditated upon the many-sidedness of the human mind.OUR morning 's exertions had been too much for my weak health , and I was tired out in the afternoon . After Holmes ' departure for the concert , I lay down upon the sofa and endeavoured to get a couple of hours ' sleep . It was a useless attempt . My mind had been too much excited by all that had occurred , and the strangest fancies and surmises crowded into it . Every time that I closed my eyes I saw before me the distorted baboon-like countenance of the murdered man . So sinister was the impression which that face had produced upon me that I found it difficult to feel anything but gratitude for him who had removed its owner from the world . If ever human features bespoke vice of the most malignant type , they were certainly those of Enoch J. Drebber , of Cleveland . Still I recognized that justice must be done , and that the depravity of the victim was no condonment 11 in the eyes of the law.The more I thought of it the more extraordinary did my companion 's hypothesis , that the man had been poisoned , appear . I remembered how he had sniffed his lips , and had no doubt that he had detected something which had given rise to the idea . Then , again , if not poison , what had caused the man 's death , since there was neither wound nor marks of strangulation ? But , on the other hand , whose blood was that which lay so thickly upon the floor ? There were no signs of a struggle , nor had the victim any weapon with which he might have wounded an antagonist . As long as all these questions were unsolved , I felt that sleep would be no easy matter , either for Holmes or myself . His quiet self-confident manner convinced me that he had already formed a theory which explained all the facts , though what it was I could not for an instant conjecture.He was very late in returning -- -so late , that I knew that the concert could not have detained him all the time . Dinner was on the table before he appeared . `` It was magnificent , '' he said , as he took his seat . `` Do you remember what Darwin says about music ? He claims that the power of producing and appreciating it existed among the human race long before the power of speech was arrived at . Perhaps that is why we are so subtly influenced by it . There are vague memories in our souls of those misty centuries when the world was in its childhood . `` `` That 's rather a broad idea , '' I remarked . `` One 's ideas must be as broad as Nature if they are to interpret Nature , '' he answered . `` What 's the matter ? You 're not looking quite yourself . This Brixton Road affair has upset you . `` `` To tell the truth , it has , '' I said . `` I ought to be more case-hardened after my Afghan experiences . I saw my own comrades hacked to pieces at Maiwand without losing my nerve . `` `` I can understand . There is a mystery about this which stimulates the imagination ; where there is no imagination there is no horror . Have you seen the evening paper ? '' '' No . `` `` It gives a fairly good account of the affair . It does not mention the fact that when the man was raised up , a woman 's wedding ring fell upon the floor . It is just as well it does not. '' '' Why ? `` `` Look at this advertisement , '' he answered . `` I had one sent to every paper this morning immediately after the affair . `` He threw the paper across to me and I glanced at the place indicated . It was the first announcement in the `` Found '' column . `` In Brixton Road , this morning , '' it ran , `` a plain gold wedding ring , found in the roadway between the 'White Hart ' Tavern and Holland Grove . Apply Dr. Watson , 221B , Baker Street , between eight and nine this evening . `` `` Excuse my using your name , '' he said . `` If I used my own some of these dunderheads would recognize it , and want to meddle
