are the strangest pieces of flotsam and jetsam that were ever thrown upon this coast , '' I remarked . `` My father will be mightily interested in them . `` `` Indeed , I think the less you have to do with them the better for you , '' said the mate . `` If I do command my own ship I 'll promise you that I never carry live stock of that sort on board of her . But here we are all aboard and the anchor tripped , so we must bid you good-bye . `` The wagonette had just finished loading up when we arrived , and the chief places , on either side of the driver , had been reserved for my two companions , who speedily sprang into them . With a chorus of cheers the good fellows whirled away down the road , while my father , Esther , and I stood upon the lawn and waved our hands to them until they disappeared behind the Cloomber woods , en routefor the Wigtown railway station . Barque and crew had both vanished now from our little world , the only relic of either being the heaps ofdebrisupon the beach , which were to lie there until the arrival of an agent from Lloyd's.At dinner that evening I mentioned to my father the episode of the three Buddhist priests , and found , as I had expected , that he was very much interested by my account of them.When , however , he heard of the high manner in which Ram Singh had spoken of him , and the distinguished position which he had assigned him among philologists , he became so excited that it was all we could do to prevent him from setting off then and there to make his acquaintance.Esther and I were relieved and glad when we at last succeeded in abstracting his boots and manoeuvring him to his bedroom , for the exciting events of the last twenty-four hours had been too much for his weak frame and delicate nerves.I was sitting at the open porch in the gloaming , turning over in my mind the unexpected events which had occurred so rapidly -- -the gale , the wreck , the rescue , and the strange character of the castaways -- -when my sister came quietly over to me and put her hand in mine . `` Do n't you think , Jack , '' she said , in her low , sweet voice , `` that we are forgetting our friends over at Cloomber ? Has n't all this excitement driven their fears and their danger out of our heads ? `` `` Out of our heads , but never out of our hearts , '' said I , laughing . `` However , you are right , little one , for our attention has certainly been distracted from them . I shall walk up in the morning and see if I can see anything of them . By the way , to-morrow is the fateful 5th of October -- -one more day , and all will be well with us . `` `` Or ill , '' said my sister gloomily . `` Why , what a little croaker you are , to be sure ! '' I cried . `` What in the world is coming over you ? `` `` I feel nervous and low-spirited , '' she answered , drawing closer to my side and shivering . `` I feel as if some great peril were hanging over the heads of those we love . Why should these strange men wish to stay upon the coast ? `` `` What , the Buddhists ? '' I said lightly . `` Oh , these fellows have continual feast-days and religious rites of all sorts . They have some very good reason for staying , you may be sure . `` `` Do n't you think , '' said Esther , in an awe-struck whisper , `` that it is very strange that these priests should arrive here all the way from India just at the present moment ? Have you not gathered from all you have heard that the general 's fears are in some way connected with India and the Indians ? `` The remark made me thoughtful . `` Why , now that you mention it , '' I answered , `` I have some vague impression that the mystery is connected with some incident which occurred in that country . I am sure , however , that your fears would vanish if you saw Ram Singh . He is the very personification of wisdom and benevolence . He was shocked at the idea of our killing a sheep , or even a fish for his benefit -- -said he would rather die than have a hand in taking the life of an animal . `` `` It is very foolish of me to be so nervous , '' said my sister bravely . `` But you must promise me one thing , Jack . You will go up to Cloomber in the morning , and if you can see any of them you must tell them of these strange neighbours of ours . They are better able to judge than we are whether their presence has any significance or not . `` `` All right , little one , '' I answered , as we went indoors . `` You have been over-excited by all these wild doings , and you need a sound night 's rest to compose you . I 'll do what you suggest , however , and our friends shall judge for themselves whether these poor fellows should be sent about their business or not . `` I made the promise to allay my sister 's apprehensions , but in the bright sunlight of morning it appeared less than absurd to imagine that our poor vegetarian castaways could have any sinister intentions , or that their advent could have any effect upon the tenant of Cloomber.I was anxious , myself , however , to see whether I could see anything of the Heatherstones , so after breakfast I walked up to the Hall . In their seclusion it was impossible for them to have learnt anything of the recent events . I felt , therefore , that even if I should meet the general he could hardly regard me as an intruder while I had so much news to communicate.The place had the same dreary and melancholy appearance which always characterised it . Looking through between the thick iron bars of the main gateway there was nothing to be seen of any of the occupants . One of the great Scotch firs had been blown down in the gale , and its long , ruddy trunk lay right across the grass-grown avenue ; but no attempt had been made to remove it.Everything about the property had the same air of desolation and neglect , with the solitary exception of the massive and impenetrable fencing , which presented as unbroken and formidable an obstacle as ever to the would-be trespasser.I walked round this barrier as far as our old trysting-place without finding any flaw through which I could get a glimpse of the house , for the fence had been repaired with each rail overlapping the last , so as to secure absolute privacy for those inside , and to block those peep-holes which I had formerly used.At the old spot , however , where I had had the memorable interview with the general on the occasion when he surprised me with his daughter , I found that the two loose rails had been refixed in such a manner that there was a gap of two inches or more between them.Through this I had a view of the house and of part of the lawn in front of it , and , though I could see no signs of life outside or at any of the windows , I settled down with the intention of sticking to my post until I had a chance of speaking to one or other of the inmates . Indeed , the cold , dead aspect of the house had struck such a chill into my heart that I determined to scale the fence at whatever risk of incurring the general 's displeasure rather than return without news of the Heatherstones.Happily there was no need of this extreme expedient , for I had not been there half-an-hour before I heard the harsh sound of an opening lock , and the general himself emerged from the main door.To my surprise he was dressed in a military uniform , and that not the uniform in ordinary use in the British Army . The red coat was strangely cut and stained with the weather . The trousers had originally been white , but had now faded to a dirty yellow . With a red sash across his chest and a straight sword hanging from his side , he stood the living example of a bygone type -- -the John Company 's officer of forty years ago.He was followed by the ex-tramp , Corporal Rufus Smith , now well-clad and prosperous , who limped along beside his master , the two pacing up and down the lawn absorbed in conversation . I observed that from time to time one or other of them would pause and glance furtively all about them , as though guarding keenly against a surprise . I should have preferred communicating with the general alone , but since there was no dissociating him from his companion , I beat loudly on the fencing with my stick to attract their attention . They both faced round in a moment , and I could see from their gestures that they were disturbed and alarmed.I then elevated my stick above the barrier to show them where the sound proceeded from . At this the general began to walk in my direction with the air of a man who is bracing himself up for an effort , but the other caught him by the wrist and endeavoured to dissuade him.It was only when I shouted out my name and assured them that I was alone that I could prevail upon them to approach . Once assured of my identity the general ran eagerly towards me and greeted me with the utmost cordiality . `` This is truly kind of you , West , '' he said . `` It is only at such times as these that one can judge who is a friend and who not . It would not be fair to you to ask you to come inside or to stay any time , but I am none the less very glad to see you . `` `` I have been anxious about you all , '' I said , `` for it is some little time since I have seen or heard from any of you . How have you all been keeping ? `` `` Why , as well as could be expected . But we will be better tomorrow -- -we will be different men to-morrow , eh , Corporal ? `` `` Yes , sir , '' said the corporal , raising his hand to his forehead in a military salute . `` We 'll be right as the bank to-morrow . `` `` The corporal and I are a little disturbed in our minds just now , '' the general explained , `` but I have no doubt that all will come right . After all , there is nothing higher than Providence , and we are all in His hands . And how have you been , eh ? `` `` We have been very busy for one thing
