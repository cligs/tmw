a round with Aylward ; but , though a silver shilling was to be the prize of the victory , it has never been reported that any man earned much money in that fashion . So they lived , these men , in their own lusty , cheery fashion -- -rude and rough , but honest , kindly and true . Let us thank God if we have outgrown their vices . Let us pray to God that we may ever hold their virtues . The sky may darken , and the clouds may gather , and again the day may come when Britain may have sore need of her children , on whatever shore of the sea they be found . Shall they not muster at her call ?
