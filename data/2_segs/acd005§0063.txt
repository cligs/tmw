has no sense . Unless we warn them at Sainte Marie , these devils will lay some trap for them . Their parties are assembling by land and by water , and there may be a thousand before daybreak . Our duty is to push on and give our warning . `` `` He speaks the truth , '' said Amos to Ephraim . `` Nay , but you must not go alone ! '' He seized the stout old seaman by the arm and held him by main force to prevent him from breaking off through the woods . `` There is one thing which we can do to spoil their night 's amusement , '' said Du Lhut . `` The woods are as dry as powder , and there has been no drop of rain for a long three months. '' '' Yes ? `` `` And the wind blows straight for their camp , with the river on the other side of it . `` `` We should fire the woods ! `` `` We can not do better . `` In an instant Du Lhut had scraped together a little bundle of dry twigs , and had heaped them up against a withered beech tree which was as dry as tinder . A stroke of flint and steel was enough to start a little smoulder of flame , which lengthened and spread until it was leaping along the white strips of hanging bark . A quarter of a mile farther on Du Lhut did the same again , and once more beyond that , until at three different points the forest was in a blaze . As they hurried onwards they could hear the dull roaring of the flames behind them , and at last , as they neared Sainte Marie , they could see , looking back , the long rolling wave of fire travelling ever westward towards the Richelieu , and flashing up into great spouts of flame as it licked up a clump of pines as if it were a bundle of faggots . Du Lhut chuckled in his silent way as he looked back at the long orange glare in the sky . `` They will need to swim for it , some of them , '' said he . `` They have not canoes to take them all off . Ah , if I had but two hundred of mycoureurs-de-boison the river at the farther side of them not one would have got away . `` `` They had one who was dressed like a white man , '' remarked Amos . `` Ay , and the most deadly of the lot . His father was a Dutch trader , his mother an Iroquois , and he goes by the name of the Flemish Bastard . Ah , I know him well , and I tell you that if they want a king in hell , they will find one all ready in his wigwam . By Saint Anne , I have a score to settle with him , and I may pay it before this business is over . Well , there are the lights of Sainte Marie shining down below there . I can understand that sigh of relief , monsieur , for , on my word , after what we found at Poitou , I was uneasy myself until I should see them . `` Day was just breaking as the four comrades entered the gate of the stockade , but early as it was thecensitairesand their families were all afoot staring at the prodigious fire which raged to the south of them . De Catinat burst through the throng and rushed upstairs to Adele , who had herself flown down to meet him , so that they met in each other 's arms half-way up the great stone staircase with a burst of those little inarticulate cries which are the true unwritten language of love . Together , with his arm round her , they ascended to the great hall where old De la Noue with his son were peering out of the window at the wonderful spectacle . `` Ah , monsieur , '' said the old nobleman , with his courtly bow , `` I am indeed rejoiced to see you safe under my roof again , not only for your own sake , but for that of madame 's eyes , which , if she will permit an old man to say so , are much too pretty to spoil by straining them all day in the hopes of seeing some one coming out of the forest . You have done forty miles , Monsieur de Catinat , and are doubtless hungry and weary . When you are yourself again I must claim my revenge in piquet , for the cards lay against me the other night . `` But Du Lhut had entered at De Catinat 's heels with his tidings of disaster . `` You will have another game to play , Monsieur de Sainte-Marie , '' said he . `` There are six hundred Iroquois in the woods and they are preparing to attack . `` `` Tut , tut , we can not allow our arrangements to be altered by a handful of savages , '' said the seigneur . `` I must apologise to you , my dear De Catinat , that you should be annoyed by such people while you are upon my estate . As regards the piquet , I can not but think that your play from king and knave is more brilliant than safe . Now when I played piquet last with De Lannes of Poitou -- - '' '' De Lannes of Poitou is dead , and all his people , '' said Du Lhut . `` The blockhouse is a heap of smoking ashes . `` The seigneur raised his eyebrows and took a pinch of snuff , tapping the lid of his little round gold box . `` I always told him that his fort would be taken unless he cleared away those maple trees which grew up to the very walls . They are all dead , you say ? `` `` Every man . `` `` And the fort burned ? `` `` Not a stick was left standing . `` `` Have you seen these rascals ? `` `` We saw the trail of a hundred and fifty . Then there were a hundred in canoes , and a war-party of four hundred passed us under the Flemish Bastard . Their camp is five miles down the river , and there can not be less than six hundred . `` `` You were fortunate in escaping them . `` `` But they were not so fortunate in escaping us . We killed Brown Moose and his son , and we fired the woods so as to drive them out of their camp. '' '' Excellent ! Excellent ! '' said the seigneur , clapping gently with his dainty hands . `` You have done very well indeed , Du Lhut ! You are , I presume , very tired ? `` `` I am not often tired . I am quite ready to do the journey again . `` `` Then perhaps you would pick a few men and go back into the woods to see what these villains are doing ? `` `` I shall be ready in five minutes . `` `` Perhaps you would like to go also , Achille ? '' His son 's dark eyes andIndian face lit up with a fierce joy . `` Yes , I shall go also , '' he answered . `` Very good , and we shall make all ready in your absence . Madame , you will excuse these little annoyances which mar the pleasure of your visit . Next time that you do me the honour to come here I trust that we shall have cleared all these vermin from my estate . We have our advantages . The Richelieu is a better fish pond , and these forests are a finer deer preserve than any of which the king can boast . But on the other hand we have , as you see , our little troubles . You will excuse me now , as there are one or two things which demand my attention . De Catinat , you are a tried soldier and I should be glad of your advice . Onega , give me my lace handkerchief and my cane of clouded amber , and take care of madame until her husband and I return . `` It was bright daylight now , and the square enclosure within the stockade was filled with an anxious crowd who had just learned the evil tidings . Most of thecensitaireswere old soldiers and trappers who had served in many Indian wars , and whose swarthy faces and bold bearing told their own story . They were sons of a race which with better fortune or with worse has burned more powder than any other nation upon earth , and as they stood in little groups discussing the situation and examining their arms , a leader could have asked for no more hardy or more war-like following . The women , however , pale and breathless , were hurrying in from the outlying cottages , dragging their children with them , and bearing over their shoulders the more precious of their household goods . The confusion , the hurry , the cries of the children , the throwing down of bundles and the rushing back for more , contrasted sharply with the quiet and the beauty of the woods which encircled them , all bathed in the bright morning sunlight . It was strange to look upon the fairy loveliness of their many-tinted foliage , and to know that the spirit of murder and cruelty was roaming unchained behind that lovely screen.The scouting party under Du Lhut and Achille de la Noue had already left , and at the order of the seigneur the two gates were now secured with huge bars of oak fitted into iron staples on either side . The children were placed in the lower store-room with a few women to watch them , while the others were told off to attend to the fire buckets , and to reload the muskets . The men had been paraded , fifty-two of them in all , and they were divided into parties now for the defence of each part of the stockade . On one side it had been built up to within a few yards of the river , which not only relieved them from the defence of that face , but enabled them to get fresh water by throwing a bucket at the end of a rope from the stockade . The boats and canoes of Sainte Marie were drawn up on the bank just under the wall , and were precious now as offering a last means of escape should all else fail . The next fort , St. Louis , was but a few leagues up the river , and De la Noue had already sent a swift messenger to them with news of the danger . At least it would be a point on which they might retreat should the worst come to the worst . And that the worst might come to the worst was very evident to so experienced a woodsman as Amos Green . He had left Ephraim Savage snoring in a deep sleep upon the floor , and was now walking round the defences with his pipe in his mouth , examining with a critical eye every detail in connection with them . The stockade was very strong , nine feet high and
