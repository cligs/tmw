IN the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the University of London , and proceeded to Netley to go through the course prescribed for surgeons in the army . Having completed my studies there , I was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant Surgeon . The regiment was stationed in India at the time , and before I could join it , the second Afghan war had broken out . On landing at Bombay , I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes , and was already deep in the enemy 's country . I followed , however , with many other officers who were in the same situation as myself , and succeeded in reaching Candahar in safety , where I found my regiment , and at once entered upon my new duties.The campaign brought honours and promotion to many , but for me it had nothing but misfortune and disaster . I was removed from my brigade and attached to the Berkshires , with whom I served at the fatal battle of Maiwand . There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet , which shattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery . I should have fallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the devotion and courage shown by Murray , my orderly , who threw me across a pack-horse , and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.Worn with pain , and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had undergone , I was removed , with a great train of wounded sufferers , to the base hospital at Peshawar . Here I rallied , and had already improved so far as to be able to walk about the wards , and even to bask a little upon the verandah , when I was struck down by enteric fever , that curse of our Indian possessions . For months my life was despaired of , and when at last I came to myself and became convalescent , I was so weak and emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be lost in sending me back to England . I was dispatched , accordingly , in the troopship `` Orontes , '' and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty , with my health irretrievably ruined , but with permission from a paternal government to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it.I had neither kith nor kin in England , and was therefore as free as air -- -or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will permit a man to be . Under such circumstances , I naturally gravitated to London , that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of the Empire are irresistibly drained . There I stayed for some time at a private hotel in the Strand , leading a comfortless , meaningless existence , and spending such money as I had , considerably more freely than I ought . So alarming did the state of my finances become , that I soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate somewhere in the country , or that I must make a complete alteration in my style of living . Choosing the latter alternative , I began by making up my mind to leave the hotel , and to take up my quarters in some less pretentious and less expensive domicile.On the very day that I had come to this conclusion , I was standing at the Criterion Bar , when some one tapped me on the shoulder , and turning round I recognized young Stamford , who had been a dresser under me at Barts . The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London is a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man . In old days Stamford had never been a particular crony of mine , but now I hailed him with enthusiasm , and he , in his turn , appeared to be delighted to see me . In the exuberance of my joy , I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn , and we started off together in a hansom . `` Whatever have you been doing with yourself , Watson ? '' he asked in undisguised wonder , as we rattled through the crowded London streets . `` You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut . `` I gave him a short sketch of my adventures , and had hardly concluded it by the time that we reached our destination . `` Poor devil ! '' he said , commiseratingly , after he had listened to my misfortunes . `` What are you up to now ? `` `` Looking for lodgings . '' 3 I answered . `` Trying to solve the problem as to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable price . `` `` That 's a strange thing , '' remarked my companion ; `` you are the second man to-day that has used that expression to me . `` `` And who was the first ? '' I asked . `` A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital . He was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone to go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found , and which were too much for his purse . `` `` By Jove ! '' I cried , `` if he really wants someone to share the rooms and the expense , I am the very man for him . I should prefer having a partner to being alone . `` Young Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass . `` You do n't know Sherlock Holmes yet , '' he said ; `` perhaps you would not care for him as a constant companion . `` `` Why , what is there against him ? `` `` Oh , I did n't say there was anything against him . He is a little queer in his ideas -- -an enthusiast in some branches of science . As far as I know he is a decent fellow enough . `` `` A medical student , I suppose ? '' said I . `` No -- -I have no idea what he intends to go in for . I believe he is well up in anatomy , and he is a first-class chemist ; but , as far as I know , he has never taken out any systematic medical classes . His studies are very desultory and eccentric , but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the way knowledge which would astonish his professors . `` `` Did you never ask him what he was going in for ? '' I asked . `` No ; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out , though he can be communicative enough when the fancy seizes him . `` `` I should like to meet him , '' I said . `` If I am to lodge with anyone , I should prefer a man of studious and quiet habits . I am not strong enough yet to stand much noise or excitement . I had enough of both in Afghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence . How could I meet this friend of yours ? `` `` He is sure to be at the laboratory , '' returned my companion . `` He either avoids the place for weeks , or else he works there from morning to night . If you like , we shall drive round together after luncheon . `` `` Certainly , '' I answered , and the conversation drifted away into other channels.As we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn , Stamford gave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to take as a fellow-lodger . `` You must n't blame me if you do n't get on with him , '' he said ; `` I know nothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally in the laboratory . You proposed this arrangement , so you must not hold me responsible . `` `` If we do n't get on it will be easy to part company , '' I answered . `` It seems to me , Stamford , '' I added , looking hard at my companion , `` that you have some reason for washing your hands of the matter . Is this fellow 's temper so formidable , or what is it ? Do n't be mealy-mouthed about it . `` `` It is not easy to express the inexpressible , '' he answered with a laugh . `` Holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes -- -it approaches to cold-bloodedness . I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch of the latest vegetable alkaloid , not out of malevolence , you understand , but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea of the effects . To do him justice , I think that he would take it himself with the same readiness . He appears to have a passion for definite and exact knowledge . `` `` Very right too . `` `` Yes , but it may be pushed to excess . When it comes to beating the subjects in the dissecting-rooms with a stick , it is certainly taking rather a bizarre shape . `` `` Beating the subjects ! `` `` Yes , to verify how far bruises may be produced after death . I saw him at it with my own eyes . `` `` And yet you say he is not a medical student ? '' '' No . Heaven knows what the objects of his studies are . But here we are , and you must form your own impressions about him . '' As he spoke , we turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small side-door , which opened into a wing of the great hospital . It was familiar ground to me , and I needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone staircase and made our way down the long corridor with its vista of whitewashed wall and dun-coloured doors . Near the further end a low arched passage branched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory.This was a lofty chamber , lined and littered with countless bottles . Broad , low tables were scattered about , which bristled with retorts , test-tubes , and little Bunsen lamps , with their blue flickering flames . There was only one student in the room , who was bending over a distant table absorbed in his work . At the sound of our steps he glanced round and sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure . `` I 've found it ! I 've found it , '' he shouted to my companion , running towards us with a test-tube in his hand . `` I have found a re-agent which is precipitated by hoemoglobin , 4 and by nothing else . '' Had he discovered a gold mine , greater delight could not have shone upon his features. '' Dr . Watson , Mr. Sherlock Holmes , '' said Stamford , introducing us . `` How are you ? '' he said cordially , gripping my hand with a strength for which I should hardly have given him credit . `` You have been in Afghanistan , I perceive . `` `` How on earth did you know
