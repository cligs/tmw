rails could be removed without difficulty , leaving a broad gap , which gave us the opportunity for many a stolen interview , though they were necessarily short , for the general 's movements were erratic , and no part of the grounds was secure from his visitations.How vividly one of these hurried meetings rises before me ! It stands out clear , peaceful , and distinct amid the wild , mysterious incidents which were destined to lead up to the terrible catastrophe which has cast a shade over our lives.I can remember that as I walked through the fields the grass was damp with the rain of the morning , and the air was heavy with the smell of the fresh-turned earth . Gabriel was waiting for me under the hawthorn tree outside the gap , and we stood hand-in-hand looking down at the long sweep of moorland and at the broad blue channel which encircled it with its fringe of foam.Far away in the north-west the sun glinted upon the high peak of Mount Throston . From where we stood we could see the smoke of the steamers as they ploughed along the busy water-way which leads to Belfast . `` Is it not magnificent ? '' Gabriel cried , clasping her hands round my arm . `` Ah , John , why are we not free to sail away over these waves together , and leave all our troubles behind us on the shore ? `` `` And what are the troubles which you would leave behind you , dear one ? '' I asked . `` May I not know them , and help you to bear them ? `` `` I have no secrets from you , John , '' she answered . `` Our chief trouble is , as you may guess , our poor father 's strange behaviour . Is it not a sad thing for all of us that a man who has played such a distinguished part in the world should skulk from one obscure corner of the country to another , and should defend himself with locks and barriers as though he were a common thief flying from justice ? This is a trouble , John , which it is out of your power to alleviate . `` `` But why does he do it , Gabriel ? '' I asked . `` I can not tell , '' she answered frankly . `` I only know that he imagines some deadly danger to be hanging over his head , and that this danger was incurred by him during his stay in India . What its nature may be I have no more idea than you have . `` `` Then your brother has , '' I remarked . `` I am sure from the way in which he spoke to me about it one day that he knows what it is , and that he looks upon it as real . `` `` Yes , he knows , and so does my mother , '' she answered , `` but they have always kept it secret from me . My poor father is very excited at present . Day and night he is in an agony of apprehension , but it will soon be the fifth of October , and after that he will be at peace . `` `` How do you know that ? '' I asked in surprise . `` By experience , '' she answered gravely . `` On the fifth of October these fears of his come to a crisis . For years back he has been in the habit of locking Mordaunt and myself up in our rooms on that date , so that we have no idea what occurs , but we have always found that he has been much relieved afterwards , and has continued to be comparatively in peace until that day begins to draw round again . `` `` Then you have only ten days or so to wait , '' I remarked , for September was drawing to a close . `` By the way , dearest , why is it that you light up all your rooms at night ? `` `` You have noticed it , then ? '' she said . `` It comes also from my father 's fears . He does not like to have one dark corner in the whole house . He walks about a good deal at night , and inspects everything , from the attics right down to the cellars . He has large lamps in every room and corridor , even the empty ones , and he orders the servants to light them all at dusk . `` `` I am rather surprised that you manage to keep your servants , '' I said , laughing . `` The maids in these parts are a superstitious class , and their imaginations are easily excited by anything which they do n't understand . `` `` The cook and both housemaids are from London , and are used to our ways . We pay them on a very high scale to make up for any inconvenience to which they may be put . Israel Stakes , the coachman , is the only one who comes from this part of the country , and he seems to be a stolid , honest fellow , who is not easily scared . `` `` Poor little girl , '' I exclaimed , looking down at the slim , graceful figure by my side . `` This is no atmosphere for you to live in . Why will you not let me rescue you from it ? Why wo n't you allow me to go straight and ask the general for your hand ? At the worst he could only refuse . `` She turned quite haggard and pale at the very thought . `` For Heaven 's sake , John , '' she cried earnestly , `` do nothing of the kind . He would whip us all away in the dead of the night , and within a week we should be settling down again in some wilderness where we might never have a chance of seeing or hearing from you again . Besides , he never would forgive us for venturing out of the grounds . `` `` I do n't think that he is a hard-hearted man , '' I remarked . `` I have seen a kindly look in his eyes , for all his stern face . `` `` He can be the kindest of fathers , '' she answered . `` But he is terrible when opposed or thwarted . You have never seen him so , and I trust you never will . It was that strength of will and impatience of opposition which made him such a splendid officer . I assure you that in India every one thought a great deal of him . The soldiers were afraid of him , but they would have followed him anywhere . `` `` And had he these nervous attacks then ? `` `` Occasionally , but not nearly so acutely . He seems to think that the danger -- -whatever it may be -- -becomes more imminent every year . Oh , John , it is terrible to be waiting like this with a sword over our heads -- -and all the more terrible to me since I have no idea where the blow is to come from . `` `` Dear Gabriel , '' I said , taking her hand and drawing her to my side , `` look over all this pleasant countryside and the broad blue sea . Is it not all peaceful and beautiful ? In these cottages , with their red-tiled roofs peeping out from the grey moor , there live none but simple , God-fearing men , who toil hard at their crafts and bear enmity to no man . Within seven miles of us is a large town , with every civilised appliance for the preservation of order . Ten miles farther there is a garrison quartered , and a telegram would at any time bring down a company of soldiers . Now , I ask you , dear , in the name of common-sense , what conceivable danger could threaten you in this secluded neighbourhood , with the means of help so near ? You assure me that the peril is not connected with your father 's health ? `` `` No , I am sure of that . It is true that Dr. Easterling , of Stranraer , has been over to see him once or twice , but that was merely for some small indisposition . I can assure you that the danger is not to be looked for in that direction . `` `` Then I can assure you , '' said I , laughing , `` that there is no danger at all . It must be some strange monomania or hallucination . No other hypothesis will cover the facts . `` `` Would my father 's monomania account for the fact of my brother 's hair turning grey and my mother wasting away to a mere shadow ? `` `` Undoubtedly , '' I answered . `` The long continued worry of the general 's restlessness and irritability would produce those effects on sensitive natures . `` `` No , no ! '' said she , shaking her head sadly , `` I have been exposed to his restlessness and irritability , but they have had no such effect upon me . The difference between us lies in the fact that they know this awful secret and I do not . `` `` My dear girl , '' said I , `` the days of family apparitions and that kind of thing are gone . Nobody is haunted nowadays , so we can put that supposition out of the question . Having done so , what remains ? There is absolutely no other theory which could even be suggested . Believe me , the whole mystery is that the heat of India has been too much for your poor father 's brain . `` What she would have answered I can not tell , for at that moment she gave a start as if some sound had fallen upon her ear . As she looked round apprehensively , I suddenly saw her features become rigid and her eyes fixed and dilated.Following the direction of her gaze , I felt a sudden thrill of fear pass through me as I perceived a human face surveying us from behind one of the trees -- -a man 's face , every feature of which was distorted by the most malignant hatred and anger . Finding himself observed , he stepped out and advanced towards us , when I saw that it was none other than the general himself . His beard was all a-bristle with fury , and his deepset eyes glowed from under their heavily veined lids with a most sinister and demoniacal brightness . `` To your room , girl ! '' he cried in a hoarse , harsh voice , stepping in between us and pointing authoritatively towards the house.He waited until Gabriel , with a last frightened glance at me , had passed through the gap , and then he turned upon me with an expression so murderous that I stepped back a pace or two , and tightened my grasp upon my oak stick . `` You-you -- - '' he spluttered , with his hand twitching at his throat , as though his fury were choking him . `` You have dared to intrude upon my privacy ! Do you think I built this fence that all the vermin in
