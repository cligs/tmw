Guesclin moodily , as he raised her drooping head with his strong brown hand . `` Wine for the lady , squire ! The blessed hour of sight hath passed . `` It was late ere Alleyne Edricson , having carried Sir Nigel the goblet of spiced wine which it was his custom to drink after the curling of his hair , was able at last to seek his chamber . It was a stone-flagged room upon the second floor , with a bed in a recess for him , and two smaller pallets on the other side , on which Aylward and Hordle John were already snoring . Alleyne had knelt down to his evening orisons , when there came a tap at his door , and Ford entered with a small lamp in his hand . His face was deadly pale , and his hand shook until the shadows flickered up and down the wall . `` What is it , Ford ? '' cried Alleyne , springing to his feet . `` I can scarce tell you , '' said he , sitting down on the side of the couch , and resting his chin upon his hand . `` I know not what to say or what to think . `` `` Has aught befallen you , then ? `` `` Yes , or I have been slave to my own fancy . I tell you , lad , that I am all undone , like a fretted bow-string . Hark hither , Alleyne ! it can not be that you have forgotten little Tita , the daughter of the old glass-stainer at Bordeaux ? `` `` I remember her well . `` `` She and I , Alleyne , broke the lucky groat together ere we parted , and she wears my ring upon her finger . 'Caro mio , ' quoth she when last we parted , 'I shall be near thee in the wars , and thy danger will be my danger . ' Alleyne , as God is my help , as I came up the stairs this night I saw her stand before me , her face in tears , her hands out as though in warning -- -I saw it , Alleyne , even as I see those two archers upon their couches . Our very finger-tips seemed to meet , ere she thinned away like a mist in the sunshine . `` `` I would not give overmuch thought to it , '' answered Alleyne . `` Our minds will play us strange pranks , and bethink you that these words of the Lady Tiphaine Du Guesclin have wrought upon us and shaken us . `` Ford shook his head . `` I saw little Tita as clearly as though I were back at the Rue des Apotres at Bordeaux , '' said he . `` But the hour is late , and I must go . `` `` Where do you sleep , then ? `` `` In the chamber above you . May the saints be with us all ! '' He rose from the couch and left the chamber , while Alleyne could hear his feet sounding upon the winding stair . The young squire walked across to the window and gazed out at the moonlit landscape , his mind absorbed by the thought of the Lady Tiphaine , and of the strange words that she had spoken as to what was going forward at Castle Twynham . Leaning his elbows upon the stonework , he was deeply plunged in reverie , when in a moment his thoughts were brought back to Villefranche and to the scene before him.The window at which he stood was in the second floor of that portion of the castle which was nearest to the keep . In front lay the broad moat , with the moon lying upon its surface , now clear and round , now drawn lengthwise as the breeze stirred the waters . Beyond , the plain sloped down to a thick wood , while further to the left a second wood shut out the view . Between the two an open glade stretched , silvered in the moonshine , with the river curving across the lower end of it.As he gazed , he saw of a sudden a man steal forth from the wood into the open clearing . He walked with his head sunk , his shoulders curved , and his knees bent , as one who strives hard to remain unseen . Ten paces from the fringe of trees he glanced around , and waving his hand he crouched down , and was lost to sight among a belt of furze-bushes . After him there came a second man , and after him a third , a fourth , and a fifth stealing across the narrow open space and darting into the shelter of the brushwood . Nine-and-seventy Alleyne counted of these dark figures flitting across the line of the moonlight . Many bore huge burdens upon their backs , though what it was that they carried he could not tell at the distance . Out of the one wood and into the other they passed , all with the same crouching , furtive gait , until the black bristle of trees had swallowed up the last of them.For a moment Alleyne stood in the window , still staring down at the silent forest , uncertain as to what he should think of these midnight walkers . Then he bethought him that there was one beside him who was fitter to judge on such a matter . His fingers had scarce rested upon Aylward 's shoulder ere the bowman was on his feet , with his hand outstretched to his sword . `` Qui va ? '' he cried . `` Hola ! mon petit . By my hilt ! I thought there had been a camisade . What then , mon gar. ? `` `` Come hither by the window , Aylward , '' said Alleyne . `` I have seen four-score men pass from yonder shaw across the glade , and nigh every man of them had a great burden on his back . What think you of it ? `` `` I think nothing of it , mon camarade ! There are as many masterless folk in this country as there are rabbits on Cowdray Down , and there are many who show their faces by night but would dance in a hempen collar if they stirred forth in the day . On all the French marches are droves of outcasts , reivers , spoilers , and draw-latches , of whom I judge that these are some , though I marvel that they should dare to come so nigh to the castle of the seneschal . All seems very quiet now , '' he added , peering out of the window . `` They are in the further wood , '' said Alleyne . `` And there they may bide . Back to rest , mon petit ; for , by my hilt ! each day now will bring its own work . Yet it would be well to shoot the bolt in yonder door when one is in strange quarters . So ! '' He threw himself down upon his pallet and in an instant was fast asleep.It might have been about three o'clock in the morning when Alleyne was aroused from a troubled sleep by a low cry or exclamation . He listened , but , as he heard no more , he set it down as the challenge of the guard upon the walls , and dropped off to sleep once more . A few minutes later he was disturbed by a gentle creaking of his own door , as though some one were pushing cautiously against it , and immediately afterwards he heard the soft thud of cautious footsteps upon the stair which led to the room above , followed by a confused noise and a muffled groan . Alleyne sat up on his couch with all his nerves in a tingle , uncertain whether these sounds might come from a simple cause -- -some sick archer and visiting leech perhaps -- -or whether they might have a more sinister meaning . But what danger could threaten them here in this strong castle , under the care of famous warriors , with high walls and a broad moat around them ? Who was there that could injure them ? He had well-nigh persuaded himself that his fears were a foolish fancy , when his eyes fell upon that which sent the blood cold to his heart and left him gasping , with hands clutching at the counterpane.Right in front of him was the broad window of the chamber , with the moon shining brightly through it . For an instant something had obscured the light , and now a head was bobbing up and down outside , the face looking in at him , and swinging slowly from one side of the window to the other . Even in that dim light there could be no mistaking those features . Drawn , distorted and blood-stained , they were still those of the young fellow-squire who had sat so recently upon his own couch . With a cry of horror Alleyne sprang from his bed and rushed to the casement , while the two archers , aroused by the sound , seized their weapons and stared about them in bewilderment . One glance was enough to show Edricson that his fears were but too true . Foully murdered , with a score of wounds upon him and a rope round his neck , his poor friend had been cast from the upper window and swung slowly in the night wind , his body rasping against the wall and his disfigured face upon a level with the casement . `` My God ! '' cried Alleyne , shaking in every limb . `` What has come upon us ? What devil 's deed is this ? `` `` Here is flint and steel , '' said John stolidly . `` The lamp , Aylward ! This moonshine softens a man 's heart . Now we may use the eyes which God hath given us . `` `` By my hilt ! '' cried Aylward , as the yellow flame flickered up , `` it is indeed young master Ford , and I think that this seneschal is a black villain , who dare not face us in the day but would murther us in our sleep . By the twang of string ! if I do not soak a goose 's feather with his heart 's blood , it will be no fault of Samkin Aylward of the White Company . `` `` But , Aylward , think of the men whom I saw yesternight , '' said Alleyne . `` It may not be the seneschal . It may be that others have come into the castle . I must to Sir Nigel ere it be too late . Let me go , Aylward , for my place is by his side . `` `` One moment , mon gar . Put that steel head-piece on the end of my yew-stave . So ! I will put it first through the door ; for it is ill to come out when you can neither see nor guard yourself . Now , camarades , out swords and stand ready ! Hola , by my hilt ! it is time that we were stirring ! `` As he spoke , a sudden shouting broke forth in the castle , with the scream of a woman and the rush of many feet . Then came the sharp clink of clashing steel
