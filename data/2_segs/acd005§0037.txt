Then it was borne suddenly in upon her that her children as well as her lover were to be taken from her , that this other woman should see them and speak with them and win their love while she was far away . All that was evil and bitter in the woman flashed suddenly up in her , until for the instant she was what the king had thought her . If her son was not for her , then he should be for none . A jewelled knife lay among her treasures , ready to her hand . She caught it up and rushed at the cowering lad . Louis screamed and ran forward to stop her ; but another had been swifter than he . A woman had darted through the open door , and had caught the upraised wrist . There was a moment 's struggle , two queenly figures swayed and strained , and the knife dropped between their feet . The frightened Louis caught it up , and seizing his little son by the wrist , he rushed from the apartment . Francoise de Montespan staggered back against the ottoman to find herself confronted by the steady eyes and set face of that other Francoise , the woman whose presence fell like a shadow at every turn of her life . `` I have saved you , madame , from doing that which you would have been the first to bewail . `` `` Saved me ! It is you who have driven me to this ! `` The fallen favourite leaned against the high back of the ottoman , her hands resting behind her upon the curve of the velvet . Her lids were half closed on her flashing eyes , and her lips just parted to show a gleam of her white teeth . Here was the true Francoise de Montespan , a feline creature crouching for a spring , very far from that humble and soft-spoken Francoise who had won the king back by her gentle words . Madame de Maintenon 's hand had been cut in the struggle , and the blood was dripping down from the end of her fingers , but neither woman had time to spare a thought upon that . Her firm gray eyes were fixed upon her former rival as one fixes them upon some weak and treacherous creature who may be dominated by a stronger will . `` Yes , it is you who have driven me to this -- -you , whom I picked up when you were hard pressed for a crust of bread or a cup of sour wine . What had you ? You had nothing -- -nothing except a name which was a laughing-stock . And what did I give you ? I gave you everything . You know that I gave you everything . Money , position , the entrance to the court . You had them all from me . And now you mock me ! `` `` Madame , I do not mock you . I pity you from the bottom of my heart. '' '' Pity ? Ha ! ha ! A Mortemart is pitied by the widow Scarron ! Your pity may go where your gratitude is , and where your character is.We shall be troubled with it no longer then . `` `` Your words do not pain me . `` `` I can believe that you are not sensitive . `` `` Not when my conscience is at ease. '' '' Ah ! it has not troubled you , then ? `` `` Not upon this point , madame . `` `` My God ! How terrible must those other points have been ! `` `` I have never had an evil thought towards you . `` `` None towards me ? Oh , woman , woman ! `` `` What have I done , then ? The king came to my room to see the children taught . He stayed . He talked . He asked my opinion on this and that . Could I be silent ? or could I say other than what I thought ? `` `` You turned him against me ! `` `` I should be proud indeed if I thought that I had turned him to virtue . `` `` The word comes well from your lips . `` `` I would that I heard it upon yours . `` `` And so , by your own confession , you stole the king 's love from me , most virtuous of widows ! `` `` I had all gratitude and kindly thought for you . You have , as you have so often reminded me , been my benefactress . It was not necessary for you to say it , for I had never for an instant forgotten it . Yet if the king has asked me what I thought , I will not deny to you that I have said that sin is sin , and that he would be a worthier man if he shook off the guilty bonds which held him . `` `` Or exchanged them for others . `` `` For those of duty. '' '' Pah ! Your hypocrisy sickens me ! If you pretend to be a nun , why are you not where the nuns are ? You would have the best of two worlds -- - would you not ? -- -have all that the court can give , and yet ape the manners of the cloister . But you need not do it with me ! I know you as your inmost heart knows you . I was honest , and what I did , I did before the world . You , behind your priests and your directors and yourprie-dieusand your missals -- -do you think that you deceive me , as you deceive others ? `` Her antagonist 's gray eyes sparkled for the first time , and she took a quick step forward , with one white hand half lifted in rebuke . `` You may speak as you will of me , '' said she . `` To me it is no more than the foolish paroquet that chatters in your ante-room . But do not touch upon things which are sacred . Ah , if you would but raise your own thoughts to such things -- -if you would but turn them inwards , and see , before it is too late , how vile and foul is this life which you have led ! What might you not have done ? His soul was in your hands like clay for the potter . If you had raised him up , if you had led him on the higher path , if you had brought out all that was noble and good within him , how your name would have been loved and blessed , from the chateau to the cottage ! But no ; you dragged him down ; you wasted his youth ; you drew him from his wife ; you marred his manhood . A crime in one so high begets a thousand others in those who look to him for an example ; and all , all are upon your soul . Take heed , madame , for God 's sake take heed ere it be too late ! For all your beauty , there can be for you , as for me , a few short years of life . Then , when that brown hair is white , when that white cheek is sunken , when that bright eye is dimmed -- -ah , then God pity the sin-stained soul of Francoise de Montespan ! `` Her rival had sunk her head for the moment before the solemn words and the beautiful eyes . For an instant she stood silent , cowed for the first time in all her life ; but then the mocking , defiant spirit came back to her , and she glanced up with a curling lip . `` I am already provided with a spiritual director , thank you , '' said she . `` Oh , madame , you must not think to throw dust in my eyes ! I know you , and know you well ! `` `` On the contrary , you seem to know less than I had expected . If you know me so well , pray what am I ? `` All her rival 's bitterness and hatred rang in the tones of her answer . `` You are , '' said she , `` the governess of my children , and the secret mistress of the king . `` `` You are mistaken , '' answered Madame de Maintenon serenely . `` I am the governess of your children , and I am the king 's wife . `` Often had De Montespan feigned a faint in the days when she wished to disarm the anger of the king . So she had drawn his arms round her , and won the pity which is the twin sister of love . But now she knew what it was to have the senses struck out of her by a word . She could not doubt the truth of what she heard . There was that in her rival 's face , in her steady eye , in her quiet voice , which carried absolute conviction with it . She stood stunned for an instant , panting , her outstretched hands feeling at the air , her defiant eyes dulling and glazing . Then , with a short sharp cry , the wail of one who has fought hard and yet knows that she can fight no more , her proud head drooped , and she fell forward senseless at the feet of her rival . Madame de Maintenon stooped and raised her up in her strong white arms . There was true grief and pity in her eyes as she looked down at the snow-pale face which lay against her bosom , all the bitterness and pride gone out of it , and nothing left save the tear which sparkled under the dark lashes , and the petulant droop of the lip , like that of a child which had wept itself to sleep . She laid her on the ottoman and placed a silken cushion under her head . Then she gathered together and put back into the open cupboard all the jewels which were scattered about the carpet . Having locked it , and placed the key on the table where its owner 's eye would readily fall upon it , she struck a gong , which summoned the little black page . `` Your mistress is indisposed , '' said she . `` Go and bring her maids to her . '' And so , having done all that lay with her to do , she turned away from the great silent room , where , amid the velvet and the gilding , her beautiful rival lay like a crushed flower , helpless and hopeless.Helpless enough , for what could she do ? and hopeless too , for how could fortune aid her ? The instant that her senses had come back to her she had sent away her waiting women , and lay with clasped hands and a drawn face planning out her own weary future . She must go ; that was certain . Not merely because it was the king 's order , but because only misery and mockery remained for her now in the palace where she had reigned supreme . It was true that she had held her position against the queen before , but all her hatred could not blind her to the
