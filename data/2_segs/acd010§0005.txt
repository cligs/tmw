Celtic , I presume ? `` `` I am an Irishman , sir . `` `` Irish Irish ? `` `` Yes , sir . `` `` That , of course , explains it . Let me see ; you have given me your promise that my confidence will be respected ? That confidence , I may say , will be far from complete . But I am prepared to give you a few indications which will be of interest . In the first place , you are probably aware that two years ago I made a journey to South America -- -one which will be classical in the scientific history of the world ? The object of my journey was to verify some conclusions of Wallace and of Bates , which could only be done by observing their reported facts under the same conditions in which they had themselves noted them . If my expedition had no other results it would still have been noteworthy , but a curious incident occurred to me while there which opened up an entirely fresh line of inquiry . `` You are aware -- -or probably , in this half-educated age , you are not aware -- -that the country round some parts of the Amazon is still only partially explored , and that a great number of tributaries , some of them entirely uncharted , run into the main river . It was my business to visit this little-known back-country and to examine its fauna , which furnished me with the materials for several chapters for that great and monumental work upon zoology which will be my life 's justification . I was returning , my work accomplished , when I had occasion to spend a night at a small Indian village at a point where a certain tributary -- -the name and position of which I withhold -- -opens into the main river . The natives were Cucama Indians , an amiable but degraded race , with mental powers hardly superior to the average Londoner . I had effected some cures among them upon my way up the river , and had impressed them considerably with my personality , so that I was not surprised to find myself eagerly awaited upon my return . I gathered from their signs that someone had urgent need of my medical services , and I followed the chief to one of his huts . When I entered I found that the sufferer to whose aid I had been summoned had that instant expired . He was , to my surprise , no Indian , but a white man ; indeed , I may say a very white man , for he was flaxen-haired and had some characteristics of an albino . He was clad in rags , was very emaciated , and bore every trace of prolonged hardship . So far as I could understand the account of the natives , he was a complete stranger to them , and had come upon their village through the woods alone and in the last stage of exhaustion . `` The man 's knapsack lay beside the couch , and I examined the contents . His name was written upon a tab within it -- -Maple White , Lake Avenue , Detroit , Michigan . It is a name to which I am prepared always to lift my hat . It is not too much to say that it will rank level with my own when the final credit of this business comes to be apportioned . `` From the contents of the knapsack it was evident that this man had been an artist and poet in search of effects . There were scraps of verse . I do not profess to be a judge of such things , but they appeared to me to be singularly wanting in merit . There were also some rather commonplace pictures of river scenery , a paint-box , a box of colored chalks , some brushes , that curved bone which lies upon my inkstand , a volume of Baxter 's 'Moths and Butterflies , ' a cheap revolver , and a few cartridges . Of personal equipment he either had none or he had lost it in his journey . Such were the total effects of this strange American Bohemian . `` I was turning away from him when I observed that something projected from the front of his ragged jacket . It was this sketch-book , which was as dilapidated then as you see it now . Indeed , I can assure you that a first folio of Shakespeare could not be treated with greater reverence than this relic has been since it came into my possession . I hand it to you now , and I ask you to take it page by page and to examine the contents . `` He helped himself to a cigar and leaned back with a fiercely critical pair of eyes , taking note of the effect which this document would produce.I had opened the volume with some expectation of a revelation , though of what nature I could not imagine . The first page was disappointing , however , as it contained nothing but the picture of a very fat man in a pea-jacket , with the legend , `` Jimmy Colver on the Mail-boat , '' written beneath it . There followed several pages which were filled with small sketches of Indians and their ways . Then came a picture of a cheerful and corpulent ecclesiastic in a shovel hat , sitting opposite a very thin European , and the inscription : `` Lunch with Fra Cristofero at Rosario . '' Studies of women and babies accounted for several more pages , and then there was an unbroken series of animal drawings with such explanations as `` Manatee upon Sandbank , '' `` Turtles and Their Eggs , '' `` Black Ajouti under a Miriti Palm '' -- -the matter disclosing some sort of pig-like animal ; and finally came a double page of studies of long-snouted and very unpleasant saurians . I could make nothing of it , and said so to the Professor . `` Surely these are only crocodiles ? '' '' Alligators ! Alligators ! There is hardly such a thing as a true crocodile in South America . The distinction between them -- -- -- '' '' I meant that I could see nothing unusual -- -nothing to justify what you have said . `` He smiled serenely . `` Try the next page , '' said he.I was still unable to sympathize . It was a full-page sketch of a landscape roughly tinted in color -- -the kind of painting which an open-air artist takes as a guide to a future more elaborate effort . There was a pale-green foreground of feathery vegetation , which sloped upwards and ended in a line of cliffs dark red in color , and curiously ribbed like some basaltic formations which I have seen . They extended in an unbroken wall right across the background . At one point was an isolated pyramidal rock , crowned by a great tree , which appeared to be separated by a cleft from the main crag . Behind it all , a blue tropical sky . A thin green line of vegetation fringed the summit of the ruddy cliff. '' Well ? '' he asked . `` It is no doubt a curious formation , '' said I `` but I am not geologist enough to say that it is wonderful. '' '' Wonderful ! '' he repeated . `` It is unique . It is incredible . No one on earth has ever dreamed of such a possibility . Now the next . `` I turned it over , and gave an exclamation of surprise . There was a full-page picture of the most extraordinary creature that I had ever seen . It was the wild dream of an opium smoker , a vision of delirium . The head was like that of a fowl , the body that of a bloated lizard , the trailing tail was furnished with upward-turned spikes , and the curved back was edged with a high serrated fringe , which looked like a dozen cocks ' wattles placed behind each other . In front of this creature was an absurd mannikin , or dwarf , in human form , who stood staring at it . `` Well , what do you think of that ? '' cried the Professor , rubbing his hands with an air of triumph . `` It is monstrous -- -grotesque . `` `` But what made him draw such an animal ? `` `` Trade gin , I should think . `` `` Oh , that 's the best explanation you can give , is it ? `` `` Well , sir , what is yours ? `` `` The obvious one that the creature exists . That is actually sketched from the life . `` I should have laughed only that I had a vision of our doing another Catharine-wheel down the passage . `` No doubt , '' said I , `` no doubt , '' as one humors an imbecile . `` I confess , however , '' I added , `` that this tiny human figure puzzles me . If it were an Indian we could set it down as evidence of some pigmy race in America , but it appears to be a European in a sun-hat . `` The Professor snorted like an angry buffalo . `` You really touch the limit , '' said he . `` You enlarge my view of the possible . Cerebral paresis ! Mental inertia ! Wonderful ! `` He was too absurd to make me angry . Indeed , it was a waste of energy , for if you were going to be angry with this man you would be angry all the time . I contented myself with smiling wearily . `` It struck me that the man was small , '' said I . `` Look here ! '' he cried , leaning forward and dabbing a great hairy sausage of a finger on to the picture . `` You see that plant behind the animal ; I suppose you thought it was a dandelion or a Brussels sprout -- -what ? Well , it is a vegetable ivory palm , and they run to about fifty or sixty feet . Do n't you see that the man is put in for a purpose ? He could n't really have stood in front of that brute and lived to draw it . He sketched himself in to give a scale of heights . He was , we will say , over five feet high . The tree is ten times bigger , which is what one would expect . `` `` Good heavens ! '' I cried . `` Then you think the beast was -- -- -- Why , Charing Cross station would hardly make a kennel for such a brute ! `` `` Apart from exaggeration , he is certainly a well-grown specimen , '' said the Professor , complacently . `` But , '' I cried , `` surely the whole experience of the human race is not to be set aside on account of a single sketch '' -- -I had turned over the leaves and ascertained that there was nothing more in the book -- - '' a single sketch by a wandering American artist who may have done it under hashish , or in the delirium of fever , or simply in order to gratify a freakish imagination . You ca n't , as a man of science , defend such a position as that . ``
