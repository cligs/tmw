thought he would be safer on the moor than anywhere else until the hue and cry was over , so he lay in hiding there . But every second night we made sure if he was still there by putting a light in the window , and if there was an answer my husband took out some bread and meat to him . Every day we hoped that he was gone , but as long as he was there we could not desert him . That is the whole truth , as I am an honest Christian woman and you will see that if there is blame in the matter it does not lie with my husband but with me , for whose sake he has done all that he has . `` The woman 's words came with an intense earnestness which carried conviction with them . `` Is this true , Barrymore ? `` `` Yes , Sir Henry . Every word of it . `` `` Well , I can not blame you for standing by your own wife . Forget what I have said . Go to your room , you two , and we shall talk further about this matter in the morning . `` When they were gone we looked out of the window again . Sir Henry had flung it open , and the cold night wind beat in upon our faces . Far away in the black distance there still glowed that one tiny point of yellow light . `` I wonder he dares , '' said Sir Henry . `` It may be so placed as to be only visible from here . `` `` Very likely . How far do you think it is ? `` `` Out by the Cleft Tor , I think . `` `` Not more than a mile or two off . `` `` Hardly that . `` `` Well , it can not be far if Barrymore had to carry out the food to it . And he is waiting , this villain , beside that candle . By thunder , Watson , I am going out to take that man ! `` The same thought had crossed my own mind . It was not as if the Barrymores had taken us into their confidence . Their secret had been forced from them . The man was a danger to the community , an unmitigated scoundrel for whom there was neither pity nor excuse . We were only doing our duty in taking this chance of putting him back where he could do no harm . With his brutal and violent nature , others would have to pay the price if we held our hands . Any night , for example , our neighbours the Stapletons might be attacked by him , and it may have been the thought of this which made Sir Henry so keen upon the adventure . `` I will come , '' said I . `` Then get your revolver and put on your boots . The sooner we start the better , as the fellow may put out his light and be off . `` In five minutes we were outside the door , starting upon our expedition . We hurried through the dark shrubbery , amid the dull moaning of the autumn wind and the rustle of the falling leaves . The night air was heavy with the smell of damp and decay . Now and again the moon peeped out for an instant , but clouds were driving over the face of the sky , and just as we came out on the moor a thin rain began to fall . The light still burned steadily in front . `` Are you armed ? '' I asked . `` I have a hunting-crop . `` `` We must close in on him rapidly , for he is said to be a desperate fellow . We shall take him by surprise and have him at our mercy before he can resist . `` `` I say , Watson , '' said the baronet , `` what would Holmes say to this ? How about that hour of darkness in which the power of evil is exalted ? `` As if in answer to his words there rose suddenly out of the vast gloom of the moor that strange cry which I had already heard upon the borders of the great Grimpen Mire . It came with the wind through the silence of the night , a long , deep mutter , then a rising howl , and then the sad moan in which it died away . Again and again it sounded , the whole air throbbing with it , strident , wild , and menacing . The baronet caught my sleeve and his face glimmered white through the darkness . `` My God , what 's that , Watson ? `` `` I do n't know . It 's a sound they have on the moor . I heard it once before . `` It died away , and an absolute silence closed in upon us . We stood straining our ears , but nothing came . `` Watson , '' said the baronet , `` it was the cry of a hound . `` My blood ran cold in my veins , for there was a break in his voice which told of the sudden horror which had seized him . `` What do they call this sound ? '' he asked. '' Who ? `` `` The folk on the countryside . `` `` Oh , they are ignorant people . Why should you mind what they call it ? `` `` Tell me , Watson . What do they say of it ? `` I hesitated but could not escape the question . `` They say it is the cry of the Hound of the Baskervilles . `` He groaned and was silent for a few moments . `` A hound it was , '' he said at last , `` but it seemed to come from miles away , over yonder , I think . `` `` It was hard to say whence it came . `` `` It rose and fell with the wind . Is n't that the direction of the great Grimpen Mire ? `` `` Yes , it is . `` `` Well , it was up there . Come now , Watson , did n't you think yourself that it was the cry of a hound ? I am not a child . You need not fear to speak the truth . `` `` Stapleton was with me when I heard it last . He said that it might be the calling of a strange bird . `` `` No , no , it was a hound . My God , can there be some truth in all these stories ? Is it possible that I am really in danger from so dark a cause ? You do n't believe it , do you , Watson ? `` `` No , no . `` `` And yet it was one thing to laugh about it in London , and it is another to stand out here in the darkness of the moor and to hear such a cry as that . And my uncle ! There was the footprint of the hound beside him as he lay . It all fits together . I do n't think that I am a coward , Watson , but that sound seemed to freeze my very blood . Feel my hand ! `` It was as cold as a block of marble . `` You 'll be all right tomorrow . `` `` I do n't think I 'll get that cry out of my head . What do you advise that we do now ? `` `` Shall we turn back ? `` `` No , by thunder ; we have come out to get our man , and we will do it . We after the convict , and a hell-hound , as likely as not , after us . Come on ! We 'll see it through if all the fiends of the pit were loose upon the moor . `` We stumbled slowly along in the darkness , with the black loom of the craggy hills around us , and the yellow speck of light burning steadily in front . There is nothing so deceptive as the distance of a light upon a pitch-dark night , and sometimes the glimmer seemed to be far away upon the horizon and sometimes it might have been within a few yards of us . But at last we could see whence it came , and then we knew that we were indeed very close . A guttering candle was stuck in a crevice of the rocks which flanked it on each side so as to keep the wind from it and also to prevent it from being visible , save in the direction of Baskerville Hall . A boulder of granite concealed our approach , and crouching behind it we gazed over it at the signal light . It was strange to see this single candle burning there in the middle of the moor , with no sign of life near it -- -just the one straight yellow flame and the gleam of the rock on each side of it . `` What shall we do now ? '' whispered Sir Henry . `` Wait here . He must be near his light . Let us see if we can get a glimpse of him . `` The words were hardly out of my mouth when we both saw him . Over the rocks , in the crevice of which the candle burned , there was thrust out an evil yellow face , a terrible animal face , all seamed and scored with vile passions . Foul with mire , with a bristling beard , and hung with matted hair , it might well have belonged to one of those old savages who dwelt in the burrows on the hillsides . The light beneath him was reflected in his small , cunning eyes which peered fiercely to right and left through the darkness like a crafty and savage animal who has heard the steps of the hunters.Something had evidently aroused his suspicions . It may have been that Barrymore had some private signal which we had neglected to give , or the fellow may have had some other reason for thinking that all was not well , but I could read his fears upon his wicked face . Any instant he might dash out the light and vanish in the darkness . I sprang forward therefore , and Sir Henry did the same . At the same moment the convict screamed out a curse at us and hurled a rock which splintered up against the boulder which had sheltered us . I caught one glimpse of his short , squat , strongly built figure as he sprang to his feet and turned to run . At the same moment by a lucky chance the moon broke through the clouds . We rushed over the brow of the hill , and there was our man running with great speed down the other side , springing over the stones in his way with the activity of a mountain goat . A lucky long shot of my revolver might have crippled him , but I had brought it only to defend myself if attacked and not to shoot an unarmed man who was running away.We were both swift runners and in fairly good training , but we soon found that we had no chance of overtaking him . We saw him for
