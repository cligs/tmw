own business . I did n't mind what he said though , as long as I had the cat . `` `` Spoke like that , did he ? '' said Tom savagely , flushing up to his eyes . `` I wish I saw him now . I 'd teach him manners , or -- - '' '' You 'll certainly get run over if you go on like that , '' interruptedKate.Indeed , the young man in his indignation was striding over a crossing without the slightest heed of the imminent danger which he ran from the stream of traffic . `` Do n't be so excitable , Cousin Tom , '' she said , laying her gloved hand upon his arm ; `` there is nothing to be cross about . `` `` Is n't there ? '' he answered furiously . `` It 's a pretty state of things that you should have to submit to insults from a brutal puppy like that fellow Ezra Girdlestone . '' The pair had managed by this time to get half-way across the broad road , and were halting upon the little island of safety formed by the great stone base of a lamp-post . An interminable stream of 'buses -- -yellow , purple , and brown -- -with vans , hansoms , and growlers , blocked the way in front of them . A single policeman , with his back turned to them , and his two arms going like an animated semaphore , was the only human being in their immediate vicinity . Amid all the roar and rattle of the huge city they were as thoroughly left to themselves as though they were in the centre of Salisbury Plain . `` You must have a protector , '' Tom said with decision . `` Oh , Cousin Tom , do n't be foolish ; I can protect myself very well . `` `` You must have some one who has a right to look after you . '' The young man 's voice was husky , for the back part of his throat had become unaccountably dry of a sudden . `` You can pass now , sir , '' roared the constable , for there was a momentary break in the traffic . `` Do n't go for a moment , '' Tom cried , desperately detaining his companion by the sleeve of her jacket . `` We are alone here and can talk . Do n't you think -- -do n't you think you could like me a little bit if you were to try ? I love you so , Kate , that I can not help hoping that my love is not all lost . `` `` All clear now , sir , '' shouted the constable once more . `` Do n't mind him , '' said Tom , still detaining her on the little-island . `` Since I met you in Edinburgh , Kate , I have seemed to be walking in a dream . Do what I will , go where I will , I still have you before my eyes and hear your sweet voice in my ears . I do n't believe any girl was ever loved more dearly than I love you , but I find it so hard to put into words the thoughts that I have in my mind . For Heaven 's sake , give me some little gleam of hope to carry away with me . You do n't dislike me , Kate , do you ? `` `` You know that I do n't , Cousin Tom , '' said the young lady , with downcast eyes . He had cornered her so skilfully against the great lamp that she could move neither to the right nor to the left . `` Do you like me , then , Kate ? '' he asked eagerly , with a loving light in his earnest grey eyes . `` Of course I do . `` `` Do you think you could love me ? '' continued this persistent young man . `` I do n't mean all at once , and in a moment , because I know very well that I am not worthy of it . But in time do n't you think you could come to love me ? `` `` Perhaps , '' murmured Kate , with averted face . It was such a very little murmur that it was wonderful that it should be audible at all ; yet it pealed in the young man 's ears above the rattle and the clatter of the busy street . His head was very near to hers at the time . `` Now 's your time , sir , '' roared the semaphoric policeman.Had Tom been in a less exposed position it is possible that he might have acted upon that well-timed remark from the cunning constable . The centre of a London crossing is not , however , a very advantageous spot for the performance of love passages . As they walked on , threading their way among the vehicles , Tom took his companion 's hand in his , and they exchanged one firm grip , which each felt to be of the nature of a pledge . How sunny and bright the dull brick-lined streets appeared to those two young people that afternoon . They were both looking into a future which seemed to be one long vista of happiness and love . Of all the gifts of Providence , surely our want of knowledge of the things which are to come upon us is the most merciful , and the one we could least dispense with ! So happy and so light-hearted were these two lovers that it was not until they found themselves in Warwick Street once more that they came down from the clouds , and realized that there were some commonplace details which must be dealt with in one way or another . `` Of course , I may tell my own people , dearest , about our engagement ? `` Tom said . `` I wonder what your mother will say ? '' answered Kate , laughing merrily . `` She will be awfully astonished . `` `` How about Girdlestone ? '' asked Tom.The thought of the guardian had never occurred to either of them before . They stared at each other , and Kate 's face assumed such an expression of dismay that her companion burst out laughing . `` Do n't be frightened , darling , '' he said . `` If you like , I 'll go in and 'beard the lion in his den . ' There is no time like the present . `` `` No , no , dear Tom , '' she cried eagerly . `` You must not do that . '' It was impossible for her to tell him how especially Girdlestone had cautioned her against him , but she felt that it would never do to allow the two to meet . `` We must conceal our engagement from Mr . Girdlestone . `` `` Conceal our engagement ! `` `` Yes , Tom . He has warned me so often against anything of the sort , that really I do n't know what he would do if he knew about it . He would certainly make it very uncomfortable for me to live with him . Remember I am nearly twenty now , so in a little more than a year I shall be entirely free . That is not very long . `` `` I do n't know about that , '' Tom said doubtfully . `` However , if you will be more comfortable , of course that settles the question . It seems rather hard , though , that we should have to conceal it , simply in order to pacify this old bear . `` `` It 's only for a time , Tom ; and you may tell them at home by all means . Now , good-bye , dear ; they will see you from the windows if you come nearer . `` `` Good-bye , my darling . `` They shook hands and parted , he hurrying away with the glad tidings to Phillimore Gardens , she tripping back to her captivity with the lightest heart that she had felt for a weary time . Passers-by glanced back at the bright little face under the bright little bonnet , and Ezra Girdlestone , looking down at her from the drawing-room window , bethought him that if the diamond speculation should fail it would be no hardship to turn to his father 's word.The revelation of the real state of the firm 's finances was a terrible blow to Ezra Girdlestone . To a man of his overbearing , tempestuous disposition failure and poverty were bitter things to face . He had been wont to tread down before him all such little difficulties and obstacles as came across him in his former life . Now he encountered a great barrier which could not be passed so easily , and he raged and chafed before it . It made him still more wroth to think that the fault was none of his . All his life he had reckoned , as a matter of course , that when his father passed away he would be left almost a millionaire . A single half-hour 's conversation had shattered this delusion and left him face to face with ruin . He lost his sleep and became restless and hollow-eyed . Once or twice he was seen the worse for drink in the daytime.He was a man of strong character , however , and though somewhat demoralized by the sudden shock , he threw away no point in the game which he and his father were playing . He saw clearly that only a bold stroke could save them . He therefore threw himself heart and soul into the diamond scheme , and worked out the details in a masterly manner . The more he looked into it the more convinced he became , not only of its feasibility , but of its absolute safety . It seemed as though it were hardly possible that it should fail.Among other things he proceeded to qualify himself as a dealer in diamonds . It happened that he was acquainted with one of the partners of the firm of Fugger & Stoltz , who did the largest import trade in precious stones . Through his kindness he received practical instructions in the variety and value of diamonds , and learned to detect all those little flaws and peculiarities which are only visible to the eye of an expert , and yet are of the highest importance in determinating the price of a stone . With such opportunities Ezra made rapid progress , and within a few weeks there were not many dealers in the trade who had a better grasp of the subject.Both the Girdlestones recognized that the success of their plan depended very largely upon their choice of an agent , and both were of the opinion that in Major Tobias Clutterbuck they had just the man that they were in want of . The younger merchant had long felt vaguely that the major 's social position , combined with his impecuniosity and the looseness of his morality , as inferred from his mode of life , might some day make him a valuable agent under delicate circumstances . As to the old soldier 's own inclinations , Ezra flattered himself that he knew the man 's nature to a nicety . It was simply a question of the price to be paid . No doubt the figure would be
