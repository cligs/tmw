it if you will but come with me to France . `` `` Nay , '' said Alleyne , `` I would gladly come with ye to France or where else ye will , just to list to your talk , and because ye are the only two friends that I have in the whole wide world outside of the cloisters ; but , indeed , it may not be , for my duty is towards my brother , seeing that father and mother are dead , and he my elder . Besides , when ye talk of taking me to France , ye do not conceive how useless I should be to you , seeing that neither by training nor by nature am I fitted for the wars , and there seems to be nought but strife in those parts . `` `` That comes from my fool 's talk , '' cried the archer ; `` for being a man of no learning myself , my tongue turns to blades and targets , even as my hand does . Know then that for every parchment in England there are twenty in France . For every statue , cut gem , shrine , carven screen , or what else might please the eye of a learned clerk , there are a good hundred to our one . At the spoiling of Carcasonne I have seen chambers stored with writing , though not one man in our Company could read them . Again , in Arles and Nimes , and other towns that I could name , there are the great arches and fortalices still standing which were built of old by giant men who came from the south . Can I not see by your brightened eye how you would love to look upon these things ? Come then with me , and , by these ten finger-bones ! there is not one of them which you shall not see . `` `` I should indeed love to look upon them , '' Alleyne answered ; `` but I have come from Beaulieu for a purpose , and I must be true to my service , even as thou art true to thine . `` `` Bethink you again , mon ami , '' quoth Aylward , `` that you might do much good yonder , since there are three hundred men in the Company , and none who has ever a word of grace for them , and yet the Virgin knows that there was never a set of men who were in more need of it . Sickerly the one duty may balance the other . Your brother hath done without you this many a year , and , as I gather , he hath never walked as far as Beaulieu to see you during all that time , so he can not be in any great need of you . `` `` Besides , '' said John , `` the Socman of Minstead is a by-word through the forest , from Bramshaw Hill to Holmesley Walk . He is a drunken , brawling , perilous churl , as you may find to your cost . `` `` The more reason that I should strive to mend him , '' quoth Alleyne . `` There is no need to urge me , friends , for my own wishes would draw me to France , and it would be a joy to me if I could go with you . But indeed and indeed it can not be , so here I take my leave of you , for yonder square tower amongst the trees upon the right must surely be the church of Minstead , and I may reach it by this path through the woods . `` `` Well , God be with thee , lad ! '' cried the archer , pressing Alleyne to his heart . `` I am quick to love , and quick to hate and 'fore God I am loth to part . `` `` Would it not be well , '' said John , `` that we should wait here , and see what manner of greeting you have from your brother . You may prove to be as welcome as the king 's purveyor to the village dame . `` `` Nay , nay , '' he answered ; `` ye must not bide for me , for where I go I stay . `` `` Yet it may be as well that you should know whither we go , '' said the archer . `` We shall now journey south through the woods until we come out upon the Christchurch road , and so onwards , hoping to-night to reach the castle of Sir William Montacute , Earl of Salisbury , of which Sir Nigel Loring is constable . There we shall bide , and it is like enough that for a month or more you may find us there , ere we are ready for our viage back to France . `` It was hard indeed for Alleyne to break away from these two new but hearty friends , and so strong was the combat between his conscience and his inclinations that he dared not look round , lest his resolution should slip away from him . It was not until he was deep among the tree trunks that he cast a glance backwards , when he found that he could still see them through the branches on the road above him . The archer was standing with folded arms , his bow jutting from over his shoulder , and the sun gleaming brightly upon his head-piece and the links of his chain-mail . Beside him stood his giant recruit , still clad in the home-spun and ill-fitting garments of the fuller of Lymington , with arms and legs shooting out of his scanty garb . Even as Alleyne watched them they turned upon their heels and plodded off together upon their way.The path which the young clerk had now to follow lay through a magnificent forest of the very heaviest timber , where the giant bowls of oak and of beech formed long aisles in every direction , shooting up their huge branches to build the majestic arches of Nature 's own cathedral . Beneath lay a broad carpet of the softest and greenest moss , flecked over with fallen leaves , but yielding pleasantly to the foot of the traveller . The track which guided him was one so seldom used that in places it lost itself entirely among the grass , to reappear as a reddish rut between the distant tree trunks . It was very still here in the heart of the woodlands . The gentle rustle of the branches and the distant cooing of pigeons were the only sounds which broke in upon the silence , save that once Alleyne heard afar off a merry call upon a hunting bugle and the shrill yapping of the hounds.It was not without some emotion that he looked upon the scene around him , for , in spite of his secluded life , he knew enough of the ancient greatness of his own family to be aware that the time had been when they had held undisputed and paramount sway over all that tract of country . His father could trace his pure Saxon lineage back to that Godfrey Malf who had held the manors of Bisterne and of Minstead at the time when the Norman first set mailed foot upon English soil . The afforestation of the district , however , and its conversion into a royal demesne had clipped off a large section of his estate , while other parts had been confiscated as a punishment for his supposed complicity in an abortive Saxon rising . The fate of the ancestor had been typical of that of his descendants . During three hundred years their domains had gradually contracted , sometimes through royal or feudal encroachment , and sometimes through such gifts to the Church as that with which Alleyne 's father had opened the doors of Beaulieu Abbey to his younger son . The importance of the family had thus dwindled , but they still retained the old Saxon manor-house , with a couple of farms and a grove large enough to afford pannage to a hundred pigs -- - '' sylva de centum porcis , '' as the old family parchments describe it . Above all , the owner of the soil could still hold his head high as the veritable Socman of Minstead -- -that is , as holding the land in free socage , with no feudal superior , and answerable to no man lower than the king . Knowing this , Alleyne felt some little glow of worldly pride as he looked for the first time upon the land with which so many generations of his ancestors had been associated . He pushed on the quicker , twirling his staff merrily , and looking out at every turn of the path for some sign of the old Saxon residence . He was suddenly arrested , however , by the appearance of a wild-looking fellow armed with a club , who sprang out from behind a tree and barred his passage . He was a rough , powerful peasant , with cap and tunic of untanned sheepskin , leather breeches , and galligaskins round legs and feet. '' Stand ! '' he shouted , raising his heavy cudgel to enforce the order . `` Who are you who walk so freely through the wood ? Whither would you go , and what is your errand ? `` `` Why should I answer your questions , my friend ? '' said Alleyne , standing on his guard . `` Because your tongue may save your pate . But where have I looked upon your face before ? `` `` No longer ago than last night at the 'Pied Merlin , ' '' the clerk answered , recognizing the escaped serf who had been so outspoken as to his wrongs . `` By the Virgin ! yes . You were the little clerk who sat so mum in the corner , and then cried fy on the gleeman . What hast in the scrip ? `` `` Naught of any price . `` `` How can I tell that , clerk ? Let me see . `` `` Not I. '' '' Fool ! I could pull you limb from limb like a pullet . What would you have ? Hast forgot that we are alone far from all men ? How can your clerkship help you ? Wouldst lose scrip and life too ? `` `` I will part with neither without fight . `` `` A fight , quotha ? A fight betwixt spurred cock and new hatched chicken ! Thy fighting days may soon be over . `` `` Hadst asked me in the name of charity I would have given freely , '' cried Alleyne . `` As it stands , not one farthing shall you have with my free will , and when I see my brother , the Socman of Minstead , he will raise hue and cry from vill to vill , from hundred to hundred , until you are taken as a common robber and a scourge to the country . `` The outlaw sank his club . `` The Socman 's brother ! '' he gasped . `` Now , by the keys of Peter ! I had rather that hand withered and tongue was palsied ere I had struck or miscalled you . If you are the Socman 's brother you are one of the right side , I warrant , for all your clerkly dress . `` `` His brother
