come of it , Matilda ! '' a prayer which his good wife echoed with all the strength of her kindly nature.It was already dusk when John Girdlestone and his ward reached Waterloo Station . He gave orders to the guard that the luggage should be stamped , but took care that she should not hear the name of their destination . Hurrying her rapidly down the platform amid the confused heaps of luggage and currents of eager passengers , he pushed her into a first-class carriage , and sprang after her just as the bell rang and the wheels began to revolve.They were alone . Kate crouched up into the corner among the cushions , and wrapped her rug round her , for it was bitterly cold . The merchant pulled a note-book from his pocket and proceeded by the light of the lamp above him to add up columns of figures . He sat very upright in his seat , and appeared to be as absorbed in his work as though he were among his papers in Fenchurch Street . He neither glanced at his companion nor made any inquiry as to her comfort.As she sat opposite to him she could not keep her eyes from his hard angular face , every rugged feature of which was exaggerated by the flickering yellow light above him . Those deep-set eyes and sunken cheeks had been familiar to her for years . How was it that they now , for the first time , struck her as being terrible ? Was it that new expression which had appeared upon them , that hard inexorable set about the mouth , which gave a more sinister character to his whole face ? As she gazed at him an ineffable loathing and dread rose in her soul , and she could have shrieked out of pure terror . She put her hand up to her throat with a gasp to keep down the sudden inclination to cry out . As she did so her guardian glanced over the top of the note-book with his piercing light grey eyes . `` Do n't get hysterical ! '' he cried . `` You have given us trouble enough without that . `` `` Oh , why are you so harsh ? '' she cried , throwing out her arms towards him in eloquent entreaty , while the tears coursed down her cheeks . `` What have I done that is so dreadful ? Icouldnot love your son , and I do love another . I am so grieved to have offended you . You used to be kind and like a father to me . `` `` And a nice return you have made me ! 'Honour your father , ' says the good old Book . What honour did you give me save to disobey every command which I have ever given you . I have to blame myself to some extent for having allowed you to go on that most pernicious trip to Scotland , where you were thrown into the company of this young adventurer by his scheming old fool of a father . `` It would have been a study for a Rembrandt to depict the craggy , strongly lined face of the old merchant , and the beautiful pleading one which looked across at him , with the light throwing strange shadows over both . As he spoke she brushed the tears from her eyes and an angry flush sprang to her cheeks . `` You may say what you like of me , '' she said bitterly . `` I suppose that is one of your privileges as my guardian . You have no right , however , to speak evil of my friends . 'He who calleth his brother a fool , ' I think the good old Book says something of that . `` Girdlestone was staggered for a moment by this unexpected counter . Then he took off his broad-brimmed hat and bowed his head with drooping lids . `` Out of the mouths of babes and of sucklings ! '' he cried . `` You are right . I spoke too warmly . It is my zeal for you which betrays me . `` `` The same zeal which made you tell me so many things which I now know to be untrue about Mr. Dimsdale , '' said Kate , waxing more fearless as her mind turned to her wrongs . `` You are becoming impertinent , '' he answered , and resumed his calculations in his note-book.Kate cowered back into her corner again , while the train thundered and screeched and rattled through the darkness . Looking through the steamy window , nothing was to be seen save the twinkle here and there of the lights of the scattered country cottages . Occasionally a red signal lamp would glare down upon her like the bloodshot eye of some demon who presided over this kingdom of iron and steam . Far behind a lurid trail of smoke marked the way that they had come . To Kate 's mind it was all as weird and gloomy and cheerless even as the thoughts within her.And they were gloomy enough . Where was she going ? How long was she going for ? What was she to do when there ? On all these points she was absolutely ignorant . What was the object of this sudden flight from London ? Her guardian could have separated her from the Dimsdales in many less elaborate ways than this . Could it be that he intended some system of pressure and terrorism by which she should be forced to accept Ezra as a suitor . She clenched her little white teeth as she thought of it , and registered a vow that nothing in this world would ever bring her to give in upon that point . There was only one bright spot in her outlook . When she reached her destination she would at once write to Mrs. Dimsdale , tell her where she was , and ask her frankly for an explanation of their sudden silence . How much wiser if she had done so before . Only a foolish pride had withheld her from it.The train had already stopped at one large junction . Looking out through the window she saw by the lamps that it was Guildford . After another interminable interval of clattering and tossing and plunging through the darkness , they came to a second station of importance , Petersfield . `` We are nearing our destination , '' Girdlestone remarked , shutting up his book.This proved to be a small wayside station , illuminated by a single lamp , which gave no information as to the name . They were the only passengers who alighted , and the train rolled on for Portsmouth , leaving them with their trunks upon the dark and narrow platform . It was a black night with a bitter wind which carried with it a suspicion of dampness , which might have been rain , or might have been the drift of the neighbouring ocean . Kate was numb with the cold , and even her gaunt companion stamped his feet and shivered as he looked about him . `` I telegraphed for a trap , '' said he to the guard . `` Is there not one waiting ? `` `` Yes , sir ; if you be Mister Girdlestone , there 's a trap from the *Flyin'Bull* . Here , Carker , here 's your gentleman . `` At this summons a rough-looking ostler emerged into the circle of light thrown by the single lamp and , touching his hat , announced in a surly voice that he was the individual In question . The guard and he then proceeded to drag the trunks to the vehicle . It was a small wagonette , with a high seat for the driver in front . `` Where to , sir ? '' asked the driver , when the travellers had taken their seats . `` To Hampton Priory . Do you know where that is ? `` `` Better'n two mile from here , and close to the railway line , '' said the man . `` There hai n't been no one livin ' there for two year at the least . `` `` We are expected and all will be ready for us , '' said Girdlestone . `` Go as fast as you can , for we are cold . `` The driver cracked his whip , and the horse started at a brisk trot down the dark country road.Looking round her , Kate saw that they were passing through a large country village , consisting of a broad main street , with a few insignificant offshoots branching away on either side . A church stood on one side , and on the other the village inn . The door was open and the light shining through the red curtains of the bar parlour looked warm and cosy . The clink of glasses and the murmur of cheerful voices sounded from within . Kate , as she looked across , felt doubly cheerless and lonely by the contrast . Girdlestone looked too , but with different emotions . `` Another plague spot , '' he cried , jerking his head in that direction . `` In town or country it is the same . These poison-sellers are scattered over the whole face of the land , and every one of them is a focus of disease and misery . `` `` Beg your pardon , sir , '' the surly driver observed , screwing round in his seat . `` That 'ere 's theFlyin ' Bull , sir , where I be in sarvice , and it ai n't no poison-seller , but a real right down good house . `` `` All liquor is poison , and every house devoted to the sale of it is a sinful house , '' Girdlestone said curtly . `` Do n't you say that to my maister , '' remarked the driver . `` He be a big man wi ' a ter'bly bad temper and a hand like a leg o ' mutton . Hold up , will ye ! `` The last remark was addressed to the horse , which had stumbled in going down a sharp incline . They were out of the village by this time , and the road was lined on either side by high hedges , which threw a dense shadow over everything . The feeble lamps of the wagonette bored two little yellow tunnels of light on either side . The man let the reins lie loose upon the horse 's back , and the animal picked out the roadway for itself . As they swung round from the narrow lane on to a broader road Kate broke out into a little cry of pleasure . `` There 's the sea ! '' she exclaimed joyfully . The moon had broken from behind the clouds and glittered on the vast silvery expanse . `` Yes , that 's the sea , '' the driver said , `` and them lights down yonder is at Lea Claxton , where the fisher-folk live ; and over there , '' pointing with his whip to a long dark shadow on the waters , `` is the Oilywoite . `` `` The what ? `` `` The Isle of Wight , he means , '' said Girdlestone . The driver looked at him reproachfully . `` Of course , '' said he , `` if you Lunnon folks knows more about it than we who are born an ' bred in the place , it 's no manner o '
