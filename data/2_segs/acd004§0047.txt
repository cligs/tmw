, '' said Ford , turning to Alleyne . `` How are we to take this , sir ? '' asked the ruffling squire . `` You may take it as it comes , '' said Ford carelessly . `` Here is pertness ! '' cried the other . `` Sir , I honor your truthfulness , '' said Ford . `` Stint it , Humphrey , '' said the tall squire , with a burst of laughter . `` You will have little credit from this gentleman , I perceive . Tongues are sharp in Hampshire , sir . `` `` And swords ? '' '' Hum ! we may prove that . In two days ' time is the vepres du tournoi , when we may see if your lance is as quick as your wit . `` `` All very well , Roger Harcomb , '' cried a burly , bull-necked young man , whose square shoulders and massive limbs told of exceptional personal strength . `` You pass too lightly over the matter . We are not to be so easily overcrowed . The Lord Loring hath given his proofs ; but we know nothing of his squires , save that one of them hath a railing tongue . And how of you , young sir ? '' bringing his heavy hand down on Alleyne 's shoulder . `` And what of me , young sir ? `` `` Ma foi ! this is my lady 's page come over . Your cheek will be browner and your hand harder ere you see your mother again . `` `` If my hand is not hard , it is ready. '' '' Ready ? Ready for what ? For the hem of my lady 's train ? `` `` Ready to chastise insolence , sir , '' cried Alleyne with flashing eyes . `` Sweet little coz ! '' answered the burly squire . `` Such a dainty color ! Such a mellow voice ! Eyes of a bashful maid , and hair like a three years ' babe ! Voila ! '' He passed his thick fingers roughly through the youth 's crisp golden curls . `` You seek to force a quarrel , sir , '' said the young man , white with anger . `` And what then ? `` `` Why , you do it like a country boor , and not like a gentle squire . Hast been ill bred and as ill taught . I serve a master who could show you how such things should be done . `` `` And how would he do it , O pink of squires ? `` `` He would neither be loud nor would he be unmannerly , but rather more gentle than is his wont . He would say , 'Sir , I should take it as an honor to do some small deed of arms against you , not for mine own glory or advancement , but rather for the fame of my lady and for the upholding of chivalry . ' Then he would draw his glove , thus , and throw it on the ground ; or , if he had cause to think that he had to deal with a churl , he might throw it in his face -- -as I do now ! `` A buzz of excitement went up from the knot of squires as Alleyne , his gentle nature turned by this causeless attack into fiery resolution , dashed his glove with all his strength into the sneering face of his antagonist . From all parts of the hall squires and pages came running , until a dense , swaying crowd surrounded the disputants . `` Your life for this ! '' said the bully , with a face which was distorted with rage . `` If you can take it , '' returned Alleyne . `` Good lad ! '' whispered Ford . `` Stick to it close as wax . `` `` I shall see justice , '' cried Norbury , Sir Oliver 's silent attendant . `` You brought it upon yourself , John Tranter , '' said the tall squire , who had been addressed as Roger Harcomb . `` You must ever plague the new-comers . But it were shame if this went further . The lad hath shown a proper spirit . `` `` But a blow ! a blow ! '' cried several of the older squires . `` There must be a finish to this . `` `` Nay ; Tranter first laid hand upon his head , '' said Harcomb . `` How say you , Tranter ? The matter may rest where it stands ? `` `` My name is known in these parts , '' said Tranter , proudly , `` I can let pass what might leave a stain upon another . Let him pick up his glove and say that he has done amiss . `` `` I would see him in the claws of the devil first , '' whispered Ford . `` You hear , young sir ? '' said the peacemaker . `` Our friend will overlook the matter if you do but say that you have acted in heat and haste . `` `` I can not say that , '' answered Alleyne . `` It is our custom , young sir , when new squires come amongst us from England , to test them in some such way . Bethink you that if a man have a destrier or a new lance he will ever try it in time of peace , lest in days of need it may fail him . How much more then is it proper to test those who are our comrades in arms . `` `` I would draw out if it may honorably be done , '' murmured Norbury in Alleyne 's ear . `` The man is a noted swordsman and far above your strength . `` Edricson came , however , of that sturdy Saxon blood which is very slowly heated , but once up not easily to be cooled . The hint of danger which Norbury threw out was the one thing needed to harden his resolution . `` I came here at the back of my master , '' he said , `` and I looked on every man here as an Englishman and a friend . This gentleman hath shown me a rough welcome , and if I have answered him in the same spirit he has but himself to thank . I will pick the glove up ; but , certes , I shall abide what I have done unless he first crave my pardon for what he hath said and done . `` Tranter shrugged his shoulders . `` You have done what you could to save him , Harcomb , '' said he . `` We had best settle at once . `` `` So say I , '' cried Alleyne . `` The council will not break up until the banquet , '' remarked a gray-haired squire . `` You have a clear two hours . `` `` And the place ? `` `` The tilting-yard is empty at this hour . `` `` Nay ; it must not be within the grounds of the court , or it may go hard with all concerned if it come to the ears of the prince . `` `` But there is a quiet spot near the river , '' said one youth . `` We have but to pass through the abbey grounds , along the armory wall , past the church of St. Remi , and so down the Rue des Apotres . `` `` En avant , then ! '' cried Tranter shortly , and the whole assembly flocked out into the open air , save only those whom the special orders of their masters held to their posts . These unfortunates crowded to the small casements , and craned their necks after the throng as far as they could catch a glimpse of them.Close to the banks of the Garonne there lay a little tract of green sward , with the high wall of a prior 's garden upon one side and an orchard with a thick bristle of leafless apple-trees upon the other . The river ran deep and swift up to the steep bank ; but there were few boats upon it , and the ships were moored far out in the centre of the stream . Here the two combatants drew their swords and threw off their doublets , for neither had any defensive armor . The duello with its stately etiquette had not yet come into vogue , but rough and sudden encounters were as common as they must ever be when hot-headed youth goes abroad with a weapon strapped to its waist . In such combats , as well as in the more formal sports of the tilting-yard , Tranter had won a name for strength and dexterity which had caused Norbury to utter his well-meant warning . On the other hand , Alleyne had used his weapons in constant exercise and practice on every day for many months , and being by nature quick of eye and prompt of hand , he might pass now as no mean swordsman . A strangely opposed pair they appeared as they approached each other : Tranter dark and stout and stiff , with hairy chest and corded arms , Alleyne a model of comeliness and grace , with his golden hair and his skin as fair as a woman 's . An unequal fight it seemed to most ; but there were a few , and they the most experienced , who saw something in the youth 's steady gray eye and wary step which left the issue open to doubt . `` Hold , sirs , hold ! '' cried Norbury , ere a blow had been struck . `` This gentleman hath a two-handed sword , a good foot longer than that of our friend . `` `` Take mine , Alleyne , '' said Ford . `` Nay , friends , '' he answered , `` I understand the weight and balance of mine own . To work , sir , for our lord may need us at the abbey ! `` Tranter 's great sword was indeed a mighty vantage in his favor . He stood with his feet close together , his knees bent outwards , ready for a dash inwards or a spring out . The weapon he held straight up in front of him with blade erect , so that he might either bring it down with a swinging blow , or by a turn of the heavy blade he might guard his own head and body . A further protection lay in the broad and powerful guard which crossed the hilt , and which was furnished with a deep and narrow notch , in which an expert swordsman might catch his foeman 's blade , and by a quick turn of his wrist might snap it across . Alleyne , on the other hand , must trust for his defence to his quick eye and active foot -- -for his sword , though keen as a whetstone could make it , was of a light and graceful build with a narrow , sloping pommel and a tapering steel.Tranter well knew his advantage and lost no time in putting it to use . As his opponent walked towards him he suddenly bounded forward and sent in a whistling cut which would have severed the other in twain had he not sprung lightly back from it . So close was it that the point ripped a gash in the jutting
