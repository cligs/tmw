Island , cottonwoods -- -Ah , here we are . 'The aborigines of the Andaman Islands may perhaps claim the distinction of being the smallest race upon this earth , though some anthropologists prefer the Bushmen of Africa , the Digger Indians of America , and the Terra del Fuegians . The average height is rather below four feet , although many full-grown adults may be found who are very much smaller than this . They are a fierce , morose , and intractable people , though capable of forming most devoted friendships when their confidence has once been gained . ' Mark that , Watson . Now , then , listen to this . 'They are naturally hideous , having large , misshapen heads , small , fierce eyes , and distorted features . Their feet and hands , however , are remarkably small . So intractable and fierce are they that all the efforts of the British official have failed to win them over in any degree . They have always been a terror to shipwrecked crews , braining the survivors with their stone-headed clubs , or shooting them with their poisoned arrows . These massacres are invariably concluded by a cannibal feast . ' Nice , amiable people , Watson ! If this fellow had been left to his own unaided devices this affair might have taken an even more ghastly turn . I fancy that , even as it is , Jonathan Small would give a good deal not to have employed him . `` `` But how came he to have so singular a companion ? `` `` Ah , that is more than I can tell . Since , however , we had already determined that Small had come from the Andamans , it is not so very wonderful that this islander should be with him . No doubt we shall know all about it in time . Look here , Watson ; you look regularly done . Lie down there on the sofa , and see if I can put you to sleep . `` He took up his violin from the corner , and as I stretched myself out he began to play some low , dreamy , melodious air , -- -his own , no doubt , for he had a remarkable gift for improvisation . I have a vague remembrance of his gaunt limbs , his earnest face , and the rise and fall of his bow . Then I seemed to be floated peacefully away upon a soft sea of sound , until I found myself in dream-land , with the sweet face of Mary Morstan looking down upon me.It was late in the afternoon before I woke , strengthened and refreshed . Sherlock Holmes still sat exactly as I had left him , save that he had laid aside his violin and was deep in a book . He looked across at me , as I stirred , and I noticed that his face was dark and troubled . `` You have slept soundly , '' he said . `` I feared that our talk would wake you . `` `` I heard nothing , '' I answered . `` Have you had fresh news , then ? `` `` Unfortunately , no . I confess that I am surprised and disappointed . I expected something definite by this time . Wiggins has just been up to report . He says that no trace can be found of the launch . It is a provoking check , for every hour is of importance . `` `` Can I do anything ? I am perfectly fresh now , and quite ready for another night 's outing . `` `` No , we can do nothing . We can only wait . If we go ourselves , the message might come in our absence , and delay be caused . You can do what you will , but I must remain on guard . `` `` Then I shall run over to Camberwell and call upon Mrs. Cecil Forrester . She asked me to , yesterday . `` `` On Mrs. Cecil Forrester ? '' asked Holmes , with the twinkle of a smile in his eyes . `` Well , of course Miss Morstan too . They were anxious to hear what happened . `` `` I would not tell them too much , '' said Holmes . `` Women are never to be entirely trusted , -- -not the best of them . `` I did not pause to argue over this atrocious sentiment . `` I shall be back in an hour or two , '' I remarked . `` All right ! Good luck ! But , I say , if you are crossing the river you may as well return Toby , for I do n't think it is at all likely that we shall have any use for him now . `` I took our mongrel accordingly , and left him , together with a half-sovereign , at the old naturalist 's in Pinchin Lane . At Camberwell I found Miss Morstan a little weary after her night 's adventures , but very eager to hear the news . Mrs. Forrester , too , was full of curiosity . I told them all that we had done , suppressing , however , the more dreadful parts of the tragedy . Thus , although I spoke of Mr. Sholto 's death , I said nothing of the exact manner and method of it . With all my omissions , however , there was enough to startle and amaze them . `` It is a romance ! '' cried Mrs. Forrester . `` An injured lady , half a million in treasure , a black cannibal , and a wooden-legged ruffian . They take the place of the conventional dragon or wicked earl . `` `` And two knight-errants to the rescue , '' added Miss Morstan , with a bright glance at me . `` Why , Mary , your fortune depends upon the issue of this search . I do n't think that you are nearly excited enough . Just imagine what it must be to be so rich , and to have the world at your feet ! `` It sent a little thrill of joy to my heart to notice that she showed no sign of elation at the prospect . On the contrary , she gave a toss of her proud head , as though the matter were one in which she took small interest . `` It is for Mr. Thaddeus Sholto that I am anxious , '' she said . `` Nothing else is of any consequence ; but I think that he has behaved most kindly and honorably throughout . It is our duty to clear him of this dreadful and unfounded charge . `` It was evening before I left Camberwell , and quite dark by the time I reached home . My companion 's book and pipe lay by his chair , but he had disappeared . I looked about in the hope of seeing a note , but there was none . `` I suppose that Mr. Sherlock Holmes has gone out , '' I said to Mrs. Hudson as she came up to lower the blinds . `` No , sir . He has gone to his room , sir . Do you know , sir , '' sinking her voice into an impressive whisper , `` I am afraid for his health ? `` `` Why so , Mrs . Hudson ? `` `` Well , he 's that strange , sir . After you was gone he walked and he walked , up and down , and up and down , until I was weary of the sound of his footstep . Then I heard him talking to himself and muttering , and every time the bell rang out he came on the stairhead , with 'What is that , Mrs . Hudson ? ' And now he has slammed off to his room , but I can hear him walking away the same as ever . I hope he 's not going to be ill , sir . I ventured to say something to him about cooling medicine , but he turned on me , sir , with such a look that I do n't know how ever I got out of the room . `` `` I do n't think that you have any cause to be uneasy , Mrs. Hudson , '' I answered . `` I have seen him like this before . He has some small matter upon his mind which makes him restless . '' I tried to speak lightly to our worthy landlady , but I was myself somewhat uneasy when through the long night I still from time to time heard the dull sound of his tread , and knew how his keen spirit was chafing against this involuntary inaction.At breakfast-time he looked worn and haggard , with a little fleck of feverish color upon either cheek . `` You are knocking yourself up , old man , '' I remarked . `` I heard you marching about in the night . `` `` No , I could not sleep , '' he answered . `` This infernal problem is consuming me . It is too much to be balked by so petty an obstacle , when all else had been overcome . I know the men , the launch , everything ; and yet I can get no news . I have set other agencies at work , and used every means at my disposal . The whole river has been searched on either side , but there is no news , nor has Mrs. Smith heard of her husband . I shall come to the conclusion soon that they have scuttled the craft . But there are objections to that . `` `` Or that Mrs. Smith has put us on a wrong scent . `` `` No , I think that may be dismissed . I had inquiries made , and there is a launch of that description . `` `` Could it have gone up the river ? `` `` I have considered that possibility too , and there is a search-party who will work up as far as Richmond . If no news comes to-day , I shall start off myself to-morrow , and go for the men rather than the boat . But surely , surely , we shall hear something . `` We did not , however . Not a word came to us either from Wiggins or from the other agencies . There were articles in most of the papers upon the Norwood tragedy . They all appeared to be rather hostile to the unfortunate Thaddeus Sholto . No fresh details were to be found , however , in any of them , save that an inquest was to be held upon the following day . I walked over to Camberwell in the evening to report our ill success to the ladies , and on my return I found Holmes dejected and somewhat morose . He would hardly reply to my questions , and busied himself all evening in an abstruse chemical analysis which involved much heating of retorts and distilling of vapors , ending at last in a smell which fairly drove me out of the apartment . Up to the small hours of the morning I could hear the clinking of his test-tubes which told me that he was still engaged in his malodorous experiment.In the early dawn I woke with a start , and was surprised to find him standing by my bedside , clad in a rude sailor dress with a pea-jacket
