current which swirls like the Gulf Stream through the ocean of ether . You will also kindly note for your own future convenience that to-day is not Friday , August the twenty-seventh , but Saturday , August the twenty-eighth , and that you sat senseless in your cab for twenty-eight hours upon the Rotherfield hill . `` And `` right here , '' as my American colleague would say , I may bring this narrative to an end . It is , as you are probably aware , only a fuller and more detailed version of the account which appeared in the Monday edition of the Daily Gazette -- -an account which has been universally admitted to be the greatest journalistic scoop of all time , which sold no fewer than three-and-a-half million copies of the paper . Framed upon the wall of my sanctum I retain those magnificent headlines : -- - *UNPRECEDENTED EXPERIENCE **CHALLENGER JUSTIFIED **OUR CORRESPONDENT ESCAPES **ENTHRALLING NARRATIVE **THE OXYGEN ROOM **WEIRD MOTOR DRIVE **DEAD LONDON **REPLACING THE MISSING PAGE **GREAT FIRES AND LOSS OF LIFE **WILL IT RECUR ? *Underneath this glorious scroll came nine and a half columns of narrative , in which appeared the first , last , and only account of the history of the planet , so far as one observer could draw it , during one long day of its existence . Challenger and Summerlee have treated the matter in a joint scientific paper , but to me alone was left the popular account . Surely I can sing `` Nunc dimittis . '' What is left but anti-climax in the life of a journalist after that ! But let me not end on sensational headlines and a merely personal triumph . Rather let me quote the sonorous passages in which the greatest of daily papers ended its admirable leader upon the subject -- -a leader which might well be filed for reference by every thoughtful man . `` It has been a well-worn truism , '' said the Times , `` that our human race are a feeble folk before the infinite latent forces which surround us . From the prophets of old and from the philosophers of our own time the same message and warning have reached us . But , like all oft-repeated truths , it has in time lost something of its actuality and cogency . A lesson , an actual experience , was needed to bring it home . It is from that salutory but terrible ordeal that we have just emerged , with minds which are still stunned by the suddenness of the blow and with spirits which are chastened by the realization of our own limitations and impotence . The world has paid a fearful price for its schooling . Hardly yet have we learned the full tale of disaster , but the destruction by fire of New York , of Orleans , and of Brighton constitutes in itself one of the greatest tragedies in the history of our race . When the account of the railway and shipping accidents has been completed , it will furnish grim reading , although there is evidence to show that in the vast majority of cases the drivers of trains and engineers of steamers succeeded in shutting off their motive power before succumbing to the poison . But the material damage , enormous as it is both in life and in property , is not the consideration which will be uppermost in our minds to-day . All this may in time be forgotten . But what will not be forgotten , and what will and should continue to obsess our imaginations , is this revelation of the possibilities of the universe , this destruction of our ignorant self-complacency , and this demonstration of how narrow is the path of our material existence and what abysses may lie upon either side of it . Solemnity and humility are at the base of all our emotions to-day . May they be the foundations upon which a more earnest and reverent race may build a more worthy temple . ''
