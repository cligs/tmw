it was a very great liberty indeed on the part of a lady whom I had only met once . But , after all , I had challenged her by my scepticism . It may have been , as she said , a little difficult to devise a test which would satisfy me.And she had done that . There could be no question at all upon the point . For me hypnotic suggestion was finally established . It took its place from now onward as one of the facts of life . That Agatha , who of all women of my acquaintance has the best balanced mind , had been reduced to a condition of automatism appeared to be certain . A person at a distance had worked her as an engineer on the shore might guide a Brennan torpedo . A second soul had stepped in , as it were , had pushed her own aside , and had seized her nervous mechanism , saying : `` I will work this for half an hour . '' And Agatha must have been unconscious as she came and as she returned . Could she make her way in safety through the streets in such a state ? I put on my hat and hurried round to see if all was well with her.Yes . She was at home . I was shown into the drawing-room and found her sitting with a book upon her lap . `` You are an early visitor , Austin , '' said she , smiling . `` And you have been an even earlier one , '' I answered.She looked puzzled . `` What do you mean ? '' she asked . `` You have not been out to-day ? `` `` No , certainly not . `` `` Agatha , '' said I seriously , `` would you mind telling me exactly what you have done this morning ? `` She laughed at my earnestness . `` You 've got on your professional look , Austin . See what comes of being engaged to a man of science . However , I will tell you , though I ca n't imagine what you want to know for . I got up at eight . I breakfasted at half-past . I came into this room at ten minutes past nine and began to read the 'Memoirs of Mme . de Remusat . ' In a few minutes I did the French lady the bad compliment of dropping to sleep over her pages , and I did you , sir , the very flattering one of dreaming about you . It is only a few minutes since I woke up . `` `` And found yourself where you had been before ? `` `` Why , where else should I find myself ? `` `` Would you mind telling me , Agatha , what it was that you dreamed about me ? It really is not mere curiosity on my part . `` `` I merely had a vague impression that you came into it . I can not recall any thing definite . `` `` If you have not been out to-day , Agatha , how is it that your shoes are dusty ? `` A pained look came over her face . `` Really , Austin , I do not know what is the matter with you this morning . One would almost think that you doubted my word . If my boots are dusty , it must be , of course , that I have put on a pair which the maid had not cleaned . `` It was perfectly evident that she knew nothing whatever about the matter , and I reflected that , after all , perhaps it was better that I should not enlighten her . It might frighten her , and could serve no good purpose that I could see . I said no more about it , therefore , and left shortly afterward to give my lecture.But I am immensely impressed . My horizon of scientific possibilities has suddenly been enormously extended . I no longer wonder at Wilson 's demonic energy and enthusiasm . Who would not work hard who had a vast virgin field ready to his hand ? Why , I have known the novel shape of a nucleolus , or a trifling peculiarity of striped muscular fibre seen under a 300-diameter lens , fill me with exultation . How petty do such researches seem when compared with this one which strikes at the very roots of life and the nature of the soul ! I had always looked upon spirit as a product of matter . The brain , I thought , secreted the mind , as the liver does the bile . But how can this be when I see mind working from a distance and playing upon matter as a musician might upon a violin ? The body does not give rise to the soul , then , but is rather the rough instrument by which the spirit manifests itself . The windmill does not give rise to the wind , but only indicates it . It was opposed to my whole habit of thought , and yet it was undeniably possible and worthy of investigation.And why should I not investigate it ? I see that under yesterday 's date I said : `` If I could see something positive and objective , I might be tempted to approach it from the physiological aspect . '' Well , I have got my test . I shall be as good as my word . The investigation would , I am sure , be of immense interest . Some of my colleagues might look askance at it , for science is full of unreasoning prejudices , but if Wilson has the courage of his convictions , I can afford to have it also . I shall go to him to-morrow morning -- -to him and to Miss Penclosa . If she can show us so much , it is probable that she can show us more.March 26 . Wilson was , as I had anticipated , very exultant over my conversion , and Miss Penclosa was also demurely pleased at the result of her experiment . Strange what a silent , colorless creature she is save only when she exercises her power ! Even talking about it gives her color and life . She seems to take a singular interest in me . I can not help observing how her eyes follow me about the room.We had the most interesting conversation about her own powers . It is just as well to put her views on record , though they can not , of course , claim any scientific weight . `` You are on the very fringe of the subject , '' said she , when I had expressed wonder at the remarkable instance of suggestion which she had shown me . `` I had no direct influence upon Miss Marden when she came round to you . I was not even thinking of her that morning . What I did was to set her mind as I might set the alarum of a clock so that at the hour named it would go off of its own accord . If six months instead of twelve hours had been suggested , it would have been the same . `` `` And if the suggestion had been to assassinate me ? `` `` She would most inevitably have done so . `` `` But this is a terrible power ! '' I cried . `` It is , as you say , a terrible power , '' she answered gravely , `` and the more you know of it the more terrible will it seem to you . `` `` May I ask , '' said I , `` what you meant when you said that this matter of suggestion is only at the fringe of it ? What do you consider the essential ? `` `` I had rather not tell you . `` I was surprised at the decision of her answer . `` You understand , '' said I , `` that it is not out of curiosity I ask , but in the hope that I may find some scientific explanation for the facts with which you furnish me . `` `` Frankly , Professor Gilroy , '' said she , `` I am not at all interested in science , nor do I care whether it can or can not classify these powers . `` `` But I was hoping -- -- -- '' '' Ah , that is quite another thing . If you make it a personal matter , '' said she , with the pleasantest of smiles , `` I shall be only too happy to tell you any thing you wish to know . Let me see ; what was it you asked me ? Oh , about the further powers . Professor Wilson wo n't believe in them , but they are quite true all the same . For example , it is possible for an operator to gain complete command over his subject -- - presuming that the latter is a good one . Without any previous suggestion he may make him do whatever he likes . `` `` Without the subject 's knowledge ? `` `` That depends . If the force were strongly exerted , he would know no more about it than Miss Marden did when she came round and frightened you so . Or , if the influence was less powerful , he might be conscious of what he was doing , but be quite unable to prevent himself from doing it . `` `` Would he have lost his own will power , then ? `` `` It would be over-ridden by another stronger one . `` `` Have you ever exercised this power yourself ? `` `` Several times . `` `` Is your own will so strong , then ? `` `` Well , it does not entirely depend upon that . Many have strong wills which are not detachable from themselves . The thing is to have the gift of projecting it into another person and superseding his own . I find that the power varies with my own strength and health . `` `` Practically , you send your soul into another person 's body . `` `` Well , you might put it that way . `` `` And what does your own body do ? `` `` It merely feels lethargic . `` `` Well , but is there no danger to your own health ? '' I asked . `` There might be a little . You have to be careful never to let your own consciousness absolutely go ; otherwise , you might experience some difficulty in finding your way back again . You must always preserve the connection , as it were . I am afraid I express myself very badly , Professor Gilroy , but of course I do n't know how to put these things in a scientific way . I am just giving you my own experiences and my own explanations . `` Well , I read this over now at my leisure , and I marvel at myself ! Is this Austin Gilroy , the man who has won his way to the front by his hard reasoning power and by his devotion to fact ? Here I am gravely retailing the gossip of a woman who tells me how her soul may be projected from her body , and how , while she lies in a lethargy , she can control the actions of people at a distance . Do I accept it ?
