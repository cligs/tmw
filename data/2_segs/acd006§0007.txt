done more than all the talkers and the writers to ring this planet round with a crimson girdle of British possessions . `` Wonder whether Jack Garraway is ready ! '' he murmured , throwing down theScotsman , and staring up at the roof . `` It 's nearly eleven o'clock . `` He rose with a yawn , picked up the poker , stood upon the chair , and banged three times upon the ceiling . Three muffled taps responded from the room above . Dimsdale stepped down and began slowly to discard his coat and his waistcoat . As he did so there was a quick , active step upon the stair , and a lean , wiry-looking , middle-sized young fellow stepped into the room . With a nod of greeting he pushed the table over to one side , threw off his two upper garments , and pulled on a pair of the boxing-gloves from the corner . Dimsdale had already done the same , and was standing , a model of manly grace and strength , in the centre of the room . `` Practice your lead , Jack . About here . '' He tapped the centre of his forehead with his swollen gauntlet.His companion poised himself for a moment , and then , lashing out with his left hand , came home with a heavy thud on the place indicated . Dimsdale smiled gently and shook his head . `` It wo n't do , '' he said . `` I hit my hardest , '' the other answered apologetically . `` It wo n't do . Try again . `` The visitor repeated the blow with all the force that he could command.Dimsdale shook his head again despondently . `` You do n't seem to catch it , '' he said . `` It 's like this . '' He leaned forward , there was the sound of a sharp clip , and the novice shot across the room with a force that nearly sent his skull through the panel of the door . `` That 's it , '' said Dimsdale mildly . `` Oh , it is , is it ? '' the other responded , rubbing his head . `` It 's deucedly interesting , but I think I would understand it better ifI saw you do it to some one else . It is something between the explosionof a powder magazine and a natural convulsion . `` His instructor smiled grimly . `` That 's the only way to learn , '' he said . `` Now we shall have three minutes of give-and-take , and so ends the morning lesson . `` While this little scene was being enacted in the lodgings of the student , a very stout little elderly man was walking slowly down Howe Street , glancing up at the numbers upon the doors . He was square and deep and broad , like a bottle of Geneva , with a large ruddy face and a pair of bright black eyes , which were shrewd and critical , and yet had a merry twinkle of eternal boyishness in their depths . Bushy side whiskers , shot with grey , flanked his rubicund visage , and he threw out his feet as he walked with the air of a man who is on good terms with himself and with every one around him.At No.13 he stopped and rapped loudly upon the door with the head of his metal-headed stick . `` Mrs . McTavish ? '' he asked , as a hard-lined , angular woman responded to his summons . `` That 's me , sir. '' '' Mr . Dimsdale lives with you , I believe ? `` `` Third floor front , sir . `` `` Is he in ? `` Suspicion shone in the woman 's eyes . `` Was it aboot a bill ? '' she asked . `` A bill , my good woman ! No , no , nothing of the kind . Dr. Dimsdale is my name . I am the lad 's father -- -just come up from London to see him . I hope he has not been overworking himself ? `` A ghost of a smile played about the woman 's face . `` I think not , sir , '' she answered . `` I almost wish I had come round in the afternoon , '' said the visitor , standing with his thick legs astride upon the door-mat . `` It seems a pity to break his chain of thought . The morning is his time for study. '' '' Houts ! I wouldna ' fash aboot that. '' '' Well ! well ! The third floor , you say . He did not expect me so early , I shall surprise the dear boy at his work . `` The landlady stood listening expectantly in the passage . The sturdy little man plodded heavily up the first flight of stairs . He paused on the landing . `` Dear me ! '' he murmured . `` Some one is beating carpets . How can they expect poor Tom to read ? `` At the second landing the noise was much louder . `` It must be a dancing school , '' conjectured the doctor.When he reached his son 's door , however , there could no longer be any doubt as to whence the sounds proceeded . There was the stamp and shuffle of feet , the hissing of in-drawn breath , and an occasional soft thud , as if some one were butting his head against a bale of wool . `` It 's epilepsy , '' gasped the doctor , and turning the handle he rushed into the room.One hurried glance showed him the struggle which was going on . There was no time to note details . Some maniac was assaulting his Tom . He sprang at the man , seized him round the waist , dragged him to the ground , and seated himself upon him . `` Now tie his hands , '' he said complacently , as he balanced himself upon the writhing figure.It took some little time before his son , who was half-choked with laughter , could explain to the energetic doctor that the gentleman upon whom he was perched was not a dangerous lunatic , but , on the contrary , a very harmless and innocent member of society . When at last it was made clear to him , the doctor released his prisoner and was profuse in his apologies . `` This is my father , Garraway , '' said Dimsdale . `` I hardly expected him so early . `` `` I must offer you a thousand apologies , sir . The fact is that I am rather short-sighted , and had no time to put my glasses on . It seemed to me to be a most dangerous scuffle . `` `` Do n't mention it , sir , '' said Garraway , with great good humour . `` And you , Tom , you rogue , is this the way you spend your mornings ? I expected to find you deep in your books . I told your landlady that I hardly liked to come up for fear of disturbing you at your work . You go up for your first professional in a few weeks , I understand ? `` `` That will be all right , dad , '' said his son demurely . `` Garraway and I usually take a little exercise of this sort as a preliminary to the labours of the day . Try this armchair and have a cigarette . `` The doctor 's eye fell upon the medical works and the disarticulated skull , and his ill-humour departed . `` You have your tools close at hand , I see , '' he remarked . `` Yes , dad , all ready . `` `` Those bones bring back old memories to me . I am rusty in my anatomy , but I dare say I could stump you yet . Let me see now . What are the different foramina of the sphenoid bone , and what structures pass through them ? Eh ? '' '' Coming ! '' yelled his son . `` Coming ! '' and dashed out of the room . `` I did n't hear any one call , '' observed the doctor . `` Did n't you , sir ? '' said Garraway , pulling on his coat . `` I thought I heard a noise . `` `` You read with my son , I believe ? `` `` Yes , sir . `` `` Then perhaps you can tell me what the structures are which pass through the foramina of the sphenoid ? `` `` Oh yes , sir . There is the -- -All right , Tom , all right ! Excuse me , sir ! He is calling me ; '' and Garraway vanished as precipitately as his friend had done . The doctor sat alone , puffing at his cigarette , and brooding over his own dullness of hearing.Presently the two students returned , looking just a little shame-faced , and plunged instantly into wild talk about the weather , the town , and the University -- -anything and everything except the sphenoid bone . `` You have come in good time to see something of University life , '' said young Dimsdale . `` To-day we elect our new Lord Rector . Garraway and I will take you down and show you the sights . `` `` I have often wished to see something of it , '' his father answered . `` I was apprenticed to my profession , Mr. Garraway , in the old-fashioned way , and had few opportunities of attending college . `` `` Indeed , sir . `` `` But I can imagine it all . What can be more charming than the sight of a community of young men all striving after knowledge , and emulating each other in the ardour of their studies ? Not that I would grudge them recreation . I can fancy them strolling in bands round the classic precincts of their venerable University , and amusing themselves by discussing the rival theories of physiologists or the latest additions to the pharmacopoeia . `` Garraway had listened with becoming gravity to the commencement of this speech , but at the last sentence he choked and vanished for the second time out of the room . `` Your friend seems amused , '' remarked Dr. Dimsdale mildly. '' Yes . He gets taken like that sometimes , '' said his son . `` His brothers are just the same . I have hardly had a chance yet to say how glad I am to see you , dad . `` `` And I to see you , my dear boy . Your mother and Kate come up by the night train . I have private rooms at the hotel . `` `` Kate Harston ! I can only remember her as a little quiet girl with long brown hair . That was six years ago . She promised to be pretty . `` `` Then she has fulfilled her promise . But you shall judge that for yourself . She is the ward of John Girdlestone , the African merchant , but we are the only relations she has upon earth . Her father was my second cousin . She spends a good deal of her time now with us at Phillimore Gardens -- -as much as her guardian will allow . He prefers to have her under his own roof , and I do n't blame him , for
