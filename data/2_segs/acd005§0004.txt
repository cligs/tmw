Hurons at Lorette , and Algonquins along the whole rivercotesfrom Tadousac in the East to Sault la Marie , and even the great plains of the Dakotas , who have all taken the cross as their token . Marquette has passed down the river of the West to preach among the Illinois , and Jesuits have carried the Gospel to the warriors of the Long House in their wigwams at Onondaga . `` `` I may add , your Majesty , '' said Pere la Chaise , `` that in leaving the truth there , they have too often left their lives with it . `` `` Yes , sire , it is very true , '' cried De Frontenac cordially . `` Your Majesty has many brave men within your domains , but none braver than these . They have come back up the Richelieu River from the Iroquois villages with their nails gone , their fingers torn out , a cinder where their eye should be , and the scars of the pine splinters as thick upon their bodies as thefleurs-de-lison yonder curtain . Yet , with a month of nursing from the good Ursulines , they have used their remaining eye to guide them back to the Indian country once more , where even the dogs have been frightened at their haggled faces and twisted limbs . `` `` And you have suffered this ? '' cried Louis hotly . `` You allow these infamous assassins to live ? `` `` I have asked for troops , sire . `` `` And I have sent some . `` `` One regiment . `` `` The Carignan-Saliere . I have no better in my service . `` But more is needed , sire . `` `` There are the Canadians themselves . Have you not a militia ? Could you not raise force enough to punish these rascally murderers of God 's priests ? I had always understood that you were a soldier . `` De Frontenac 's eyes flashed , and a quick answer seemed for an instant to tremble upon his lips , but with an effort the fiery old man restrained himself . `` Your Majesty will learn best whether I am a soldier or not , '' said he , `` by asking those who have seen me at Seneffe , Mulhausen , Salzbach , and half a score of other places where I had the honour of upholding your Majesty 's cause . `` `` Your services have not been forgotten . `` `` It is just because I am a soldier and have seen something of war that I know how hard it is to penetrate into a country much larger than the Lowlands , all thick with forest and bog , with a savage lurking behind every tree , who , if he has not learned to step in time or to form line , can at least bring down the running caribou at two hundred paces , and travel three leagues to your one . And then when you have at last reached their villages , and burned their empty wigwams and a few acres of maize fields , what the better are you then ? You can but travel back again to your own land with a cloud of unseen men lurking behind you , and a scalp-yell for every straggler . You are a soldier yourself , sire . I ask you if such a war is an easy task for a handful of soldiers , with a fewcensitairesstraight from the plough , and a troop ofcoureurs-de-boiswhose hearts are all the time are with their traps and their beaver-skins . `` `` No , no ; I am sorry if I spoke too hastily , '' said Louis . `` We shall look into the matter at our council . `` `` Then it warms my heart to hear you say so , '' cried the old governor . `` There will be joy down the long St. Lawrence , in white hearts and in red , when it is known that their great father over the waters has turned his mind towards them . `` `` And yet you must not look for too much , for Canada has been a heavy cost to us , and we have many calls in Europe . `` `` Ah , sire , I would that you could see that great land . When your Majesty has won a campaign over here , what may come of it ? Glory , a few miles of land Luxembourg , Strassburg , one more city in the kingdom ; but over there , with a tenth of the cost and a hundredth part of the force , there is a world ready to your hand . It is so vast , sire , so rich , so beautiful ! Where are there such hills , such forests , such rivers ? And it is all for us if we will but take it . Who is there to stand in our way ? A few nations of scattered Indians and a thin strip of English farmers and fishermen . Turn your thoughts there , sire , and in a few years you would be able to stand upon your citadel at Quebec , and to say there is one great empire here from the snows of the North to the warm Southern Gulf , and from the waves of the ocean to the great plains beyond Marquette 's river , and the name of this empire is France , and her king is Louis , and her flag is thefleurs-de-lis . `` Louis 's cheek had flushed at this ambitious picture , and he had leaned forward in his chair , with flashing eyes , but he sank back again as the governor concluded . `` On my word , count , '' said he , `` you have caught something of this gift ofIndian eloquence of which we have heard . But about these English folk.They are Huguenots , are they not ? `` `` For the most part . Especially in the North . `` `` Then it might be a service to Holy Church to send them packing . They have a city there , I am told . New -- -New -- -How do they call it ? `` `` New York , sire . They took it from the Dutch . `` `` Ah , New York . And have I not heard of another ? Bos -- -Bos -- - '' '' Boston , sire . `` `` That is the name . The harbours might be of service to us . Tell me , now , Frontenac , '' lowering his voice so that his words might be audible only to the count , Louvois , and the royal circle , `` what force would you need to clear these people out ? One regiment , two regiments , and perhaps a frigate or two ? `` But the ex-governor shook his grizzled head . `` You do not know them , sire , '' said he . `` They are stern folk , these . We in Canada , with all your gracious help , have found it hard to hold our own . Yet these men have had no help , but only hindrance , with cold and disease , and barren lands , and Indian wars , but they have thriven and multiplied until the woods thin away in front of them like ice in the sun , and their church bells are heard where but yesterday the wolves were howling . They are peaceful folk , and slow to war , but when they have set their hands to it , though they may be slack to begin , they are slacker still to cease . To put New England into your Majesty 's hands , I would ask fifteen thousand of your best troops and twenty ships of the line . `` Louis sprang impatiently from his chair , and caught up his cane . `` I wish , '' said he , `` that you would imitate these people who seem to you to be so formidable , in their excellent habit of doing things for themselves . The matter may stand until our council . Reverend father , it has struck the hour of chapel , and all else may wait until we have paid out duties to heaven . '' Taking a missal from the hands of an attendant , he walked as fast as his very high heels would permit him , towards the door , the court forming a lane through which he might pass , and then closing up behind to follow him in order of precedence.Whilst Louis had been affording his court that which he had openly stated to be the highest of human pleasures -- -the sight of the royal face -- -the young officer of the guard outside had been very busy passing on the titles of the numerous applicants for admission , and exchanging usually a smile or a few words of greeting with them , for his frank , handsome face was a well-known one at the court . With his merry eyes and his brisk bearing , he looked like a man who was on good terms with Fortune . Indeed , he had good cause to be so , for she had used him well . Three years ago he had been an unknown subaltern bush-fighting with Algonquins and Iroquois in the wilds of Canada . An exchange had brought him back to France and into the regiment of Picardy , but the lucky chance of having seized the bridle of the king 's horse one winter 's day in Fontainebleau when the creature was plunging within a few yards of a deep gravel-pit had done for him what ten campaigns might have failed to accomplish . Now as a trusted officer of the king 's guard , young , gallant , and popular , his lot was indeed an enviable one . And yet , with the strange perversity of human nature , he was already surfeited with the dull if magnificent routine of the king 's household , and looked back with regret to the rougher and freer days of his early service . Even there at the royal door his mind had turned away from the frescoed passage and the groups of courtiers to the wild ravines and foaming rivers of the West , when suddenly his eyes lit upon a face which he had last seen among those very scenes . `` Ah , Monsieur de Frontenac ! '' he cried . `` You can not have forgotten me. '' '' What ! De Catinat ! Ah , it is a joy indeed to see a face from over the water ! But there is a long step between a subaltern in the Carignan and a captain in the guards . You have risen rapidly . `` `` Yes ; and yet I may be none the happier for it . There are times when I would give it all to be dancing down the Lachine Rapids in a birch canoe , or to see the red and the yellow on those hill-sides once more at the fall of the leaf . `` `` Ay , '' sighed De Frontenac . `` You know that my fortunes have sunk as yours have risen . I have been recalled , and De la Barre is in my place . But there will be a storm there which such a man as he can never stand against . With the Iroquois all dancing the scalp-dance , and Dongan behind them in New York to whoop
