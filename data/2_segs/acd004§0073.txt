upon such runagate knaves . `` There was little fight left in the peasants , however , still dazed by the explosion , amazed at their own losses and disheartened by the arrival of the disciplined archers . In a very few minutes they were in full flight for their brushwood homes , leaving the morning sun to rise upon a blackened and blood-stained ruin , where it had left the night before the magnificent castle of the Seneschal of Auvergne . Already the white lines in the east were deepening into pink as the archers gathered round the keep and took counsel how to rescue the survivors . `` Had we a rope , '' said Alleyne , `` there is one side which is not yet on fire , down which we might slip . `` `` But how to get a rope ? `` `` It is an old trick , '' quoth Aylward . `` Hola ! Johnston , cast me up a rope , even as you did at Maupertuis in the war time . `` The grizzled archer thus addressed took several lengths of rope from his comrades , and knotting them firmly together , he stretched them out in the long shadow which the rising sun threw from the frowning keep . Then he fixed the yew-stave of his bow upon end and measured the long , thin , black line which it threw upon the turf . `` A six-foot stave throws a twelve-foot shadow , '' he muttered . `` The keep throws a shadow of sixty paces . Thirty paces of rope will be enow and to spare . Another strand , Watkin ! Now pull at the end that all may be safe . So ! It is ready for them . `` `` But how are they to reach it ? '' asked the young archer beside him . `` Watch and see , young fool's-head , '' growled the old bowman . He took a long string from his pouch and fastened one end to an arrow . `` All ready , Samkin ? `` `` Ready , camarade . `` `` Close to your hand then . '' With an easy pull he sent the shaft flickering gently up , falling upon the stonework within a foot of where Aylward was standing . The other end was secured to the rope , so that in a minute a good strong cord was dangling from the only sound side of the blazing and shattered tower . The Lady Tiphaine was lowered with a noose drawn fast under the arms , and the other five slid swiftly down , amid the cheers and joyous outcry of their rescuers . `` Where is Sir Claude Latour ? '' asked Sir Nigel , as his feet touched ground . `` He is in camp , near Montpezat , two hours ' march from here , my fair lord , '' said Johnston , the grizzled bowman who commanded the archers . `` Then we shall march thither , for I would fain have you all back at Dax in time to be in the prince 's vanguard . `` `` My lord , '' cried Alleyne , joyfully , `` here are our chargers in the field , and I see your harness amid the plunder which these rogues have left behind them . `` `` By Saint Ives ! you speak sooth , young squire , '' said Du Guesclin . `` There is my horse and my lady 's jennet . The knaves led them from the stables , but fled without them . Now , Nigel , it is great joy to me to have seen one of whom I have often heard . Yet we must leave you now , for I must be with the King of Spain ere your army crosses the mountains . `` `` I had thought that you were in Spain with the valiant Henry of Trastamare . `` `` I have been there , but I came to France to raise succor for him . I shall ride back , Nigel , with four thousand of the best lances of France at my back , so that your prince may find he hath a task which is worthy of him . God be with you , friend , and may we meet again in better times ! `` `` I do not think , '' said Sir Nigel , as he stood by Alleyne 's side looking after the French knight and his lady , `` that in all Christendom you will meet with a more stout-hearted man or a fairer and sweeter dame . But your face is pale and sad , Alleyne ! Have you perchance met with some hurt during the ruffle ? `` `` Nay , my fair lord , I was but thinking of my friend Ford , and how he sat upon my couch no later than yesternight . `` Sir Nigel shook his head sadly . `` Two brave squires have I lost , '' said he . `` I know not why the young shoots should be plucked , and an old weed left standing , yet certes there must be some good reason , since God hath so planned it . Did you not note , Alleyne , that the Lady Tiphaine did give us warning last night that danger was coming upon us ? `` `` She did , my lord . `` `` By Saint Paul ! my mind misgives me as to what she saw at Twynham Castle . And yet I can not think that any Scottish or French rovers could land in such force as to beleaguer the fortalice . Call the Company together , Aylward ; and let us on , for it will be shame to us if we are not at Dax upon the trysting day . `` The archers had spread themselves over the ruins , but a blast upon a bugle brought them all back to muster , with such booty as they could bear with them stuffed into their pouches or slung over their shoulders . As they formed into ranks , each man dropping silently into his place , Sir Nigel ran a questioning eye over them , and a smile of pleasure played over his face . Tall and sinewy , and brown , clear-eyed , hard-featured , with the stern and prompt bearing of experienced soldiers , it would be hard indeed for a leader to seek for a choicer following . Here and there in the ranks were old soldiers of the French wars , grizzled and lean , with fierce , puckered features and shaggy , bristling brows . The most , however , were young and dandy archers , with fresh English faces , their beards combed out , their hair curling from under their close steel hufkens , with gold or jewelled earrings gleaming in their ears , while their gold-spangled baldrics , their silken belts , and the chains which many of them wore round their thick brown necks , all spoke of the brave times which they had had as free companions . Each had a yew or hazel stave slung over his shoulder , plain and serviceable with the older men , but gaudily painted and carved at either end with the others . Steel caps , mail brigandines , white surcoats with the red lion of St. George , and sword or battle-axe swinging from their belts , completed this equipment , while in some cases the murderous maule or five-foot mallet was hung across the bowstave , being fastened to their leathern shoulder-belt by a hook in the centre of the handle . Sir Nigel 's heart beat high as he looked upon their free bearing and fearless faces.For two hours they marched through forest and marshland , along the left bank of the river Aveyron ; Sir Nigel riding behind his Company , with Alleyne at his right hand , and Johnston , the old master bowman , walking by his left stirrup . Ere they had reached their journey 's end the knight had learned all that he would know of his men , their doings and their intentions . Once , as they marched , they saw upon the further bank of the river a body of French men-at-arms , riding very swiftly in the direction of Villefranche . `` It is the Seneschal of Toulouse , with his following , '' said Johnston , shading his eyes with his hand . `` Had he been on this side of the water he might have attempted something upon us . `` `` I think that it would be well that we should cross , '' said Sir Nigel . `` It were pity to balk this worthy seneschal , should he desire to try some small feat of arms . `` `` Nay , there is no ford nearer than Tourville , '' answered the old archer . `` He is on his way to Villefranche , and short will be the shrift of any Jacks who come into his hands , for he is a man of short speech . It was he and the Seneschal of Beaucaire who hung Peter Wilkins , of the Company , last Lammastide ; for which , by the black rood of Waltham ! they shall hang themselves , if ever they come into our power . But here are our comrades , Sir Nigel , and here is our camp . `` As he spoke , the forest pathway along which they marched opened out into a green glade , which sloped down towards the river . High , leafless trees girt it in on three sides , with a thick undergrowth of holly between their trunks . At the farther end of this forest clearing there stood forty or fifty huts , built very neatly from wood and clay , with the blue smoke curling out from the roofs . A dozen tethered horses and mules grazed around the encampment , while a number of archers lounged about : some shooting at marks , while others built up great wooden fires in the open , and hung their cooking kettles above them . At the sight of their returning comrades there was a shout of welcome , and a horseman , who had been exercising his charger behind the camp , came cantering down to them . He was a dapper , brisk man , very richly clad , with a round , clean-shaven face , and very bright black eyes , which danced and sparkled with excitement . `` Sir Nigel ! '' he cried . `` Sir Nigel Loring , at last ! By my soul we have awaited you this month past . Right welcome , Sir Nigel ! You have had my letter ? `` `` It was that which brought me here , '' said Sir Nigel . `` But indeed , Sir Claude Latour , it is a great wonder to me that you did not yourself lead these bowmen , for surely they could have found no better leader ? `` `` None , none , by the Virgin of L'Esparre ! '' he cried , speaking in the strange , thick Gascon speech which turns everyv* into ab* . `` But you know what these islanders of yours are , Sir Nigel . They will not be led by any save their own blood and race . There is no persuading them . Not even I , Claude Latour Seigneur of Montchateau , master of the high justice , the middle and the low , could gain their favor . They must needs hold a council and put
