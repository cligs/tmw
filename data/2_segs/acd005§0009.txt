at his elbow , and his talk a hissing and an abomination . He has beaten old Pierre of the warehouse. '' '' Ha ! `` `` And thrust me into the cellar. '' '' Ha ! `` `` Because I have dragged him back when in his drunken love he would have thrown his arms about your cousin Adele. '' '' Oh ! '' The young man 's colour had been rising and his brows knitted at each successive charge , but at this last his anger boiled over , and he hurried forward with fury in his face , dragging his elderly companion by the elbow . They had been passing through one of those winding paths , bordered by high hedges , which thinned away every here and there to give a glimpse of some prowling faun or weary nymph who slumbered in marble amid the foliage . The few courtiers who met them gazed with surprise at so ill-assorted a pair of companions . But the young soldier was too full of his own plans to waste a thought upon their speculations . Still hurrying on , he followed a crescent path which led past a dozen stone dolphins shooting water out of their mouths over a group of Tritons , and so through an avenue of great trees which looked as if they had grown there for centuries , and yet had in truth been carried over that very year by incredible labour from St. Germain and Fontainebleau . Beyond this point a small gate led out of the grounds , and it was through it that the two passed , the elder man puffing and panting with this unusual haste . `` How did you come , uncle ? `` `` In a caleche . `` `` Where is it ? `` `` That is it , beyond the auberge . `` `` Come , let us make for it . `` `` And you , Amory , are you coming ? `` `` My faith , it is time that I came , from what you tell me . There is room for a man with a sword at his side in this establishment of yours . `` `` But what would you do ? `` `` I would have a word with this Captain Dalbert . `` `` Then I have wronged you , nephew , when I said even now that you were not whole-hearted towards Israel . `` `` I know not about Israel , '' cried De Catinat impatiently . `` I only know that if my Adele chose to worship the thunder like an Abenaqui squaw , or turned her innocent prayers to the Mitche Manitou , I should like to set eyes upon the man who would dare to lay a hand upon her . Ha , here comes our caleche ! Whip up , driver , and five livres to you if you pass the gate of the Invalides within the hour . `` It was no light matter to drive fast in an age of springless carriages and deeply rutted roads , but the driver lashed at his two rough unclipped horses , and the caleche jolted and clattered upon its way . As they sped on , with the road-side trees dancing past the narrow windows , and the white dust streaming behind them , the guardsman drummed his fingers upon his knees , and fidgeted in his seat with impatience , shooting an occasional question across at his grim companion . `` When was all this , then ? `` `` It was yesterday night . `` `` And where is Adele now ? `` `` She is at home . `` `` And this Dalbert ? `` `` Oh , he is there also ! '' '' What ! you have left her in his power while you came away toVersailles ? `` `` She is locked in her room. '' '' Pah ! what is a lock ? '' The young man raved with his hands in the air at the thought of his own impotence . `` And Pierre is there ? `` `` He is useless . `` `` And Amos Green . `` `` Ah , that is better . He is a man , by the look of him . `` `` His mother was one of our own folk from Staten Island , near Manhattan . She was one of those scattered lambs who fled early before the wolves , when first it was seen that the king 's hand waxed heavy upon Israel . He speaks French , and yet he is neither French to the eye , nor are his ways like our ways . `` `` He has chosen an evil time for his visit . `` `` Some wise purpose may lie hid in it . `` `` And you have left him in the house ? `` `` Yes ; he was sat with this Dalbert , smoking with him , and telling him strange tales . `` `` What guard could he be ? He is a stranger in a strange land . You did ill to leave Adele thus , uncle . `` `` She is in God 's hands , Amory . `` `` I trust so . Oh , I am on fire to be there ! `` He thrust his head through the cloud of dust which rose from the wheels , and craned his neck to look upon the long curving river and broad-spread city , which was already visible before them , half hid by a thin blue haze , through which shot the double tower of Notre Dame , with the high spire of St. Jacques and a forest of other steeples and minarets , the monuments of eight hundred years of devotion . Soon , as the road curved down to the river-bank , the city wall grew nearer and nearer , until they had passed the southern gate , and were rattling over the stony causeway , leaving the broad Luxembourg upon their right , and Colbert 's last work , the Invalides , upon their left . A sharp turn brought them on to the river quays , and crossing over the Pont Neuf , they skirted the stately Louvre , and plunged into the labyrinth of narrow but important streets which extended to the northward . The young officer had his head still thrust out of the window , but his view was obscured by a broad gilded carriage which lumbered heavily along in front of them . As the road broadened , however , it swerved to one side , and he was able to catch a glimpse of the house to which they were making.It was surrounded on every side by an immense crowd.The house of the Huguenot merchant was a tall , narrow building standing at the corner of the Rue St. Martin and the Rue de Biron . It was four stories in height , grim and grave like its owner , with high peaked roof , long diamond-paned windows , a frame-work of black wood , with gray plaster filling the interstices , and five stone steps which led up to the narrow and sombre door . The upper story was but a warehouse in which the trader kept his stock , but the second and third were furnished with balconies edged with stout wooden balustrades . As the uncle and the nephew sprang out of the caleche , they found themselves upon the outskirts of a dense crowd of people , who were swaying and tossing with excitement , their chins all thrown forwards and their gaze directed upwards . Following their eyes , the young officer saw a sight which left him standing bereft of every sensation save amazement.From the upper balcony there was hanging head downwards a man clad in the bright blue coat and white breeches of one of the king 's dragoons . His hat and wig had dropped off , and his close-cropped head swung slowly backwards and forwards a good fifty feet above the pavement . His face was turned towards the street , and was of a deadly whiteness , while his eyes were screwed up as though he dared not open them upon the horror which faced them . His voice , however , resounded over the whole place until the air was filled with his screams for mercy.Above him , at the corner of the balcony , there stood a young man who leaned with a bent back over the balustrades , and who held the dangling dragoon by either ankle . His face , however , was not directed towards his victim , but was half turned over his shoulder to confront a group of soldiers who were clustering at the long , open window which led out into the balcony . His head , as he glanced at them , was poised with a proud air of defiance , while they surged and oscillated in the opening , uncertain whether to rush on or to retire.Suddenly the crowd gave a groan of excitement . The young man had released his grip upon one of the ankles , and the dragoon hung now by one only , his other leg flapping helplessly in the air . He grabbed aimlessly with his hands at the wall and the wood-work behind him , still yelling at the pitch of his lungs . `` Pull me up , son of the devil , pull me up ! '' he screamed . `` Would you murder me , then ? Help , good people , help ! `` `` Do you want to come up , captain ? '' said the strong clear voice of the young man above him , speaking excellent French , but in an accent which fell strangely upon the ears of the crowd beneath . `` Yes , sacred name of God , yes ! `` `` Order off your men , then . `` `` Away , you dolts , you imbeciles ! Do you wish to see me dashed to pieces ? Away , I say ! Off with you ! `` `` That is better , '' said the youth , when the soldiers had vanished from the window . He gave a tug at the dragoon 's leg as he spoke , which jerked him up so far that he could twist round and catch hold of the lower edge of the balcony . `` How do you find yourself now ? '' he asked . `` Hold me , for heaven 's sake , hold me ! `` `` I have you quite secure . `` `` Then pull me up ! `` `` Not so fast , captain . You can talk very well where you are . `` `` Let me up , sir , let me up ! `` `` All in good time . I fear that it is inconvenient to you to talk with your heels in the air . `` `` Ah , you would murder me ! `` `` On the contrary , I am going to pull you up . `` `` Heaven bless you ! `` `` But only on conditions . `` `` Oh , they are granted ! I am slipping ! `` `` You will leave this house -- -you and your men . You will not trouble this old man or this young girl any further . Do you promise ? `` `` Oh yes ; we shall go . `` `` Word of honour ? '' '' Certainly . Only pull me up ! `` `` Not so fast . It may be easier to talk to you like this . I do
