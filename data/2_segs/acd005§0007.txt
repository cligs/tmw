himself , he had at least the merit that he insisted upon being the only one within his kingdom . He was about to resume his way again , when an elderly man , clad in the garb of a respectable citizen , and with a strong deep-lined face which marked him as a man of character , darted forward , and threw himself down upon one knee in front of the monarch . `` Justice , sire , justice ! '' he cried . `` What is this , then ? '' asked Louis . `` Who are you , and what is it that you want ? `` `` I am a citizen of Paris , and I have been cruelly wronged . `` `` You seem a very worthy person . If you have indeed been wronged you shall have redress . What have you to complain of ? `` `` Twenty of the Blue Dragoons of Languedoc are quartered in my house , with Captain Dalbert at their head . They have devoured my food , stolen my property , and beaten my servants , yet the magistrates will give me no redress . ' '' On my life , justice seems to be administered in a strange fashion in our city of Paris ! '' exclaimed the king wrathfully . `` It is indeed a shameful case , '' said Bossuet . `` And yet there may be a very good reason for it , '' suggested Pere la Chaise . `` I would suggest that your Majesty should ask this man his name , his business , and why it was that the dragoons were quartered upon him . `` `` You hear the reverend father 's question . `` `` My name , sire , is Catinat , by trade I am a merchant in cloth , and I am treated in this fashion because I am of the Reformed Church . `` `` I thought as much ! '' cried the confessor . `` That alters matters , '' said Bossuet.The king shook his head and his brow darkened . `` You have only yourself to thank , then . The remedy is in your hands . `` `` And how , sire ? `` `` By embracing the only true faith . `` `` I am already a member of it , sire . `` The king stamped his foot angrily . `` I can see that you are a very insolent heretic , '' said he . `` There is but one Church in France , and that is my Church . If you are outside that , you can not look to me for aid . `` `` My creed is that of my father , sire , and of my grandfather . `` `` If they have sinned it is no reason why you should . My own grandfather erred also before his eyes were opened . `` `` But he nobly atoned for his error , '' murmured the Jesuit . `` Then you will not help me , sire ? `` `` You must first help yourself . `` The old Huguenot stood up with a gesture of despair , while the king continued on his way , the two ecclesiastics , on either side of him , murmuring their approval into his ears . `` You have done nobly , sire . `` `` You are truly the first son of the Church . `` `` You are the worthy successor of St . Louis . `` But the king bore the face of a man who was not absolutely satisfied with his own action . `` You do not think , then , that these people have too hard a measure ? '' said he . `` Too hard ? Nay , your Majesty errs on the side of mercy . `` `` I hear that they are leaving my kingdom in great numbers . `` `` And surely it is better so , sire ; for what blessing can come upon a country which has such stubborn infidels within its boundaries ? `` `` Those who are traitors to God can scarce be loyal to the king , '' remarked Bossuet . `` Your Majesty 's power would be greater if there were no temple , as they call their dens of heresy , within your dominions . `` `` My grandfather promised them protection . They are shielded , as you well know , by the edict which be gave at Nantes . `` `` But it lies with your Majesty to undo the mischief that has been done . `` `` And how ? `` `` By recalling the edict . `` `` And driving into the open arms of my enemies two millions of my best artisans and of my bravest servants . No , no , father , I have , I trust , every zeal for Mother-Church , but there is some truth in what De Frontenac said this morning of the evil which comes from mixing the affairs of this world with those of the next . How say you , Louvois ? `` `` With all respect to the Church , sire , I would say that the devil has given these men such cunning of hand and of brain that they are the best workers and traders in your Majesty 's kingdom . I know not how the state coffers are to be filled if such tax-payers go from among us . Already many have left the country and taken their trades with them . If all were to go , it would be worse for us than a lost campaign . `` `` But , '' remarked Bossuet , `` if it were once known that the king 's will had been expressed , your Majesty may rest assured that even the worst of his subjects bear him such love that they would hasten to come within the pale of Holy Church . As long as the edict stands , it seems to them that the king is lukewarm , and that they may abide in their error . `` The king shook his head . `` They have always been stubborn folk , '' said he . `` Perhaps , '' remarked Louvois , glancing maliciously at Bossuet , `` were the bishops of France to make an offering to the state of the treasures of their sees , we might then do without these Huguenot taxes . `` `` All that the Church has is at the king 's service , '' answered Bossuet curtly . `` The kingdom is mine and all that is in it , '' remarked Louis , as they entered theGrand Salon , in which the court assembled after chapel , `` yet I trust that it may be long before I have to claim the wealth of the Church . `` `` We trust so , sire , '' echoed the ecclesiastics . `` But we may reserve such topics for our council-chamber . Where is Mansard ? I must see his plans for the new wing at Marly . '' He crossed to a side table , and was buried in an instant in his favourite pursuit , inspecting the gigantic plans of the great architect , and inquiring eagerly as to the progress of the work . `` I think , '' said Pere la Chaise , drawing Bossuet aside , `` that your Grace has made some impression upon the king 's mind . `` `` With your powerful assistance , father . `` `` Oh , you may rest assured that I shall lose no opportunity of pushing on the good work . `` `` If you take it in hand , it is done . `` `` But there is another who has more weight than I . `` `` The favourite , De Montespan ? `` `` No , no ; her day is gone . It is Madame de Maintenon . `` `` I hear that she is very devout. '' '' Very . But she has no love for my Order . She is a Sulpitian . Yet we may all work to one end . Now if you were to speak to her , your Grace . `` `` With all my heart . `` `` Show her how good a service it would be could she bring about the banishment of the Huguenots . `` `` I shall do so . `` `` And offer her in return that we will promote -- - '' he bent forward and whispered into the prelate 's ear. '' What ! He would not do it ! `` `` And why ? The queen is dead . `` `` The widow of the poet Scarron ! `` `` She is of good birth . Her grandfather and his were dear friends . `` `` It is impossible . `` `` But I know his heart , and I say it is possible . `` `` You certainly know his heart , father , if any can . But such a thought had never entered my head . `` `` Then let it enter and remain there . If she will serve the Church , theChurch will serve her . But the king beckons , and I must go . `` The thin dark figure hastened off through the throng of courtiers , and the great Bishop of Meaux remained standing with his chin upon his breast , sunk in reflection.By this time all the court was assembled in theGrand Salon , and the huge room was gay from end to end with the silks , the velvets , and the brocades of the ladies , the glitter of jewels , the flirt of painted fans , and the sweep of plume or aigrette . The grays , blacks , and browns of the men 's coats toned down the mass of colour , for all must be dark when the king was dark , and only the blues of the officers ' uniforms , and the pearl and gray of the musketeers of the guard , remained to call back those early days of the reign when the men had vied with the women in the costliness and brilliancy of their wardrobes . And if dresses had changed , manners had done so even more . The old levity and the old passions lay doubtless very near the surface , but grave faces and serious talk were the fashion of the hour . It was no longer the luckycoupat the lansquenet table , the last comedy of Moliere , or the new opera of Lully about which they gossiped , but it was on the evils of Jansenism , on the expulsion of Arnauld from the Sorbonne , on the insolence of Pascal , or on the comparative merits of two such popular preachers as Bourdaloue and Massilon . So , under a radiant ceiling and over a many-coloured floor , surrounded by immortal paintings , set thickly in gold and ornament , there moved these nobles and ladies of France , all moulding themselves upon the one little dark figure in their midst , who was himself so far from being his own master that he hung balanced even now between two rival women , who were playing a game in which the future of France and his own destiny were the stakes.The elderly Huguenot had stood silent after his repulse by the king , with his eyes cast moodily downwards , and a face in which doubt , sorrow , and anger contended for the mastery . He was a very large , gaunt man , raw-boned and haggard , with a wide forehead , a large
