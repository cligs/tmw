Orfevre . Unless I have some luck at lansquenet , I shall have to come out soon and join you . ' Hem ! I did you an injustice , Louvois . I see that you havenotlooked over these letters . `` The minister had sat with a face which was the colour of beetroot , and eyes which projected from his head , while this epistle was being read . It was with relief that he came to the end of it , for at least there was nothing which compromised him seriously with the king ; but every nerve in his great body tingled with rage as he thought of the way in which his young scape-grace had alluded to him . `` The viper ! '' he cried . `` Oh , the foul snake in the grass ! I will make him curse the day that he was born . `` `` Tut , tut , Louvois ! '' said the king . `` You are a man who has seen much of life , and you should be a philosopher . Hot-headed youth says ever more than it means . Think no more of the matter . But what have we here ? A letter from my dearest girl to her husband , the Prince de Conti . I would pick her writing out of a thousand . Ah , dear soul , she little thought that my eyes would see her artless prattle ! Why should I read it , since I already know every thought of her innocent heart ? '' He unfolded the sheet of pink scented paper with a fond smile upon his face , but it faded away as his eyes glanced down the page , and he sprang to his feet with a snarl of anger , his hand over his heart and his eyes still glued to the paper . `` Minx ! '' he cried , in a choking voice . `` Impertinent , heartless minx ! Louvois , you know what I have done for the princess . You know she has been the apple of my eye . What have I ever grudged her ? What have I ever denied her ? `` `` You have been goodness itself , sire , '' said Louvois , whose own wounds smarted less now that he saw his master writhing . `` Hear what she says of me : 'Old Father Grumpy is much as usual , save that he gives a little at the knees . You remember how we used to laugh at his airs and graces ! Well , he has given up all that , and though he still struts about on great high heels , like a Landes peasant on his stilts , he has no brightness at all in his clothes . Of course , all the court follow his example , so you can imagine what a nightmare place this is . Then this woman still keeps in favour , and her frocks are as dismal as Grumpy 's coats ; so when you come back we shall go into the country together , and you shall dress in red velvet , and I shall wear blue silk , and we shall have a little coloured court of our own in spite of my majestic papa . ' '' Louis sank his face in his hands . `` You hear how she speaks of me , Louvois . `` `` It is infamous , sire ; infamous ! `` `` She calls me names -- -*me* , Louvois ! `` `` Atrocious , sire . `` `` And my knees ! one would think that I was an old man ! '' '' Scandalous . But , sire , I would beg to say that it is a case in which your Majesty 's philosophy may well soften your anger . Youth is ever hot-headed , and says more than it means . Think no more of the matter . `` `` You speak like a fool , Louvois . The child that I have loved turns upon me , and you ask me to think no more of it . Ah , it is one more lesson that a king can trust least of all those who have his own blood in their veins . What writing is this ? It is the good Cardinal de Bouillon . One may not have faith in one 's own kin , but this sainted man loves me , not only because I have placed him where he is , but because it is his nature to look up to and love those whom God has placed above him . I will read you his letter , Louvois , to show you that there is still such a thing as loyalty and gratitude in France . 'My dear Prince de la Roche-sur-Yon . ' Ah , it is to him he writes . 'I promised when you left that I would let you know from time to time how things were going at court , as you consulted me about bringing your daughter up from Anjou , in the hope that she might catch the king 's fancy . ' What ! What ! Louvois ! What villainy is this ? 'The sultan goes from bad to worse . The Fontanges was at least the prettiest woman in France , though between ourselves there was just a shade too much of the red in her hair -- -an excellent colour in a cardinal 's gown , my dear duke , but nothing brighter than chestnut is permissible in a lady . The Montespan , too , was a fine woman in her day , but fancy his picking up now with a widow who is older than himself , a woman , too , who does not even try to make herself attractive , but kneels at herprie-dieuor works at her tapestry from morning to night . They say that December and May make a bad match , but my own opinion is that two Novembers make an even worse one . ' Louvois ! Louvois ! I can read no more ! Have you alettre de cachet ? `` `` There is one here , sire . `` `` For the Bastille ? `` `` No ; for Vincennes . `` `` That will do very well . Fill it up , Louvois ! Put this villain 's name in it ! Let him be arrested to-night , and taken there in his own caleche . The shameless , ungrateful , foul-mouthed villain ! Why did you bring me these letters , Louvois ? Oh , why did you yield to my foolish whim ? My God , is there no truth , or honour , or loyalty in the world ? '' He stamped his feet , and shook his clenched hands in the air in the frenzy of his anger and disappointment . `` Shall I , then , put back the others ? '' asked Louvois eagerly . He had been on thorns since the king had begun to read them , not knowing what disclosures might come next . `` Put them back , but keep the bag . `` `` Both bags ? '' '' Ah ! I had forgot the other one . Perhaps if I have hypocrites around me , I have at least some honest subjects at a distance . Let us take one haphazard . Who is this from ? Ah ! it is from the Duc de la Rochefoucauld . He has ever seemed to be a modest and dutiful young man . What has he to say ? The Danube -- -Belgrade -- -the grand vizier -- -Ah ! '' He gave a cry as if he had been stabbed . `` What , then , sire ? '' The minister had taken a step forward , for he was frightened by the expression upon the king 's face . `` Take them away , Louvois ! Take them away ! '' he cried , pushing the pile of papers away from him . `` I would that I had never seen them ! I will look at them no more ! He gibes even at my courage , I who was in the trenches when he was in his cradle ! 'This war would not suit the king , ' he says . 'For there are battles , and none of the nice little safe sieges which are so dear to him . ' By God , he shall pay to me with his head for that jest ! Ay , Louvois , it will be a dear gibe to him . But take them away . I have seen as much as I can bear . `` The minister was thrusting them back into the bag when suddenly his eye caught the bold , clear writing of Madame de Maintenon upon one of the letters . Some demon whispered to him that here was a weapon which had been placed in his hands , with which he might strike one whose very name filled him with jealousy and hatred . Had she been guilty of some indiscretion in this note , then he might even now , at this last hour , turn the king 's heart against her . He was an astute man , and in an instant he had seen his chance and grasped it. '' Ha ! '' said he , `` it was hardly necessary to open this one . `` `` Which , Louvois ? Whose is it ? `` The minister pushed forward the letter , and Louis started as his eyes fell upon it . `` Madame 's writing ! '' he gasped . `` Yes ; it is to her nephew in Germany . `` Louis took it in his hand . Then , with a sudden motion , he threw it down among the others , and then yet again his hand stole towards it . His face was gray and haggard , and beads of moisture had broken out upon his brow . If this too were to prove to be as the others ! He was shaken to the soul at the very thought . Twice he tried to pluck it out , and twice his trembling fingers fumbled with the paper . Then he tossed it over to Louvois . `` Read it to me , '' said he.The minister opened the letter out and flattened it upon the table , with a malicious light dancing in his eyes , which might have cost him his position had the king but read it aright . `` 'My dear nephew , ' '' he read , `` 'what you ask me in your last is absolutely impossible . I have never abused the king 's favour so far as to ask for any profit for myself , and I should be equally sorry to solicit any advance for my relatives . No one would rejoice more than I to see you rise to be major in your regiment , but your valour and your loyalty must be the cause , and you must not hope to do it through any word of mine . To serve such a man as the king is its own reward , and I am sure that whether you remain a cornet or rise to some higher rank , you will be equally zealous in his cause . He is surrounded , unhappily , by many base parasites . Some of these are mere fools , like Lauzun ; others are knaves , like the late Fouquet ; and some seem to be both fools and knaves , like Louvois ,
