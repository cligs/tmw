of dense masses of slingers and of crossbowmen , who drilled and marched in the spaces which had been left for their exercise . A thousand columns of smoke reeked up into the pure morning air where the faggots were piled and the camp-kettles already simmering . In the open plain clouds of light horse galloped and swooped with swaying bodies and waving javelins , after the fashion which the Spanish had adopted from their Moorish enemies . All along by the sedgy banks of the rivers long lines of pages led their masters ' chargers down to water , while the knights themselves lounged in gayly-dressed groups about the doors of their pavilions , or rode out , with their falcons upon their wrists and their greyhounds behind them , in quest of quail or of leveret . `` By my hilt ! mon gar. ! '' whispered Aylward to Alleyne , as the young squire stood with parted lips and wondering eyes , gazing down at the novel scene before him , `` we have been seeking them all night , but now that we have found them I know not what we are to do with them . `` `` You say sooth , Samkin , '' quoth old Johnston . `` I would that we were upon the far side of Ebro again , for there is neither honor nor profit to be gained here . What say you , Simon ? `` `` By the rood ! '' cried the fierce man-at-arms , `` I will see the color of their blood ere I turn my mare 's head for the mountains . Am I a child , that I should ride for three days and nought but words at the end of it ? `` `` Well said , my sweet honeysuckle ! '' cried Hordle John . `` I am with you , like hilt to blade . Could I but lay hands upon one of those gay prancers yonder , I doubt not that I should have ransom enough from him to buy my mother a new cow . `` `` A cow ! '' said Aylward . `` Say rather ten acres and a homestead on the banks of Avon . `` `` Say you so ? Then , by our Lady ! here is for yonder one in the red jerkin ! `` He was about to push recklessly forward into the open , when Sir Nigel himself darted in front of him , with his hand upon his breast. '' Back ! '' said he . `` Our time is not yet come , and we must lie here until evening . Throw off your jacks and headpieces , least their eyes catch the shine , and tether the horses among the rocks . `` The order was swiftly obeyed , and in ten minutes the archers were stretched along by the side of the brook , munching the bread and the bacon which they had brought in their bags , and craning their necks to watch the ever-changing scene beneath them . Very quiet and still they lay , save for a muttered jest or whispered order , for twice during the long morning they heard bugle-calls from amid the hills on either side of them , which showed that they had thrust themselves in between the outposts of the enemy . The leaders sat amongst the box-wood , and took counsel together as to what they should do ; while from below there surged up the buzz of voices , the shouting , the neighing of horses , and all the uproar of a great camp . `` What boots it to wait ? '' said Sir William Felton . `` Let us ride down upon their camp ere they discover us . `` `` And so say I , '' cried the Scottish earl ; `` for they do not know that there is any enemy within thirty long leagues of them . `` `` For my part , '' said Sir Simon Burley , `` I think that it is madness , for you can not hope to rout this great army ; and where are you to go and what are you to do when they have turned upon you ? How say you , Sir Oliver Buttesthorn ? `` `` By the apple of Eve ! '' cried the fat knight , `` it appears to me that this wind brings a very savory smell of garlic and of onions from their cooking-kettles . I am in favor of riding down upon them at once , if my old friend and comrade here is of the same mind . `` `` Nay , '' said Sir Nigel , `` I have a plan by which we may attempt some small deed upon them , and yet , by the help of God , may be able to draw off again ; which , as Sir Simon Burley hath said , would be scarce possible in any other way . `` `` How then , Sir Nigel ? '' asked several voices . `` We shall lie here all day ; for amid this brushwood it is ill for them to see us . Then when evening comes we shall sally out upon them and see if we may not gain some honorable advancement from them . `` `` But why then rather than now ? `` `` Because we shall have nightfall to cover us when we draw off , so that we may make our way back through the mountains . I would station a score of archers here in the pass , with all our pennons jutting forth from the rocks , and as many nakirs and drums and bugles as we have with us , so that those who follow us in the fading light may think that the whole army of the prince is upon them , and fear to go further . What think you of my plan , Sir Simon ? `` `` By my troth ! I think very well of it , '' cried the prudent old commander . `` If four hundred men must needs run a tilt against sixty thousand , I can not see how they can do it better or more safely . `` `` And so say I , '' cried Felton , heartily . `` But I wish the day were over , for it will be an ill thing for us if they chance to light upon us . `` The words were scarce out of his mouth when there came a clatter of loose stones , the sharp clink of trotting hoofs , and a dark-faced cavalier , mounted upon a white horse , burst through the bushes and rode swiftly down the valley from the end which was farthest from the Spanish camp . Lightly armed , with his vizor open and a hawk perched upon his left wrist , he looked about him with the careless air of a man who is bent wholly upon pleasure , and unconscious of the possibility of danger . Suddenly , however , his eyes lit upon the fierce faces which glared out at him from the brushwood . With a cry of terror , he thrust his spurs into his horse 's sides and dashed for the narrow opening of the gorge . For a moment it seemed as though he would have reached it , for he had trampled over or dashed aside the archers who threw themselves in his way ; but Hordle John seized him by the foot in his grasp of iron and dragged him from the saddle , while two others caught the frightened horse . `` Ho , ho ! '' roared the great archer . `` How many cows wilt buy my mother , if I set thee free ? `` `` Hush that bull 's bellowing ! '' cried Sir Nigel impatiently . `` Bring the man here . By St. Paul ! it is not the first time that we have met ; for , if I mistake not , it is Don Diego Alvarez , who was once at the prince 's court . `` `` It is indeed I , '' said the Spanish knight , speaking in the French tongue , `` and I pray you to pass your sword through my heart , for how can I live -- -I , a caballero of Castile -- -after being dragged from my horse by the base hands of a common archer ? `` `` Fret not for that , '' answered Sir Nigel . `` For , in sooth , had he not pulled you down , a dozen cloth-yard shafts had crossed each other in your body . `` `` By St. James ! it were better so than to be polluted by his touch , '' answered the Spaniard , with his black eyes sparkling with rage and hatred . `` I trust that I am now the prisoner of some honorable knight or gentleman . `` `` You are the prisoner of the man who took you , Sir Diego , '' answered Sir Nigel . `` And I may tell you that better men than either you or I have found themselves before now prisoners in the hands of archers of England . `` `` What ransom , then , does he demand ? '' asked the Spaniard.Big John scratched his red head and grinned in high delight when the question was propounded to him . `` Tell him , '' said he , `` that I shall have ten cows and a bull too , if it be but a little one . Also a dress of blue sendall for mother and a red one for Joan ; with five acres of pasture-land , two scythes , and a fine new grindstone . Likewise a small house , with stalls for the cows , and thirty-six gallons of beer for the thirsty weather . `` `` Tut , tut ! '' cried Sir Nigel , laughing . `` All these things may be had for money ; and I think , Don Diego , that five thousand crowns is not too much for so renowned a knight . `` `` It shall be duly paid him . `` `` For some days we must keep you with us ; and I must crave leave also to use your shield , your armor , and your horse . `` `` My harness is yours by the law of arms , '' said the Spaniard , gloomily . `` I do but ask the loan of it . I have need of it this day , but it shall be duly returned to you . Set guards , Aylward , with arrow on string , at either end of the pass ; for it may happen that some other cavaliers may visit us ere the time be come . '' All day the little band of Englishmen lay in the sheltered gorge , looking down upon the vast host of their unconscious enemies . Shortly after mid-day , a great uproar of shouting and cheering broke out in the camp , with mustering of men and calling of bugles . Clambering up among the rocks , the companions saw a long rolling cloud of dust along the whole eastern sky-line , with the glint of spears and the flutter of pennons , which announced the approach of a large body of cavalry . For a moment a wild hope came upon them that perhaps the prince had moved more swiftly than had been planned , that he had crossed the Ebro , and that this was his vanguard sweeping to the attack .
