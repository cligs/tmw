to think that I really had you to myself after all these years , with none to come between . Ah , little wifie , I have often longed for this hour . `` `` I have wronged you , Maurice ; I have wronged you ! Forgive me ! `` `` We do not forgive in our family , my darling Francoise . Is it not like old days to find ourselves driving together ? And in this carriage , too . It is the very one which bore us back from the cathedral where you made your vows so prettily . I sat as I sit now , and you sat there , and I took your hand like this , and I pressed it , and -- - '' '' Oh , villain , you have twisted my wrist ! You have broken my arm ! `` `` Oh , surely not , my little wifie ! And then you remember that , as you told me how truly you would love me , I leaned forward to your lips , and -- - '' '' Oh , help ! Brute , you have cut my mouth ! You have struck me with your ring . `` `` Struck you ! Now who would have thought that spring day when we planned out our future , that this also was in the future waiting for me and you ? And this ! and this ! `` He struck savagely at her face in the darkness . She threw herself down , her head pressed against the cushions . With the strength and fury of a maniac he showered his blows above her , thudding upon the leather or crashing upon the woodwork , heedless of his own splintered hands . `` So I have silenced you , '' said he at last . `` I have stopped your words with my kisses before now . But the world goes on , Francoise , and times change , and women grow false , and men grow stern . `` `` You may kill me if you will , '' she moaned . `` I will , '' he said simply.Still the carriage flew along , jolting and staggering in the deeply-rutted country roads . The storm had passed , but the growl of the thunder and the far-off glint of a lightning-flash were to be heard and seen on the other side of the heavens . The moon shone out with its clear cold light , silvering the broad , hedgeless , poplar-fringed plains , and shining through the window of the carriage upon the crouching figure and her terrible companion . He leaned back now , his arms folded upon his chest , his eyes gloating upon the abject misery of the woman who had wronged him . `` Where are you taking me ? '' she asked at last . `` To Portillac , my little wifie . `` `` And why there ? What would you do to me ? `` `` I would silence that little lying tongue forever . It shall deceive no more men . `` `` You would murder me ? `` `` If you call it that . `` `` You have a stone for a heart . `` `` My other was given to a woman . `` `` Oh , my sins are indeed punished . `` `` Rest assured that they will be . `` `` Can I do nothing to atone ? `` `` I will see that you atone . `` `` You have a sword by your side , Maurice . Why do you not kill me , then , if you are so bitter against me ? Why do you not pass it through my heart ? `` `` Rest assured that I would have done so had I not an excellent reason . `` `` Why , then ? `` `` I will tell you . At Portillac I have the right of the high justice , the middle , and the low . I am seigneur there , and can try , condemn , and execute . It is my lawful privilege . This pitiful king will not even know how to avenge you , for the right is mine , and he can not gainsay it without making an enemy of every seigneur in France . `` He opened his mouth again and laughed at his own device , while she , shivering in every limb , turned away from his cruel face and glowing eyes , and buried her face in her hands . Once more she prayed God to forgive her for her poor sinful life . So they whirled through the night behind the clattering horses , the husband and the wife , saying nothing , but with hatred and fear raging in their hearts , until a brazier fire shone down upon them from the angle of a keep , and the shadow of the huge pile loomed vaguely up in front of them in the darkness . It was the Castle of Portillac.And thus it was that Amory de Catinat and Amos Green saw from their dungeon window the midnight carriage which discharged its prisoner before their eyes . Hence , too , came that ominous planking and that strange procession in the early morning . And thus it also happened that they found themselves looking down upon Francoise de Montespan as she was led to her death , and that they heard that last piteous cry for aid at the instant when the heavy hand of the ruffian with the axe fell upon her shoulder , and she was forced down upon her knees beside the block . She shrank screaming from the dreadful , red-stained , greasy billet of wood , but the butcher heaved up his weapon , and the seigneur had taken a step forward with hand outstretched to seize the long auburn hair and to drag the dainty head down with it when suddenly he was struck motionless with astonishment , and stood with his foot advanced and his hand still out , his mouth half open , and his eyes fixed in front of him.And , indeed , what he had seen was enough to fill any man with amazement . Out of the small square window which faced him a man had suddenly shot head-foremost , pitching on to his outstretched hands and then bounding to his feet . Within a foot of his heels came the head of a second one , who fell more heavily than the first , and yet recovered himself as quickly . The one wore the blue coat with silver facings of the king 's guard ; the second had the dark coat and clean-shaven face of a man of peace ; but each carried a short rusty iron bar in his hand . Not a word did either of them say , but the soldier took two quick steps forward and struck at the headsman while he was still poising himself for a blow at the victim . There was a thud , with a crackle like a breaking egg , and the bar flew into pieces . The heads-man gave a dreadful cry , and dropped his axe , clapped his two hands to his head , and running zigzag across the scaffold , fell over , a dead man , into the courtyard beneath.Quick as a flash De Catinat had caught up the axe , and faced De Montespan with the heavy weapon slung over his shoulder and a challenge in his eyes. '' Now ! '' said he.The seigneur had for the instant been too astounded to speak . Now he understood at least that these strangers had come between him and his prey . `` Seize these men ! '' he shrieked , turning to his followers . `` One moment ! '' cried De Catinat , with a voice and manner which commanded attention . `` You see by my coat what I am . I am the body-servant of the king . Who touches me touches him . Have a care for yourselves . It is a dangerous game ! `` `` On , you cowards ! '' roared De Montespan.But the men-at-arms hesitated , for the fear of the king was as a great shadow which hung over all France . De Catinat saw their indecision , and he followed up his advantage . `` This woman , '' he cried , `` is the king 's own favourite , and if any harm come to a lock of her hair , I tell you that there is not a living soul within this portcullis who will not die a death of torture . Fools , will you gasp out your lives upon the rack , or writhe in boiling oil , at the bidding of this madman ? `` `` Who are these men , Marceau ? '' cried the seigneur furiously . `` They are prisoners , your excellency. '' '' Prisoners ! Whose prisoners ? `` `` Yours , your excellency . `` `` Who ordered you to detain them ? `` `` You did . The escort brought your signet-ring . `` `` I never saw the men . There is devilry in this . But they shall not beard me in my own castle , nor stand between me and my own wife . No , par dieu ! they shall not and live ! You men , Marceau , Etienne , Gilbert , Jean , Pierre , all you who have eaten my bread , on to them , I say ! `` He glanced round with furious eyes , but they fell only upon hung heads and averted faces . With a hideous curse he flashed out his sword and rushed at his wife , who knelt half insensible beside the block . De Catinat sprang between them to protect her ; but Marceau , the bearded seneschal , had already seized his master round the waist . With the strength of a maniac , his teeth clenched and the foam churning from the corners of his lips , De Montespan writhed round in the man 's grasp , and shortening his sword , he thrust it through the brown beard and deep into the throat behind it . Marceau fell back with a choking cry , the blood bubbling from his mouth and his wound ; but before his murderer could disengage his weapon , De Catinat and the American , aided by a dozen of the retainers , had dragged him down on to the scaffold , and Amos Green had pinioned him so securely that he could but move his eyes and his lips , with which he lay glaring and spitting at them . So savage were his own followers against him -- -for Marceau was well loved amongst them -- - that , with axe and block so ready , justice might very swiftly have had her way , had not a long clear bugle-call , rising and falling in a thousand little twirls and flourishes , clanged out suddenly in the still morning air . De Catinat pricked up his ears at the sound of it like a hound at the huntsman 's call . `` Did you hear , Amos ? `` `` It was a trumpet . `` `` It was the guards ' bugle-call . You , there , hasten to the gate ! Throw up the portcullis and drop the drawbridge ! Stir yourselves , or even now you may suffer for your master 's sins ! It has been a narrow escape , Amos ! `` `` You may say so , friend . I saw
