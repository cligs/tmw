die one , '' said Summerlee sourly . `` And you , sir , have lived an unimaginative obstructionist and never can hope now to emerge from it . `` `` Your worst critics will never accuse you of lacking imagination , '' Summerlee retorted . `` Upon my word ! '' said Lord John . `` It would be like you if you used up our last gasp of oxygen in abusing each other . What can it matter whether folk come back or not ? It surely wo n't be in our time . `` `` In that remark , sir , you betray your own very pronounced limitations , '' said Challenger severely . `` The true scientific mind is not to be tied down by its own conditions of time and space . It builds itself an observatory erected upon the border line of present , which separates the infinite past from the infinite future . From this sure post it makes its sallies even to the beginning and to the end of all things . As to death , the scientific mind dies at its post working in normal and methodic fashion to the end . It disregards so petty a thing as its own physical dissolution as completely as it does all other limitations upon the plane of matter . Am I right , Professor Summerlee ? `` Summerlee grumbled an ungracious assent . `` With certain reservations , I agree , '' said he . `` The ideal scientific mind , '' continued Challenger -- - '' I put it in the third person rather than appear to be too self-complacent -- -the ideal scientific mind should be capable of thinking out a point of abstract knowledge in the interval between its owner falling from a balloon and reaching the earth . Men of this strong fibre are needed to form the conquerors of nature and the bodyguard of truth . `` `` It strikes me nature 's on top this time , '' said Lord John , looking out of the window . `` I 've read some leadin ' articles about you gentlemen controllin ' her , but she 's gettin ' a bit of her own back . `` `` It is but a temporary setback , '' said Challenger with conviction . `` A few million years , what are they in the great cycle of time ? The vegetable world has , as you can see , survived . Look at the leaves of that plane tree . The birds are dead , but the plant flourishes . From this vegetable life in pond and in marsh will come , in time , the tiny crawling microscopic slugs which are the pioneers of that great army of life in which for the instant we five have the extraordinary duty of serving as rear guard . Once the lowest form of life has established itself , the final advent of man is as certain as the growth of the oak from the acorn . The old circle will swing round once more . `` `` But the poison ? '' I asked . `` Will that not nip life in the bud ? `` `` The poison may be a mere stratum or layer in the ether -- -a mephitic Gulf Stream across that mighty ocean in which we float . Or tolerance may be established and life accommodate itself to a new condition . The mere fact that with a comparatively small hyperoxygenation of our blood we can hold out against it is surely a proof in itself that no very great change would be needed to enable animal life to endure it . `` The smoking house beyond the trees had burst into flames . We could see the high tongues of fire shooting up into the air . `` It 's pretty awful , '' muttered Lord John , more impressed than I had ever seen him . `` Well , after all , what does it matter ? '' I remarked . `` The world is dead . Cremation is surely the best burial . `` `` It would shorten us up if this house went ablaze . `` `` I foresaw the danger , '' said Challenger , `` and asked my wife to guard against it . `` `` Everything is quite safe , dear . But my head begins to throb again . What a dreadful atmosphere ! `` `` We must change it , '' said Challenger . He bent over his cylinder of oxygen . `` It 's nearly empty , '' said he . `` It has lasted us some three and a half hours . It is now close on eight o'clock . We shall get through the night comfortably . I should expect the end about nine o'clock to-morrow morning . We shall see one sunrise , which shall be all our own . `` He turned on his second tube and opened for half a minute the fanlight over the door . Then as the air became perceptibly better , but our own symptoms more acute , he closed it once again . `` By the way , '' said he , `` man does not live upon oxygen alone . It 's dinner time and over . I assure you , gentlemen , that when I invited you to my home and to what I had hoped would be an interesting reunion , I had intended that my kitchen should justify itself . However , we must do what we can . I am sure that you will agree with me that it would be folly to consume our air too rapidly by lighting an oil-stove . I have some small provision of cold meats , bread , and pickles which , with a couple of bottles of claret , may serve our turn . Thank you , my dear -- -now as ever you are the queen of managers . `` It was indeed wonderful how , with the self-respect and sense of propriety of the British housekeeper , the lady had within a few minutes adorned the central table with a snow-white cloth , laid the napkins upon it , and set forth the simple meal with all the elegance of civilization , including an electric torch lamp in the centre . Wonderful also was it to find that our appetites were ravenous . `` It is the measure of our emotion , '' said Challenger with that air of condescension with which he brought his scientific mind to the explanation of humble facts . `` We have gone through a great crisis . That means molecular disturbance . That in turn means the need for repair . Great sorrow or great joy should bring intense hunger -- -not abstinence from food , as our novelists will have it . `` `` That 's why the country folk have great feasts at funerals , '' I hazarded. '' Exactly . Our young friend has hit upon an excellent illustration . Let me give you another slice of tongue . `` `` The same with savages , '' said Lord John , cutting away at the beef . `` I 've seen them buryin ' a chief up the Aruwimi River , and they ate a hippo that must have weighed as much as a tribe . There are some of them down New Guinea way that eat the late-lamented himself , just by way of a last tidy up . Well , of all the funeral feasts on this earth , I suppose the one we are takin ' is the queerest . `` `` The strange thing is , '' said Mrs . Challenger , `` that I find it impossible to feel grief for those who are gone . There are my father and mother at Bedford . I know that they are dead , and yet in this tremendous universal tragedy I can feel no sharp sorrow for any individuals , even for them . `` `` And my old mother in her cottage in Ireland , '' said I . `` I can see her in my mind 's eye , with her shawl and her lace cap , lying back with closed eyes in the old high-backed chair near the window , her glasses and her book beside her . Why should I mourn her ? She has passed and I am passing , and I may be nearer her in some other life than England is to Ireland . Yet I grieve to think that that dear body is no more . `` `` As to the body , '' remarked Challenger , `` we do not mourn over the parings of our nails nor the cut locks of our hair , though they were once part of ourselves . Neither does a one-legged man yearn sentimentally over his missing member . The physical body has rather been a source of pain and fatigue to us . It is the constant index of our limitations . Why then should we worry about its detachment from our psychical selves ? `` `` If they can indeed be detached , '' Summerlee grumbled . `` But , anyhow , universal death is dreadful . `` `` As I have already explained , '' said Challenger , `` a universal death must in its nature be far less terrible than a isolated one . `` `` Same in a battle , '' remarked Lord John . `` If you saw a single man lying on that floor with his chest knocked in and a hole in his face it would turn you sick . But I 've seen ten thousand on their backs in the Soudan , and it gave me no such feelin ' , for when you are makin ' history the life of any man is too small a thing to worry over . When a thousand million pass over together , same as happened to-day , you ca n't pick your own partic'lar out of the crowd . `` `` I wish it were well over with us , '' said the lady wistfully . `` Oh , George , I am so frightened . `` `` You 'll be the bravest of us all , little lady , when the time comes . I 've been a blusterous old husband to you , dear , but you 'll just bear in mind that G. E. C. is as he was made and could n't help himself . After all , you would n't have had anyone else ? `` `` No one in the whole wide world , dear , '' said she , and put her arms round his bull neck . We three walked to the window and stood amazed at the sight which met our eyes.Darkness had fallen and the dead world was shrouded in gloom . But right across the southern horizon was one long vivid scarlet streak , waxing and waning in vivid pulses of life , leaping suddenly to a crimson zenith and then dying down to a glowing line of fire . `` Lewes is ablaze ! `` `` No , it is Brighton which is burning , '' said Challenger , stepping across to join us . `` You can see the curved back of the downs against the glow . That fire is miles on the farther side of it . The whole town must be alight . `` There were several red glares at different points , and the pile ofdebrisupon the railway line was still smoldering darkly , but they all seemed mere pin-points of light compared to that monstrous conflagration throbbing beyond the hills . What copy it would have made for the
