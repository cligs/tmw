very gently . `` We all have our own ways of praying . Mine is a complete acquiescence in whatever fate may send me -- -a cheerful acquiescence . The highest religion and the highest science seem to unite on that . `` `` I can not truthfully describe my mental attitude as acquiescence and far less cheerful acquiescence , '' grumbled Summerlee over his pipe . `` I submit because I have to . I confess that I should have liked another year of life to finish my classification of the chalk fossils . `` `` Your unfinished work is a small thing , '' said Challenger pompously , `` when weighed against the fact that my ownmagnum opus , 'The Ladder of Life , ' is still in the first stages . My brain , my reading , my experience -- -in fact , my whole unique equipment -- -were to be condensed into that epoch-making volume . And yet , as I say , I acquiesce . `` `` I expect we 've all left some loose ends stickin ' out , '' said Lord John . `` What are yours , young fellah ? `` `` I was working at a book of verses , '' I answered . `` Well , the world has escaped that , anyhow , '' said Lord John . `` There 's always compensation somewhere if you grope around . `` `` What about you ? '' I asked . `` Well , it just so happens that I was tidied up and ready . I 'd promised Merivale to go to Tibet for a snow leopard in the spring . But it 's hard on you , Mrs . Challenger , when you have just built up this pretty home . `` `` Where George is , there is my home . But , oh , what would I not give for one last walk together in the fresh morning air upon those beautiful downs ! `` Our hearts re-echoed her words . The sun had burst through the gauzy mists which veiled it , and the whole broad Weald was washed in golden light . Sitting in our dark and poisonous atmosphere that glorious , clean , wind-swept countryside seemed a very dream of beauty . Mrs . Challenger held her hand stretched out to it in her longing . We drew up chairs and sat in a semicircle in the window . The atmosphere was already very close . It seemed to me that the shadows of death were drawing in upon us -- -the last of our race . It was like an invisible curtain closing down upon every side . `` That cylinder is not lastin ' too well , '' said Lord John with a long gasp for breath . `` The amount contained is variable , '' said Challenger , `` depending upon the pressure and care with which it has been bottled . I am inclined to agree with you , Roxton , that this one is defective . `` `` So we are to be cheated out of the last hour of our lives , '' Summerlee remarked bitterly . `` An excellent final illustration of the sordid age in which we have lived . Well , Challenger , now is your time if you wish to study the subjective phenomena of physical dissolution . `` `` Sit on the stool at my knee and give me your hand , '' said Challenger to his wife . `` I think , my friends , that a further delay in this insufferable atmosphere is hardly advisable . You would not desire it , dear , would you ? `` His wife gave a little groan and sank her face against his leg . `` I 've seen the folk bathin ' in the Serpentine in winter , '' said Lord John . `` When the rest are in , you see one or two shiverin ' on the bank , envyin ' the others that have taken the plunge . It 's the last that have the worst of it . I 'm all for a header and have done with it . `` `` You would open the window and face the ether ? `` `` Better be poisoned than stifled . `` Summerlee nodded his reluctant acquiescence and held out his thin hand to Challenger . `` We 've had our quarrels in our time , but that 's all over , '' said he . `` We were good friends and had a respect for each other under the surface . Good-by ! `` `` Good-by , young fellah ! '' said Lord John . `` The window 's plastered up . You ca n't open it . `` Challenger stooped and raised his wife , pressing her to his breast , while she threw her arms round his neck . `` Give me that field-glass , Malone , '' said he gravely.I handed it to him . `` Into the hands of the Power that made us we render ourselves again ! '' he shouted in his voice of thunder , and at the words he hurled the field-glass through the window.Full in our flushed faces , before the last tinkle of falling fragments had died away , there came the wholesome breath of the wind , blowing strong and sweet.I do n't know how long we sat in amazed silence . Then as in a dream , I heard Challenger 's voice once more . `` We are back in normal conditions , '' he cried . `` The world has cleared the poison belt , but we alone of all mankind are saved . `` I remember that we all sat gasping in our chairs , with that sweet , wet south-western breeze , fresh from the sea , flapping the muslin curtains and cooling our flushed faces . I wonder how long we sat ! None of us afterwards could agree at all on that point . We were bewildered , stunned , semi-conscious . We had all braced our courage for death , but this fearful and sudden new fact -- -that we must continue to live after we had survived the race to which we belonged -- -struck us with the shock of a physical blow and left us prostrate . Then gradually the suspended mechanism began to move once more ; the shuttles of memory worked ; ideas weaved themselves together in our minds . We saw , with vivid , merciless clearness , the relations between the past , the present , and the future -- -the lives that we had led and the lives which we would have to live . Our eyes turned in silent horror upon those of our companions and found the same answering look in theirs . Instead of the joy which men might have been expected to feel who had so narrowly escaped an imminent death , a terrible wave of darkest depression submerged us . Everything on earth that we loved had been washed away into the great , infinite , unknown ocean , and here were we marooned upon this desert island of a world , without companions , hopes , or aspirations . A few years ' skulking like jackals among the graves of the human race and then our belated and lonely end would come . `` It 's dreadful , George , dreadful ! '' the lady cried in an agony of sobs . `` If we had only passed with the others ! Oh , why did you save us ? I feel as if it is we that are dead and everyone else alive . `` Challenger 's great eyebrows were drawn down in concentrated thought , while his huge , hairy paw closed upon the outstretched hand of his wife . I had observed that she always held out her arms to him in trouble as a child would to its mother . `` Without being a fatalist to the point of nonresistance , '' said he , `` I have always found that the highest wisdom lies in an acquiescence with the actual . '' He spoke slowly , and there was a vibration of feeling in his sonorous voice . `` I donotacquiesce , '' said Summerlee firmly . `` I do n't see that it matters a row of pins whether you acquiesce or whether you do n't , '' remarked Lord John . `` You 've got to take it , whether you take it fightin ' or take it lyin ' down , so what 's the odds whether you acquiesce or not ? `` I ca n't remember that anyone asked our permission before the thing began , and nobody 's likely to ask it now . So what difference can it make what we may think of it ? `` `` It is just all the difference between happiness and misery , '' said Challenger with an abstracted face , still patting his wife 's hand . `` You can swim with the tide and have peace in mind and soul , or you can thrust against it and be bruised and weary . This business is beyond us , so let us accept it as it stands and say no more . `` `` But what in the world are we to do with our lives ? '' I asked , appealing in desperation to the blue , empty heaven . `` What am I to do , for example ? There are no newspapers , so there 's an end of my vocation . `` `` And there 's nothin ' left to shoot , and no more soldierin ' , so there 's an end of mine , '' said Lord John . `` And there are no students , so there 's an end of mine , '' cried Summerlee . `` But I have my husband and my house , so I can thank heaven that there is no end of mine , '' said the lady . `` Nor is there an end of mine , '' remarked Challenger , `` for science is not dead , and this catastrophe in itself will offer us many most absorbing problems for investigation . `` He had now flung open the windows and we were gazing out upon the silent and motionless landscape . `` Let me consider , '' he continued . `` It was about three , or a little after , yesterday afternoon that the world finally entered the poison belt to the extent of being completely submerged . It is now nine o'clock . The question is , at what hour did we pass out from it ? `` `` The air was very bad at daybreak , '' said I . `` Later than that , '' said Mrs . Challenger . `` As late as eight o'clock I distinctly felt the same choking at my throat which came at the outset . `` `` Then we shall say that it passed just after eight o'clock . For seventeen hours the world has been soaked in the poisonous ether . For that length of time the Great Gardener has sterilized the human mold which had grown over the surface of His fruit . Is it possible that the work is incompletely done -- -that others may have survived besides ourselves ? `` `` That 's what I was wonderin ' , '' said Lord John . `` Why should we be the only pebbles on the beach ? `` `` It is absurd to suppose that anyone besides ourselves can possibly have survived , '' said Summerlee with conviction . `` Consider that the poison was so virulent that even a
