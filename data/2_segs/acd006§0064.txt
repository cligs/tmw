one it 's for me . `` `` Ah , he must not bet ! '' cried Von Baumser , with upraised finger . `` You have right , though . It is for you , and from de proper quarter too , I think . `` It was the letter which we have already quoted . The major broke the seal and read it over very carefully , after which he read it again . Von Baumser , watching him across the table , saw a very anxious and troubled look upon his ruddy face . `` I hope dere is nothing wrong mit my good vriend , Madame Scully ? '' he remarked at last . `` No , nothing wrong with her . There is with some one else , though ; '' and with that he read to his companion all that part of his letter which referred to Miss Harston . `` Dat is no joke at all , '' the German remarked ; and the two sat for some little time lost in thought , the major with the letter still lying open upon his knee . `` What d 'ye think of it ? '' he asked at last . `` I think dat it is a more bad thing than the good madame seems to think . I think dat if Miss Harston says dat Herr Girdlestone intends to kill her , it is very likely dat he has dat intention '' '' Ged , he 's not a man to stick at troifles , '' the major said , rubbing his chin reflectively . `` Here 's a nice kettle of fish ! What the deuce could cause him to do such a thing ? `` `` Money , of course . I have told you , my good vriend , dat since a year de firm has been in a very bad way indeed . It is not generally known , but I know it , and so do others . Dis girl , I have heard , has money which would come to de old man in case of her death . It is as plain as de vingers on my hand . `` `` Be George , the thing looks very ugly ! '' said the major , pacing up and down the room . `` I believe that fellow and his beauty of a son are game for anything . Lavinia takes the mather too lightly . Fancy any one being such a scounthrel as to lay a hand on that dear girl , though . Ged , Baumser , it makes ivery drop of blood in me body tingle in me veins ! `` `` My dear vriend , '' Von Baumser answered , `` it is very good of your blood for to tingle , but I do not see how dat will help the mees . Let us be practical , and make up our brains what we should do . `` `` I must find young Dimsdale at once . He has a right to know . `` `` Yes , I should find him . Dere is no doubt that you and he should at once start off for dis place . I know dat young man . Dere vill be no holding him at all when he has heard of it . You must go too , to prevent him from doing dummheiten , and also because good Madame Scully has said so in her letter. '' '' Certainly . We shall go down togither . One of us will manage to see the young lady and find out if she requoires assistance . Bedad , if she does , she shall have it , guardian or no guardian . If we do n't whip her out in a brace of shakes me name 's not Clutterbuck . `` `` You must remember , '' remarked Baumser , `` dat dese people are desperate . If dey intend to murder a voman dey vould certainly not stick at a man or two men . You have no knowledge of how many dere may be . Dere is certainly Herr Girdlestone and his son and de man mit de eye , but madame knows not how many may be at de house . Remember also dat de police are not on your side , but rather against you , for as yet dere is no evidence dat any crime is intentioned . Ven you think of all dis I am sure dat you vill agree with me dat it would be vell to take mit you two or tree men dat would stick by you through thin and broad . `` The major was so busy in making his preparations for departure that he could only signify by a nod that he agreed with his friend 's remarks . `` What men could I git ? '' he asked . `` Dere is I myself , '' said the German , counting upon his big red fingers , `` and dere are some of our society who would very gladly come on such an errand , and are men who are altogether to be relied upon . Dere is little Fritz Bulow , of Kiel , and a Russian man whose name I disremember , but he is a good man . He vas a Nihilist at Odessa , and is sentenced to death suppose they could him catch . Dere are others as good , but it might take me time to find dem . Dese two I can very easily get . Dey are living together , and have neither of dem nothing to do . `` `` Bring them , then , '' said the major . `` Git a cab and run them down to Waterloo Station . That 's the one for Bedsworth . I 'll bring Dimsdale down with me and mate you there . In me opinion there 's no time to be lost . `` The major was ready to start , so Von Baumser threw on his coat and hat , and picked out a thick stick from a rack in the corner . `` We may need something of de sort , '' he said . `` I have me derringer , '' the soldier answered . They left the house together , and Von Baumser drove off to the East End , where his political friends resided . The major called a cab and rattled away to Phillimore Gardens and thence to the office , without being able to find the man of whom he was in search . He then rushed down the Strand as quickly as he could , intending to catch the next train and go alone , but on his way to Waterloo Station he fell in with Tom Dimsdale , as recorded in a preceding chapter.The letter was a thunderbolt to Tom , In his worst dreams he had never imagined anything so dark as this . He hurried back to the station at such a pace that the poor major was reduced to a most asthmatical and wheezy condition . He trotted along pluckily , however , and as he went heard the account of Tom 's adventures in the morning and of the departure of Ezra Girdlestone and of his red-bearded companion . The major 's face grew more anxious still when he heard of it . `` Pray God we may not be too late ! '' he panted.When Kate had made a clean breast of all her troubles to the widow Scully , and had secured that good woman 's co-operation , a great weight seemed to have been lifted from her heart , and she sprang from the shed a different woman . It would soon be like a dream , all these dreary weeks in the grim old house . Within a day she was sure that either Tom or the major would find means of communicating with her . The thought made her so happy that the colour stole back into her cheeks , and she sang for very lightness of heart as she made her way back to the Priory.Mrs . Jorrocks and Rebecca observed the change which had come over her and marvelled at it . Kate attempted to aid the former in her household work , but the old crone refused her assistance and repulsed her harshly . Her maid too answered her curtly when she addressed her , and eyed her in anything but a friendly manner . `` You do n't seem much the worse , '' she remarked , `` for all the wonderful things you seed in the night . `` `` Oh , do n't speak of it , '' said Kate . `` I am afraid that I have given you a great fright . I was feeling far from well , and I suppose that I must have imagined all about that dreadful monk . Yet , at the time , I assure you that I saw it as plainly as I see you now . `` `` What 's that she says ? '' asked Mrs. Jorrocks , with her hand to her ear . `` She says that she saw a ghost last night as plain as she sees you now . `` `` Pack of nonsense ! '' cried the old woman , rattling the poker in the grate . `` I 've been here afore she came -- -all alone in the house , too -- -and I hai n't seen nothing of the sort . When she 's got nothing else to grumble about she pretends as she has seen a ghost . `` `` No , no , '' the girl said cheerily . `` I am not grumbling -- -indeed I am not . `` `` It 's like her contrariness to say so , '' old Mrs. Jorrocks cried hoarsely . `` She 's always a-contradictin ' . `` `` You 're not in a good temper to-day , '' Kate remarked , and went off to her room , going up the steps two at a time with her old springy footstep.Rebecca followed her , and noticing the change , interpreted it in her own narrow fashion . `` You seems cheerful enough now , '' she said , standing at Kate 's door and looking into her room , with a bitter smile on her lips . `` To-morrow is Saturday . That 's what 's the matter with you . `` `` To-morrow Saturday ! '' Kate repeated in astonishment . `` Yes ; you know what I mean well enough . It 's no use pretending that you do n't . `` The girl 's manner was so aggressive that Kate was astonished . `` I have n't the least idea of what you mean , '' she said . `` Oh no , '' cried Rebecca , with her arms akimbo and a sneer on her face . `` She does n't know what I mean . She does n't know that her young man is coming down on the Saturday . She does not know that Mr. Ezra comes all the way from London on that day just for to see her . It is n't that that makes you cheerful , is it ? Oh , you double face ! '' The girl 's pretty features were all distorted with malice as she spoke , and her two hands were clenched passionately. '' Rebecca ! '' cried Kate energetically , `` I really think that you are the most complete fool that ever I met in my life . I will trouble you to remember that I am your mistress and you are my
