. My father was an officer in an Indian regiment who sent me home when I was quite a child . My mother was dead , and I had no relative in England . I was placed , however , in a comfortable boarding establishment at Edinburgh , and there I remained until I was seventeen years of age . In the year 1878 my father , who was senior captain of his regiment , obtained twelve months ' leave and came home . He telegraphed to me from London that he had arrived all safe , and directed me to come down at once , giving the Langham Hotel as his address . His message , as I remember , was full of kindness and love . On reaching London I drove to the Langham , and was informed that Captain Morstan was staying there , but that he had gone out the night before and had not yet returned . I waited all day without news of him . That night , on the advice of the manager of the hotel , I communicated with the police , and next morning we advertised in all the papers . Our inquiries led to no result ; and from that day to this no word has ever been heard of my unfortunate father . He came home with his heart full of hope , to find some peace , some comfort , and instead -- - '' She put her hand to her throat , and a choking sob cut short the sentence . `` The date ? '' asked Holmes , opening his note-book . `` He disappeared upon the 3d of December , 1878 , -- -nearly ten years ago . `` `` His luggage ? `` `` Remained at the hotel . There was nothing in it to suggest a clue , -- -some clothes , some books , and a considerable number of curiosities from the Andaman Islands . He had been one of the officers in charge of the convict-guard there . `` `` Had he any friends in town ? `` `` Only one that we know of , -- -Major Sholto , of his own regiment , the 34th Bombay Infantry . The major had retired some little time before , and lived at Upper Norwood . We communicated with him , of course , but he did not even know that his brother officer was in England . `` `` A singular case , '' remarked Holmes . `` I have not yet described to you the most singular part . About six years ago -- -to be exact , upon the 4th of May , 1882 -- -an advertisement appeared in the Times asking for the address of Miss Mary Morstan and stating that it would be to her advantage to come forward . There was no name or address appended . I had at that time just entered the family of Mrs. Cecil Forrester in the capacity of governess . By her advice I published my address in the advertisement column . The same day there arrived through the post a small card-board box addressed to me , which I found to contain a very large and lustrous pearl . No word of writing was enclosed . Since then every year upon the same date there has always appeared a similar box , containing a similar pearl , without any clue as to the sender . They have been pronounced by an expert to be of a rare variety and of considerable value . You can see for yourselves that they are very handsome . '' She opened a flat box as she spoke , and showed me six of the finest pearls that I had ever seen . `` Your statement is most interesting , '' said Sherlock Holmes . `` Has anything else occurred to you ? `` `` Yes , and no later than to-day . That is why I have come to you . This morning I received this letter , which you will perhaps read for yourself . `` `` Thank you , '' said Holmes . `` The envelope too , please . Postmark , London , S.W . Date , July 7 . Hum ! Man 's thumb-mark on corner , -- -probably postman . Best quality paper . Envelopes at sixpence a packet . Particular man in his stationery . No address . 'Be at the third pillar from the left outside the Lyceum Theatre to-night at seven o'clock . If you are distrustful , bring two friends . You are a wronged woman , and shall have justice . Do not bring police . If you do , all will be in vain . Your unknown friend . ' Well , really , this is a very pretty little mystery . What do you intend to do , Miss Morstan ? `` `` That is exactly what I want to ask you . `` `` Then we shall most certainly go . You and I and -- -yes , why , Dr. Watson is the very man . Your correspondent says two friends . He and I have worked together before . `` `` But would he come ? '' she asked , with something appealing in her voice and expression . `` I should be proud and happy , '' said I , fervently , `` if I can be of any service . `` `` You are both very kind , '' she answered . `` I have led a retired life , and have no friends whom I could appeal to . If I am here at six it will do , I suppose ? `` `` You must not be later , '' said Holmes . `` There is one other point , however . Is this handwriting the same as that upon the pearl-box addresses ? `` `` I have them here , '' she answered , producing half a dozen pieces of paper . `` You are certainly a model client . You have the correct intuition . Let us see , now . '' He spread out the papers upon the table , and gave little darting glances from one to the other . `` They are disguised hands , except the letter , '' he said , presently , `` but there can be no question as to the authorship . See how the irrepressible Greek e will break out , and see the twirl of the final s. They are undoubtedly by the same person . I should not like to suggest false hopes , Miss Morstan , but is there any resemblance between this hand and that of your father ? `` `` Nothing could be more unlike . `` `` I expected to hear you say so . We shall look out for you , then , at six . Pray allow me to keep the papers . I may look into the matter before then . It is only half-past three . Au revoir , then . `` `` Au revoir , '' said our visitor , and , with a bright , kindly glance from one to the other of us , she replaced her pearl-box in her bosom and hurried away . Standing at the window , I watched her walking briskly down the street , until the gray turban and white feather were but a speck in the sombre crowd . `` What a very attractive woman ! '' I exclaimed , turning to my companion.He had lit his pipe again , and was leaning back with drooping eyelids . `` Is she ? '' he said , languidly . `` I did not observe . `` `` You really are an automaton , -- -a calculating-machine ! '' I cried . `` There is something positively inhuman in you at times . `` He smiled gently . `` It is of the first importance , '' he said , `` not to allow your judgment to be biased by personal qualities . A client is to me a mere unit , -- -a factor in a problem . The emotional qualities are antagonistic to clear reasoning . I assure you that the most winning woman I ever knew was hanged for poisoning three little children for their insurance-money , and the most repellant man of my acquaintance is a philanthropist who has spent nearly a quarter of a million upon the London poor . `` `` In this case , however -- - '' '' I never make exceptions . An exception disproves the rule . Have you ever had occasion to study character in handwriting ? What do you make of this fellow 's scribble ? `` `` It is legible and regular , '' I answered . `` A man of business habits and some force of character . `` Holmes shook his head . `` Look at his long letters , '' he said . `` They hardly rise above the common herd . That d might be an a , and that l an e. Men of character always differentiate their long letters , however illegibly they may write . There is vacillation in his k 's and self-esteem in his capitals . I am going out now . I have some few references to make . Let me recommend this book , -- -one of the most remarkable ever penned . It is Winwood Reade 's 'Martyrdom of Man . ' I shall be back in an hour . `` I sat in the window with the volume in my hand , but my thoughts were far from the daring speculations of the writer . My mind ran upon our late visitor , -- -her smiles , the deep rich tones of her voice , the strange mystery which overhung her life . If she were seventeen at the time of her father 's disappearance she must be seven-and-twenty now , -- -a sweet age , when youth has lost its self-consciousness and become a little sobered by experience . So I sat and mused , until such dangerous thoughts came into my head that I hurried away to my desk and plunged furiously into the latest treatise upon pathology . What was I , an army surgeon with a weak leg and a weaker banking-account , that I should dare to think of such things ? She was a unit , a factor , -- -nothing more . If my future were black , it was better surely to face it like a man than to attempt to brighten it by mere will-o'-the-wisps of the imagination.It was half-past five before Holmes returned . He was bright , eager , and in excellent spirits , -- -a mood which in his case alternated with fits of the blackest depression . `` There is no great mystery in this matter , '' he said , taking the cup of tea which I had poured out for him . `` The facts appear to admit of only one explanation. '' '' What ! you have solved it already ? `` `` Well , that would be too much to say . I have discovered a suggestive fact , that is all . It is , however , VERY suggestive . The details are still to be added . I have just found , on consulting the back files of the Times , that Major Sholto , of Upper Norword , late of the 34th Bombay Infantry , died upon the 28th of April , 1882 . `` `` I may be very obtuse , Holmes , but I fail to see what this suggests. '' '' No ? You surprise me . Look at it in this way , then . Captain
