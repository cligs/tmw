and often mistake evil for good . What seems so sad to-day may , if taken in a proper spirit , be looked back upon as a starting-point from which all the good of your life has come . `` `` Bless you , sir ! '' said the widow , still furtively rubbing her eyes with the corner of her little shawl . `` You 're a real kind gentleman . It does me good to hear you talk . `` `` We have all our burdens and misfortunes , '' continued the senior partner . `` Some have more , some have less . To-day is your turn , to-morrow it may be mine . But let us struggle on to the great goal , and the weight of our burden need never cause us to sink by the wayside . And now I must wish you a very good morning , Mrs. Hudson . Believe me , you have my hearty sympathy . `` The woman rose and then stood irresolute for a moment , as though there was something which she still wished to mention . `` When will I be able to draw Jim 's back pay , sir ? '' she asked nervously . `` I have pawned nigh everything in the house , and the child and me is weak from want of food . `` `` Your husband 's back pay , '' the merchant said , taking down a ledger from the shelf and turning rapidly over the leaves . `` I think that you are under a delusion , Mrs. Hudson . Let me see -- -Dawson , Duffield , Everard , Francis , Gregory , Gunter , Hardy . Ah , here it is -- -Hudson , boatswain of theBlack Eagle . The wages which he received amounted , I see , to five pounds a month . The voyage lasted eight months , but the ship had only been out two months and a half when your husband died . `` `` That 's true , sir , '' the widow said , with an anxious look at the long line of figures in the ledger . `` Of course , the contract ended at his death , so the firm owed him twelve pounds ten at that date . But I perceive from my books that you have been drawing half-pay during the whole eight months . You have accordingly had twenty pounds from the firm , and are therefore in its debt to the amount of seven pounds ten shillings . We 'll say nothing of that at present , '' the senior partner concluded with a magnificent air . `` When you are a little better off you can make good the balance , but really you can hardly expect us to assist you any further at present . `` `` But , sir , we have nothing , '' Mrs. Hudson sobbed . `` It is deplorable , most deplorable . But we are not the people to apply to . Your own good sense will tell you that , now that I have explained it to you . Good morning . I wish you good fortune , and hope you will let us know from time to time how you go on . We always take a keen interest in the families of those who serve us . '' Mr. Girdlestone opened the door , and the heart-sick little woman staggered away across the office , still bearing her heavy child.When she got into the open air she stared around her like one dazed . The senior clerk looked anxiously at her as he stood at the open door . Then he glanced back into the office . Ezra Girdlestone was deep in some accounts , and his brother clerks were all absorbed in their work . He stole up to the woman , with an apologetic smile , slipped something into her hand , and then hurried back into the office with an austere look upon his face , as if his whole mind were absorbed in the affairs of the firm . There are speculations above the ken of business men . Perhaps , Thomas Gilray , that ill-spared half-crown of yours may bring in better interest than the five-and-twenty pounds of your employer.The head of the firm had hardly recovered his mental serenity after the painful duty of explaining her financial position to the Widow Hudson , when his quick ear caught the sound of a heavy footstep in the counting-house . A gruff voice was audible at the same time , which demanded in rather more energetic language than was usually employed in that orderly establishment , whether the principal was to be seen or not . The answer was evidently in the affirmative , for the lumbering tread came rapidly nearer , and a powerful double knock announced that the visitor was at the other side of the door . `` Come in , '' cried Mr. Girdlestone , laying down his pen.This invitation was so far complied with that the handle turned , and the door revolved slowly upon its hinges . Nothing more substantial than a strong smell of spirituous liquors , however , entered the apartment . `` Come in , '' the merchant repeated impatiently.At this second mandate a great tangled mass of black hair was slowly protruded round the angle of the door . Then a copper-coloured forehead appeared , with a couple of very shaggy eyebrows and eventually a pair of eyes , which protruded from their sockets and looked yellow and unhealthy . These took a long look , first at the senior partner and then at his surroundings , after which , as if reassured by the inspection , the remainder of the face appeared -- -a flat nose , a large mouth with a lower lip which hung down and exposed a line of tobacco-stained teeth , and finally a thick black beard which bristled straight out from the chin , and bore abundant traces of an egg having formed part of its owner 's morning meal . The head having appeared , the body soon followed it , though all in the same anaconda-like style of progression , until the individual stood revealed . He was a stoutly-built sea-faring man , dressed in a pea jacket and blue trousers and holding his tarpaulin hat in his hand . With a rough scrape and a most unpleasant leer he advanced towards the merchant , a tattoed and hairy hand outstretched in sign of greeting . `` Why , captain , '' said the head of the firm , rising and grasping the other 's hand with effusion , `` I am glad to see you back safe and well . `` `` Glad to see ye , sir -- -glad to see ye . `` His voice was thick and husky , and there was an indecision about his gait as though he had been drinking heavily . `` I came in sort o ' cautious , '' he continued , `` 'cause I did n't know who might be about . When you and me speaks together we likes to speak alone , you bet . `` The merchant raised his bushy eyebrows a little , as though he did not relish the idea of mutual confidences suggested by his companion 's remark . `` Had n't you better take a seat ? '' he said.The other took a cane-bottomed chair and carried it into the extreme corner of the office . Then having looked steadily at the wall behind him , and rapped it with his knuckles , he sat down , still throwing an occasional apprehensive glance over his shoulder . `` I 've got a touch of the jumps , '' he remarked apologetically to his employer . `` I likes toknowas there ai n't no one behind me . `` `` You should give up this shocking habit of drinking , '' Mr. Girdlestone said seriously . `` It is a waste of the best gifts with which Providence has endowed us . You are the worse for it both in this world and in the next . `` Captain Hamilton Miggs did not seem to be at all impressed by this very sensible piece of advice . On the contrary , he chuckled boisterously to himself , and , slapping his thigh , expressed his opinion that his employer was a `` rum 'un '' -- -a conviction which he repeated to himself several times with various symptoms of admiration . `` Well , well , '' Girdlestone said , after a short pause , `` boys will be boys , and sailors , I suppose , will be sailors . After eight months of anxiety and toil , ending in success , captain -- -I am proud to be able to say the words -- -some little licence must be allowed . I do not judge others by the same hard and fast lines by which I regulate my own conduct . `` This admirable sentiment also failed to elicit any response from the obdurate Miggs , except the same manifestations of mirth and the same audible aside as to the peculiarities of his master 's character . `` I must congratulate you on your cargo , and wish you the same luck for your next voyage , '' the merchant continued . `` Ivory , an ' gold dust , an ' skins , an ' resin , an ' cochineal , an ' gums , an ' ebony , an ' rice , an ' tobacco , an ' fruits , an ' nuts in bulk . If there 's a better cargo about , I 'd like to see it , '' the sailor said defiantly . `` An excellent cargo , captain ; very good indeed . Three of your men died , I believe ? `` `` Ay , three of the lubbers went under . Two o ' fever and one o ' snake-bite . It licks me what sailors are comin ' to in these days . When I was afore the mast we 'd ha ' been ashamed to die o ' a trifle like that . Look at me . I 've been down wi ' coast fever sixteen times , and I 've had yellow jack an ' dysentery , an ' I 've been bit by the black cobra in the Andamans . I 've had cholera , too . It broke out in a brig when I was in the Sandwich Island trade , and I was shipmates wi ' seven dead out o ' a crew o ' ten . But I ai n't none the worse for it -- -no , nor never will be . But I say , gov'nor , hai n't you got a drop of something about the office ? `` The senior partner rose , and taking a bottle from the cupboard filled out a stiff glass of rum . The sailor drank it off eagerly , and laid down the empty tumbler with a sigh of satisfaction . `` Say , now , '' he said , with an unpleasant confidential leer , `` were n't you surprised to see us come back -- -eh ? Straight now , between man and man ? `` `` The old ship hangs together well , and has lots of work in her yet , '' the merchant answered . `` Lots of work ! God 's truth , I thought she was gone in the bay ! We 'd a dirty night with a gale from the west-sou'-west , an ' had been goin ' by dead reckonin ' for three days , so
