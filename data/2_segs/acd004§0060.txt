eyelids . 'And in every way such a glove as might be worn by the fairest and sweetest lady in England , ' quoth the Englishman . 'It may be so , ' said the Sieur de Crespigny , turning his face from him . 'I am myself weak in the eyes , and have often taken one thing for another , ' quoth the knight , as he sprang back into his saddle and rode off , leaving the Sieur de Crespigny biting his nails before the door . Ha ! by the five wounds , many men of war have drunk my wine , but never one was more to my fancy than this little Englishman . `` `` By my hilt ! he is our master , Michel , '' quoth Aylward , `` and such men as we do not serve under a laggart . But here are four deniers , Michel , and God be with you ! En avant , camarades ! for we have a long road before us . `` At a brisk trot the three friends left Cardillac and its wine-house behind them , riding without a halt past St. Macaire , and on by ferry over the river Dorpt . At the further side the road winds through La Reolle , Bazaille , and Marmande , with the sunlit river still gleaming upon the right , and the bare poplars bristling up upon either side . John and Alleyne rode silent on either side , but every inn , farm-steading , or castle brought back to Aylward some remembrance of love , foray , or plunder , with which to beguile the way . `` There is the smoke from Bazas , on the further side of Garonne , '' quoth he . `` There were three sisters yonder , the daughters of a farrier , and , by these ten finger-bones ! a man might ride for a long June day and never set eyes upon such maidens . There was Marie , tall and grave , and Blanche petite and gay , and the dark Agnes , with eyes that went through you like a waxed arrow . I lingered there as long as four days , and was betrothed to them all ; for it seemed shame to set one above her sisters , and might make ill blood in the family . Yet , for all my care , things were not merry in the house , and I thought it well to come away . There , too , is the mill of Le Souris . Old Pierre Le Caron , who owned it , was a right good comrade , and had ever a seat and a crust for a weary archer . He was a man who wrought hard at all that he turned his hand to ; but he heated himself in grinding bones to mix with his flour , and so through over-diligence he brought a fever upon himself and died . `` `` Tell me , Aylward , '' said Alleyne , `` what was amiss with the door of yonder inn that you should ask me to observe it. '' '' Pardieu ! yes , I had well-nigh forgot . What saw you on yonder door ? `` `` I saw a square hole , through which doubtless the host may peep when he is not too sure of those who knock . `` `` And saw you naught else ? `` `` I marked that beneath this hole there was a deep cut in the door , as though a great nail had been driven in . `` `` And naught else ? '' '' No . `` `` Had you looked more closely you might have seen that there was a stain upon the wood . The first time that I ever heard my comrade Black Simon laugh was in front of that door . I heard him once again when he slew a French squire with his teeth , he being unarmed and the Frenchman having a dagger . `` `` And why did Simon laugh in front of the inn-door ! '' asked John . `` Simon is a hard and perilous man when he hath the bitter drop in him ; and , by my hilt ! he was born for war , for there is little sweetness or rest in him . This inn , the 'Mouton d'Or , ' was kept in the old days by one Francois Gourval , who had a hard fist and a harder heart . It was said that many and many an archer coming from the wars had been served with wine with simples in it , until he slept , and had then been stripped of all by this Gourval . Then on the morrow , if he made complaint , this wicked Gourval would throw him out upon the road or beat him , for he was a very lusty man , and had many stout varlets in his service . This chanced to come to Simon 's ears when we were at Bordeaux together , and he would have it that we should ride to Cardillac with a good hempen cord , and give this Gourval such a scourging as he merited . Forth we rode then , but when we came to the 'Mouton d'Or , ' Gourval had had word of our coming and its purpose , so that the door was barred , nor was there any way into the house . 'Let us in , good Master Gourval ! ' cried Simon , and 'Let us in , good Master Gourval ! ' cried I , but no word could we get through the hole in the door , save that he would draw an arrow upon us unless we went on our way . 'Well , Master Gourval , ' quoth Simon at last , 'this is but a sorry welcome , seeing that we have ridden so far just to shake you by the hand . ' 'Canst shake me by the hand without coming in , ' said Gourval . 'And how that ? ' asked Simon . 'By passing in your hand through the hole , ' said he . 'Nay , my hand is wounded , ' quoth Simon , 'and of such a size that I can not pass it in . ' 'That need not hinder , ' said Gourval , who was hot to be rid of us , 'pass in your left hand . ' 'But I have something for thee , Gourval , ' said Simon . 'What then ? ' he asked . 'There was an English archer who slept here last week of the name of Hugh of Nutbourne . ' 'We have had many rogues here , ' said Gourval . 'His conscience hath been heavy within him because he owes you a debt of fourteen deniers , having drunk wine for which he hath never paid . For the easing of his soul , he asked me to pay the money to you as I passed . ' Now this Gourval was very greedy for money , so he thrust forth his hand for the fourteen deniers , but Simon had his dagger ready and he pinned his hand to the door . 'I have paid the Englishman 's debt , Gourval ! ' quoth he , and so rode away , laughing so that he could scarce sit his horse , leaving mine host still nailed to his door . Such is the story of the hole which you have marked , and of the smudge upon the wood . I have heard that from that time English archers have been better treated in the auberge of Cardillac . But what have we here by the wayside ? `` `` It appears to be a very holy man , '' said Alleyne . `` And , by the rood ! he hath some strange wares , '' cried John . `` What are these bits of stone , and of wood , and rusted nails , which are set out in front of him ? `` The man whom they had remarked sat with his back against a cherry-tree , and his legs shooting out in front of him , like one who is greatly at his ease . Across his thighs was a wooden board , and scattered over it all manner of slips of wood and knobs of brick and stone , each laid separate from the other , as a huckster places his wares . He was dressed in a long gray gown , and wore a broad hat of the same color , much weather-stained , with three scallop-shells dangling from the brim . As they approached , the travellers observed that he was advanced in years , and that his eyes were upturned and yellow . `` Dear knights and gentlemen , '' he cried in a high crackling voice , `` worthy Christian cavaliers , will ye ride past and leave an aged pilgrim to die of hunger ? The sight hast been burned from mine eyes by the sands of the Holy Land , and I have had neither crust of bread nor cup of wine these two days past . `` `` By my hilt ! father , '' said Aylward , looking keenly at him , `` it is a marvel to me that thy girdle should have so goodly a span and clip thee so closely , if you have in sooth had so little to place within it . `` `` Kind stranger , '' answered the pilgrim , `` you have unwittingly spoken words which are very grievous to me to listen to . Yet I should be loth to blame you , for I doubt not that what you said was not meant to sadden me , nor to bring my sore affliction back to my mind . It ill becomes me to prate too much of what I have endured for the faith , and yet , since you have observed it , I must tell you that this thickness and roundness of the waist is caused by a dropsy brought on by over-haste in journeying from the house of Pilate to the Mount of Olives . `` `` There , Aylward , '' said Alleyne , with a reddened cheek , `` let that curb your blunt tongue . How could you bring a fresh pang to this holy man , who hath endured so much and hath journeyed as far as Christ 's own blessed tomb ? `` `` May the foul fiend strike me dumb ! '' cried the bowman in hot repentance ; but both the palmer and Alleyne threw up their hands to stop him . `` I forgive thee from my heart , dear brother , '' piped the blind man . `` But , oh , these wild words of thine are worse to mine ears than aught which you could say of me . `` `` Not another word shall I speak , '' said Aylward ; `` but here is a franc for thee and I crave thy blessing . `` `` And here is another , '' said Alleyne . `` And another , '' cried Hordle John.But the blind palmer would have none of their alms . `` Foolish , foolish pride ! '' he cried , beating upon his chest with his large brown hand . `` Foolish , foolish pride ! How long then will it be ere I can scourge it forth ? Am I then never to conquer it ? Oh , strong , strong are the ties of flesh , and hard it is
