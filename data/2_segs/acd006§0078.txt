them steadily down Channel , until on the third day they saw the Isle of Ushant lying low upon the sky-line . No inquisitive gunboat or lurking police launch came within sight of them , though whenever any vessel 's course brought her in their direction the heart of Ezra Girdlestone sank within him . On one occasion a small brig signalled to them , and the wretched fugitives , when they saw the flags run up , thought that all was lost . It proved , however , to be merely some trivial message , and the two owners breathed again.The wind fell away on the day that they cleared the Channel , and the whole surface of the sea was like a great expanse of quicksilver , which shimmered in the rays of the wintry sun . There was still a considerable swell after the recent gale , and theBlack Eaglelay rolling about as though she had learned habits of inebriation from her skipper . The sky was very clear above , but all round the horizon a low haze lay upon the water . So silent was it that the creaking of the boats as they swung at the davits , and the straining of the shrouds as the ship rolled , sounded loud and clear , as did the raucous cries of a couple of gulls which hovered round the poop . Every now and then a rumbling noise ending in a thud down below showed that the swing of the ship had caused something to come down with a run . Underlying all other sounds , however , was a muffled clank , clank , which might almost make one forget that this was a sailing ship , it sounded so like the chipping of a propeller . `` What is that noise , Captain Miggs ? '' asked John Girdlestone as he stood leaning over the quarter rail , while the old sea-dog , sextant in hand , was taking his midday observations . The captain had been on his good behaviour since the unexpected advent of his employers , and he was now in a wonderful and unprecedented state of sobriety . `` Them 's the pumps a-goin ' , '' Miggs answered , packing his sextant away in its case . `` The pumps ! I thought they were only used when a ship was in danger ? `` Ezra came along the deck at this moment , and listened with interest to the conversation . `` This ship is in danger , '' Miggs remarked calmly . `` In danger ! '' cried Ezra , looking round the clear sky and placid sea . `` Where is the danger ? I did not think you were such an old woman , Miggs . `` `` We will see about that , '' the seaman answered angrily . `` If a ship 's got no bottom in her she 's bound to be in danger , be the weather fair or foul . `` `` Do you mean to tell me this ship has no bottom ? `` `` I mean to tell you that there are places where you could put your fingers through her seams . It 's only the pumpin ' that keeps her afloat . `` `` This is a pretty state of things , '' said Girdlestone . `` How is it that I have not been informed of it before ! It is most dangerous. '' '' Informed ! '' cried Miggs . `` Informed of it ! Has there been a v'yage yet that I have n't come to ye , Muster Girdlestone , and told ye I was surprised ever to find myself back in Lunnon ? A year agone I told ye how this ship was , and ye laughed at me , ye did . It 's only when ye find yourselves on her in the middle o ' the broad sea that ye understan ' what it is that sailor folk have to put up wi ' . `` Girdlestone was about to make some angry reply to this address , but his son put his hand on his arm to restrain him . It would never do to quarrel with Hamilton Miggs before they reached their port of refuge . They were too completely in his power . `` What the captain says has a great deal of truth in it , '' he remarked , with a laugh . `` You do n't realize a thing until you 've had to experience it . TheBlack Eagleshall certainly have an overhauling next time , and we 'll see if we ca n't give her captain an increase at the same time . `` Miggs gave a grunt which , might be taken as expressing thanks or as signifying doubt . Perhaps there was a mixture of both in his mind . `` I presume , '' Girdlestone said , in a conciliatory voice , `` that there would be no real danger as long as the weather was fine ? `` `` It wo n't be fine long , '' the captain answered gruffly . `` The glass was well under thirty when I come up , and it is fallin ' fast . I 've been about here before at this time o ' year in a calm , with a ground swell and a sinkin ' glass . No good ever came of it . Look there at the norrard . What d 'ye make o ' that , Sandy ? `` `` In conjunction wi ' the descending glass , it has an ominous appairance , '' the Scotchman answered , with much stress on the first syllable of the adjective.The phenomenon which had attracted their professional attention did not appear to either of the Girdlestones to be a very important one . The haze on the horizon to the north was rather thicker than elsewhere , and a few thin streaky clouds straggled upwards across the clear cold heaven , like the feelers of some giant octopus which lay behind the fog bank . At the same time the sea changed in places from the appearance of quicksilver to that of grained glass . `` There 's the wind , '' Miggs said confidently . `` I 'd furl the top-gallant sails and get her stay-sails down , Mr . McPherson . '' Whenever he gave an order he was careful to give the mate his full title , though at other times he called him indiscriminately Sandy or Mac.The mate gave the necessary commands , while Miggs dived down into the cabin . He came up again looking even graver than when he left the deck . `` The glass is nearly down to twenty-eight , '' he said . `` I never seed it as low since I 've been at sea . Take in the mains'l , Mr. McPherson , and have the topsails reefed down ! `` `` Ay , ay , sir . `` There was no lack of noise now as the men hauled at the halliards with their shrill strange cries , which sounded like the piping of innumerable sea-birds . Half a dozen lay out on the yard above , tucking away the great sail and making all snug . `` Take a reef in the fores'l ! '' the mate roared , `` and look alive about it ! `` `` Hurry up , ye swabs ! '' Miggs bellowed . `` You 'll be blown away , every mother 's son of ye , if you do n't stir yourselves ! `` Even the two landsmen could see now that the danger was no imaginary one , and that a storm was about to burst over them . The long black lines of vapour had lengthened and coalesced , until now the whole northern heaven was one great rolling black cloud , with an angry , ragged fringe which bespoke the violence of the wind that drove it . Here and there against the deep black background a small whitish or sulphur-coloured wreath stood clearly out , looking livid and dangerous . The whole great mass was sweeping onwards with prodigious and majestic rapidity , darkening the ocean beneath it , and emitting a dull , moaning , muttering sound , which was indescribably menacing and mournful . `` This may be the same gale as was on some days ago , '' Miggs remarked . `` They travel in circles very often , and come back to where they start from . `` `` We are all snug aloft , but this ship wo n't stand much knocking about , an ' that 's a fact , '' observed the mate gloomily.It was blowing now in short frequent puffs , which ruffled the surface of the water , and caused theBlack Eagleto surge slowly forward over the rollers . A few drops of rain came pattering down upon the deck . The great bank of cloud was above the ship , still hurrying wildly across the heavens . `` Look out ! '' cried an old quartermaster . `` Here she comes ! `` As he spoke the storm burst with a shriek , as though all the demons of the air had been suddenly unchained and were rejoicing in their freedom . The force of the blast was so great that Girdlestone could almost have believed that he had been struck by some solid object . The barque heeled over until her lee rail touched the water , and lay so for a minute or more in a smother of foam . Her deck was at such an angle that it seemed as though she never could right herself . Gradually , however , she rose a little , staggered and trembled like a living thing , and then plunged away through the storm , as a piece of paper is whirled before the wind.By evening the gale was at its height . TheBlack Eaglewas running under maintopsail and foretopmast staysail . The sea had risen very quickly , as it will when wind comes upon a swell . As far as the eye could see from the summit of a wave there was a vista of dark towering ridges with their threatening crests of foam . When the barque sank in the hollow these gleaming summits rose as high as her mainyard , and the two fugitives , clinging to the weather-shrouds , looked up in terror and amazement at the masses of water which hung above them . Once or twice waves actually broke over the vessel , crashing and roaring down the deck , and washing hither and thither until gradually absorbed between the planks or drained away through the scupper-holes . On each of these occasions the poor rotten vessel would lurch and shiver in every plank , as if with a foreknowledge of her fate.It was a dreary night for all on board . As long as there was light they could at least see what danger was to be faced , but now the barque was plunging and tossing through an inky obscurity . With a wild scooping motion she was hurled up on the summit of a great wave , and thence she shot down into the black gulf beyond with such force that when checked by meeting the next billow her whole fabric jarred from truck to keelson . There were two seamen at the wheel and two at the relieving tackles , yet it was all that they could do among the wild commotion to keep her steady.No one thought of going below . It was better to see and know the worst than to be shut up in a coffin where one could not
