mort du chien ! To hang ! `` `` It is my vow , '' said Sir Nigel shortly . `` From what I hear , you thought little enough of hanging others . `` `` Peasants , base roturiers , '' cried the other . `` It is their fitting death . Mais Le Seigneur d'Andelys , avec le sang des rois dans ses veins ! C'est incroyable ! `` Sir Nigel turned upon his heel , while two seamen cast a noose over the pirate 's neck . At the touch of the cord he snapped the bonds which bound him , dashed one of the archers to the deck , and seizing the other round the waist sprang with him into the sea . `` By my hilt , he is gone ! '' cried Aylward , rushing to the side . `` They have sunk together like a stone . `` `` I am right glad of it , '' answered Sir Nigel ; `` for though it was against my vow to loose him , I deem that he has carried himself like a very gentle and debonnaire cavalier . `` For two days the yellow cog ran swiftly before a northeasterly wind , and on the dawn of the third the high land of Ushant lay like a mist upon the shimmering sky-line . There came a plump of rain towards mid-day and the breeze died down , but it freshened again before nightfall , and Goodwin Hawtayne veered his sheet and held head for the south . Next morning they had passed Belle Isle , and ran through the midst of a fleet of transports returning from Guienne . Sir Nigel Loring and Sir Oliver Buttesthorn at once hung their shields over the side , and displayed their pennons as was the custom , noting with the keenest interest the answering symbols which told the names of the cavaliers who had been constrained by ill health or wounds to leave the prince at so critical a time.That evening a great dun-colored cloud banked up in the west , and an anxious man was Goodwin Hawtayne , for a third part of his crew had been slain , and half the remainder were aboard the galleys , so that , with an injured ship , he was little fit to meet such a storm as sweeps over those waters . All night it blew in short fitful puffs , heeling the great cog over until the water curled over her lee bulwarks . As the wind still freshened the yard was lowered half way down the mast in the morning . Alleyne , wretchedly ill and weak , with his head still ringing from the blow which he had received , crawled up upon deck . Water-swept and aslant , it was preferable to the noisome , rat-haunted dungeons which served as cabins . There , clinging to the stout halliards of the sheet , he gazed with amazement at the long lines of black waves , each with its curling ridge of foam , racing in endless succession from out the inexhaustible west . A huge sombre cloud , flecked with livid blotches , stretched over the whole seaward sky-line , with long ragged streamers whirled out in front of it . Far behind them the two galleys labored heavily , now sinking between the rollers until their yards were level with the waves , and again shooting up with a reeling , scooping motion until every spar and rope stood out hard against the sky . On the left the low-lying land stretched in a dim haze , rising here and there into a darker blur which marked the higher capes and headlands . The land of France ! Alleyne 's eyes shone as he gazed upon it . The land of France ! -- -the very words sounded as the call of a bugle in the ears of the youth of England . The land where their fathers had bled , the home of chivalry and of knightly deeds , the country of gallant men , of courtly women , of princely buildings , of the wise , the polished and the sainted . There it lay , so still and gray beneath the drifting wrack -- -the home of things noble and of things shameful -- -the theatre where a new name might be made or an old one marred . From his bosom to his lips came the crumpled veil , and he breathed a vow that if valor and goodwill could raise him to his lady 's side , then death alone should hold him back from her . His thoughts were still in the woods of Minstead and the old armory of Twynham Castle , when the hoarse voice of the master-shipman brought them back once more to the Bay of Biscay . `` By my troth , young sir , '' he said , `` you are as long in the face as the devil at a christening , and I can not marvel at it , for I have sailed these waters since I was as high as this whinyard , and yet I never saw more sure promise of an evil night . `` `` Nay , I had other things upon my mind , '' the squire answered . `` And so has every man , '' cried Hawtayne in an injured voice . `` Let the shipman see to it . It is the master-shipman 's affair . Put it all upon good Master Hawtayne ! Never had I so much care since first I blew trumpet and showed cartel at the west gate of Southampton . `` `` What is amiss then ? '' asked Alleyne , for the man 's words were as gusty as the weather . `` Amiss , quotha ? Here am I with but half my mariners , and a hole in the ship where that twenty-devil stone struck us big enough to fit the fat widow of Northam through . It is well enough on this tack , but I would have you tell me what I am to do on the other . We are like to have salt water upon us until we be found pickled like the herrings in an Easterling 's barrels . `` `` What says Sir Nigel to it ? `` `` He is below pricking out the coat-armor of his mother 's uncle . 'Pester me not with such small matters ! ' was all that I could get from him . Then there is Sir Oliver . 'Fry them in oil with a dressing of Gascony , ' quoth he , and then swore at me because I had not been the cook . 'Walawa , ' thought I , 'mad master , sober man ' -- -so away forward to the archers . Harrow and alas ! but they were worse than the others . `` `` Would they not help you then ? `` `` Nay , they sat tway and tway at a board , him that they call Aylward and the great red-headed man who snapped the Norman 's arm-bone , and the black man from Norwich , and a score of others , rattling their dice in an archer 's gauntlet for want of a box . 'The ship can scarce last much longer , my masters , ' quoth I . 'That is your business , old swine's-head , ' cried the black galliard . 'Le diable t'emporte , ' says Aylward . 'A five , a four and the main , ' shouted the big man , with a voice like the flap of a sail . Hark to them now , young sir , and say if I speak not sooth . `` As he spoke , there sounded high above the shriek of the gale and the straining of the timbers a gust of oaths with a roar of deep-chested mirth from the gamblers in the forecastle . `` Can I be of avail ? '' asked Alleyne . `` Say the word and the thing is done , if two hands may do it . `` `` Nay , nay , your head I can see is still totty , and i ' faith little head would you have , had your bassinet not stood your friend . All that may be done is already carried out , for we have stuffed the gape with sails and corded it without and within . Yet when we bale our bowline and veer the sheet our lives will hang upon the breach remaining blocked . See how yonder headland looms upon us through the mist ! We must tack within three arrow flights , or we may find a rock through our timbers . Now , St. Christopher be praised ! here is Sir Nigel , with whom I may confer . `` `` I prythee that you will pardon me , '' said the knight , clutching his way along the bulwark . `` I would not show lack of courtesy toward a worthy man , but I was deep in a matter of some weight , concerning which , Alleyne , I should be glad of your rede . It touches the question of dimidiation or impalement in the coat of mine uncle , Sir John Leighton of Shropshire , who took unto wife the widow of Sir Henry Oglander of Nunwell . The case has been much debated by pursuivants and kings-of-arms . But how is it with you , master shipman ? `` `` Ill enough , my fair lord . The cog must go about anon , and I know not how we may keep the water out of her . `` `` Go call Sir Oliver ! '' said Sir Nigel , and presently the portly knight made his way all astraddle down the slippery deck . `` By my soul , master-shipman , this passes all patience ! '' he cried wrathfully . `` If this ship of yours must needs dance and skip like a clown at a kermesse , then I pray you that you will put me into one of these galeasses . I had but sat down to a flask of malvoisie and a mortress of brawn , as is my use about this hour , when there comes a cherking , and I find my wine over my legs and the flask in my lap , and then as I stoop to clip it there comes another cursed cherk , and there is a mortress of brawn stuck fast to the nape of my neck . At this moment I have two pages coursing after it from side to side , like hounds behind a leveret . Never did living pig gambol more lightly . But you have sent for me , Sir Nigel ? `` `` I would fain have your rede , Sir Oliver , for Master Hawtayne hath fears that when we veer there may come danger from the hole in our side . `` `` Then do not veer , '' quoth Sir Oliver hastily . `` And now , fair sir , I must hasten back to see how my rogues have fared with the brawn . `` `` Nay , but this will scarce suffice , '' cried the shipman . `` If we do not veer we will be upon the rocks within the hour . `` `` Then veer , '' said Sir Oliver . `` There is my rede ; and now , Sir Nigel , I must crave -- -- -- '' At this instant , however , a startled shout rang out from two seamen upon the forecastle . `` Rocks ! '' they yelled ,
