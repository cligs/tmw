knot of children with a favourite doll . The black undercoat was drawn on , the cravat of rich lace adjusted , the loose overcoat secured , two handkerchiefs of costly point carried forward upon an enamelled saucer , and thrust by separate officials into each side pocket , the silver and ebony cane laid to hand , and the monarch was ready for the labours of the day.During the half-hour or so which had been occupied in this manner there had been a constant opening and closing of the chamber door , and a muttering of names from the captain of the guard to the attendant in charge , and from the attendant in charge to the first gentleman of the chamber , ending always in the admission of some new visitor . Each as he entered bowed profoundly three times , as a salute to majesty , and then attached himself to his own little clique or coterie , to gossip in a low voice over the news , the weather , and the plans of the day . Gradually the numbers increased , until by the time the king 's frugal first breakfast of bread and twice watered wine had been carried in , the large square chamber was quite filled with a throng of men many of whom had helped to make the epoch the most illustrious of French history . Here , close by the king , was the harsh but energetic Louvois , all-powerful now since the death of his rival Colbert , discussing a question of military organisation with two officers , the one a tall and stately soldier , the other a strange little figure , undersized and misshapen , but bearing the insignia of a marshal of France , and owning a name which was of evil omen over the Dutch frontier , for Luxembourg was looked upon already as the successor of Conde , even as his companion Vauban was of Turenne . Beside them , a small white-haired clerical with a kindly face , Pere la Chaise , confessor to the king , was whispering his views upon Jansenism to the portly Bossuet , the eloquent Bishop of Meaux , and to the tall thin young Abbe de Fenelon , who listened with a clouded brow , for it was suspected that his own opinions were tainted with the heresy in question . There , too , was Le Brun , the painter , discussing art in a small circle which contained his fellow-workers Verrio and Laguerre , the architects Blondel and Le Notre , and sculptors Girardon , Puget , Desjardins , and Coysevox , whose works had done so much to beautify the new palace of the king . Close to the door , Racine , with his handsome face wreathed in smiles , was chatting with the poet Boileau and the architect Mansard , the three laughing and jesting with the freedom which was natural to the favourite servants of the king , the only subjects who might walk unannounced and without ceremony into and out of his chamber . `` What is amiss with him this morning ? '' asked Boileau in a whisper , nodding his head in the direction of the royal group . `` I fear that his sleep has not improved his temper . `` `` He becomes harder and harder to amuse , '' said Racine , shaking his head . `` I am to be at Madame De Maintenon 's room at three to see whether a page or two of thePhedremay not work a change . `` `` My friend , '' said the architect , `` do you not think that madame herself might be a better consoler than yourPhedre ? `` `` Madame is a wonderful woman . She has brains , she has heart , she has tact -- -she is admirable . `` `` And yet she has one gift too many . `` `` And that is ? '' '' Age. '' '' Pooh ! What matter her years when she can carry them like thirty ? What an eye ! What an arm ! And besides , my friends , he is not himself a boy any longer . `` `` Ah , but that is another thing . `` `` A man 's age is an incident , a woman 's a calamity . `` `` Very true . But a young man consults his eye , and an older man his ear . Over forty , it is the clever tongue which wins ; under it , the pretty face . `` `` Ah , you rascal ! Then you have made up your mind that five-and-forty years with tact will hold the field against nine-and-thirty with beauty . Well , when your lady has won , she will doubtless remember who were the first to pay court to her . `` `` But I think that you are wrong , Racine . `` `` Well , we shall see . `` `` And if you are wrong -- - '' '' Well , what then ? `` `` Then it may be a little serious for you . `` `` And why ? `` `` The Marquise de Montespan has a memory . `` `` Her influence may soon be nothing more . `` `` Do not rely too much upon it , my friend . When the Fontanges came up from Provence , with her blue eyes and her copper hair , it was in every man 's mouth that Montespan had had her day . Yet Fontanges is six feet under a church crypt , and the marquise spent two hours with the king last week . She has won once , and may again . `` `` Ah , but this is a very different rival . This is no slip of a country girl , but the cleverest woman in France . `` `` Pshaw , Racine , you know our good master well , or you should , for you seem to have been at his elbow since the days of the Fronde . Is he a man , think you , to be amused forever by sermons , or to spend his days at the feet of a lady of that age , watching her at her tapestry-work , and fondling her poodle , when all the fairest faces and brightest eyes of France are as thick in hissalonsas the tulips in a Dutch flower-bed ? No , no , it will be the Montespan , or if not she , some younger beauty . `` `` My dear Boileau , I say again that her sun is setting . Have you not heard the news ? `` `` Not a word . `` `` Her brother , Monsieur de Vivonne , has been refused theentre . '' '' Impossible ! `` `` But it is a fact . `` `` And when ? `` `` This very morning . `` `` From whom had you it ? `` `` From De Catinat , the captain of the guard . He had his orders to bar the way to him. '' '' Ha ! then the king does indeed mean mischief . That is why his brow is so cloudy this morning , then . By my faith , if the marquise has the spirit with which folk credit her , he may find that it was easier to win her than to slight her . `` `` Ay ; the Mortemarts are no easy race to handle . `` `` Well , heaven send him a safe way out of it ! But who is this gentleman ? His face is somewhat grimmer than those to which the court is accustomed . Ha ! the king catches sight of him , and Louvois beckons to him to advance . By my faith , he is one who would be more at his ease in a tent than under a painted ceiling . `` The stranger who had attracted Racine 's attention was a tall thin man , with a high aquiline nose , stern fierce gray eyes , peeping out from under tufted brows , and a countenance so lined and marked by age , care , and stress of weather that it stood out amid the prim courtier faces which surrounded it as an old hawk might in a cage of birds of gay plumage . He was clad in a sombre-coloured suit which had become usual at court since the king had put aside frivolity and Fontanges , but the sword which hung from his waist was no fancy rapier , but a good brass-hilted blade in a stained leather-sheath , which showed every sign of having seen hard service . He had been standing near the door , his black-feathered beaver in his hand , glancing with a half-amused , half-disdainful expression at the groups of gossips around him , but at the sign from the minister of war he began to elbow his way forward , pushing aside in no very ceremonious fashion all who barred his passage.Louis possessed in a high degree the royal faculty of recognition . `` It is years since I have seen him , but I remember his face well , '' said he , turning to his minister . `` It is the Comte de Frontenac , is it not ? `` `` Yes , sire , '' answered Louvois ; `` it is indeed Louis de Buade , Comte deFrontenac , and formerly governor of Canada . `` `` We are glad to see you once more at ourlever , '' said the monarch , as the old nobleman stooped his head , and kissed the white hand which was extended to him . `` I hope that the cold of Canada has not chilled the warmth of your loyalty . `` `` Only death itself , sire , would be cold enough for that . `` `` Then I trust that it may remain to us for many long years . We would thank you for the care and pains which you have spent upon our province , and if we have recalled you , it is chiefly that we would fain hear from your own lips how all things go there . And first , as the affairs of God take precedence of those of France , how does the conversion of the heathen prosper ? `` `` We can not complain , sire . The good fathers , both Jesuits and Recollets , have done their best , though indeed they are both rather ready to abandon the affairs of the next world in order to meddle with those of this . `` `` What say you to that , father ? '' asked Louis , glancing , with a twinkle of the eyes , at his Jesuit confessor . `` I say , sire , that when the affairs of this world have a bearing upon those of the next , it is indeed the duty of a good priest , as of every other good Catholic , to guide them right . `` `` That is very true , sire , '' said De Frontenac , with an angry flush upon his swarthy cheek ; `` but as long as your Majesty did me the honour to intrust those affairs no my own guidance , I would brook no interference in the performance of my duties , whether the meddler were clad in coat or cassock . `` `` Enough , sir , enough ! '' said Louis sharply . `` I had asked you about the missions . `` `` They prosper , sire . There are Iroquois at the Sault and the mountain ,
