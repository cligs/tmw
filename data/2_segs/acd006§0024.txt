, my boy , '' he said at last brusquely . `` I 'm ready for anything , dad , '' replied Tom , `` but I do n't quite see whatI 'm fitted for . `` `` First of all , what do you think of this ? '' the doctor asked abruptly , handing a letter over to his son , who opened it and read as follows : -- - # # # # # `` DEAR SIR , -- - '' It has come to my knowledge through my son that your boy has abandoned the study of medicine , and that you are still uncertain as to his future career . I have long had the intention of seeking a young man who might join in our business , and relieve my old shoulders of some of the burden . Ezra urges me to write and propose that your son should become one of us . If he has any taste for business we shall be happy to advance his interest in every way . He would , of course , have to purchase a share in the concern , which would amount to seven thousand pounds , on which he would be paid interest at the rate of five per cent . By allowing this interest to accumulate , and investing also his share of the profits , he might in time absorb a large portion of the business . In case he joined us upon this footing we should have no objection to his name appearing as one of the firm . Should the idea commend itself to you , I should be most happy to talk over details , and to explain to you the advantages which the firm can offer , at my office in Fenchurch Street , any day between ten and four . `` `` With kind regards to your family , and hoping that they enjoy the great blessing of health , I remain sincerely yours , '' # # # # # `` JOHN GIRDLESTONE . `` `` What d 'ye think of that ? '' the doctor asked , when his son had finished reading it . `` I hardly know , '' said Tom ; `` I should like a little time to think it over . `` `` Seven thousand pounds is a good round sum . It is more than half the total capital which I have invested for you . On the other hand , I have heard those who ought to know say there is not a sounder or better managed concern in London . There 's no time like the present , Tom . Get your hat , and we 'll go down to Fenchurch Street together and look into it . `` While father and son were rattling along in a cab from Kensington to the City , the young man had time to turn the matter over in his mind . He wanted to be at work , and why not take this up as well as anything else . It is true that he disliked what he had seen of both the Girdlestones , but , on the other hand , by becoming a member of the firm he would probably be thrown in the way of meeting the old merchant 's ward . This last consideration decided the matter , and long before the cab had pulled up at the long and dirty passage which led to the offices of the great African firm , the party principally interested had fully made up his mind as to the course he should adopt.They were duly ushered into the small sanctum adorned with the dissected ships , the maps , the charts , the lists of sailing , and the water-colour picture of the barqueBelinda , where they were received by the head of the firm . With a charming personal modesty , tempered by a becoming pride in the great business which he had himself created , he discoursed upon its transactions and its importance . He took down ledgers and flashed great rows of figures before the eyes of the good doctor , explaining , at the same time , how month after month their receipts increased and their capital grew . Then he spoke touchingly of his own ripe years , and of the quiet and seclusion which he looked forward to after his busy lifetime . `` With my young friend here , '' he said , patting Tom affectionately on the shoulder , `` and my own boy Ezra , both working together , there will be young blood and life in the concern . They 'll bring the energy , and when they want advice they can come to the old man for it . I intend in a year or so , when the new arrangement works smoothly , to have a run over to Palestine . It may seem a weakness to you , but all my life I have hoped some day to stand upon that holy ground , and to look down on those scenes which we have all imagined to ourselves . Your son will start with a good position and a fair income , which he will probably double before he is five years older . The money invested by him is simply to ensure that he shall have a substantial interest in promoting the affairs of the firm . '' Thus the old man ran on , and when Tom and his father left the office with the sound of great sums of money , and huge profits , and heavy balances , and safe investments , all jostling each other in their brains , they had both made up their minds as to the future.Hence in a couple of days there was a stir in the legal house of Jones , Morgan , & Co. , with much rustling of parchment , and signing of names , and drinking of inferior sherry . The result of all which was that the firm of Girdlestone & Co. were seven thousand pounds the richer , and Thomas Dimsdale found himself a recognized member of a great commercial house with all the rights and privileges appertaining thereto . `` A good day 's work , Tom , '' said the old doctor , as they left the lawyer 's office together . `` You have now taken an irrevocable step in life , my boy . The world is before you . You belong to a first-class firm and you have every chance . May you thrive and prosper . `` `` If I do n't it wo n't be my fault , '' Tom answered with decision . `` I shall work with my whole heart and soul . `` `` A good day 's work , Ezra , '' the African merchant was remarking at that very moment in Fenchurch Street . `` The firm is pinched again for working expenses . This will help ; '' and he threw a little slip of green paper across the table to his son . `` It will help us for a time , '' Ezra said , gloomily , glancing at the figures . `` It was fortunate that I was able to put you on his track . It is only a drop in the ocean , however . Unless this diamond spec . comes off , nothing can save us . `` `` But it shall come off , '' his father answered resolutely . He had succeeded in obtaining an agent who appeared to be almost as well fitted for the post as the recalcitrant major . This worthy had started off already for Russia , where the scene of his operations was to lie . `` I hope so , '' said Ezra . `` We have neglected no precaution . Langworthy should be at Tobolsk by this time . I saw that he had a bag of rough stones with him which would do well enough for his purpose . `` `` We have your money ready , too . I can rely upon rather over thirty thousand pounds . Our credit was good for that , but I did not wish to push it too far for fear of setting tongues wagging . `` `` I am thinking of starting shortly in the mail boatCyprian , '' said Ezra . `` I should be at the diamond fields in little more than a month . I dare say Langworthy wo n't show any signs for some time yet , but I may as well be there as here . It will give me a little while to find my way about . You see , if the tidings and I were to come almost simultaneously , it might arouse suspicions . In the meantime , no one knows our little game . `` `` Except your friend Clutterbuck . `` A dark shadow passed over Ezra 's handsome face , and his cruel lip tightened in a way which boded little good to the old soldier should he ever lie at his mercy.It was a proud day for the ex-medical student when he first entered the counting-house of the African firm and realized that he was one of the governing powers in that busy establishment . Tom Dimsdale 's mind was an intensely practical one , and although he had found the study of science an irksome matter , he was able to throw himself into business with uncommon energy and devotion . The clerks soon found that the sunburnt , athletic-looking young man intended to be anything but a sleeping partner , and both they and old Gilray respected him accordingly.The latter had at first been inclined to resent the new arrangement as far as his gentle down-trodden nature could resent anything . Hitherto he had been the monarch of the counting-house in the absence of the Girdlestones , but now a higher desk had been erected in a more central portion of the room , and this was for the accommodation of the new comer . Gilray , after his thirty years of service , felt this usurpation of his rights very keenly ; but there was such a simple kindness about the invader , and he was so grateful for any assistance in his new duties , that the old clerk 's resentment soon melted away.A little incident occurred which strengthened this kindly feeling . It chanced that some few days after Tom 's first appearance in the office several of the clerks , who had not yet quite gauged what manner of man this young gentleman might be , took advantage of the absence of the Girdlestones to take a rise out of the manager . One of them , a great rawboned Scotchman , named McCalister , after one or two minor exhibitions of wit concluded by dropping a heavy ruler over the partition of the old man 's desk in such a way that it crashed down upon his head as he sat stooping over his writing . Tom , who had been watching the proceedings with a baleful eye , sprang off his stool and made across the office at the offender . McCalister seemed inclined for a moment to brazen it out , but there was a dangerous sling about Tom 's shoulders and a flush of honest indignation upon his face . `` I did n't mean to hurt him , '' said the Scotchman . `` Do n't hit him , sir ! '' cried the little manager . `` Beg his pardon , '' said Tom between his teeth . McCalister stammered out some lame apology , and the matter was ended . It revealed the new partner ,
