the brushwood screen in front of them . Still the one broad sheet of sunshine poured down between the two pines , but all else was as dim and as silent as a vast cathedral with pillars of wood and roof of leaf . Not a branch that creaked , nor a twig that snapped , nor any sound at all save the sharp barking of a fox somewhere in the heart of the forest . A thrill of excitement ran through the nerves of De Catinat . It was like one of those games of hide-and-seek which the court used to play , when Louis was in a sportive mood , among the oaks and yew hedges of Versailles . But the forfeit there was a carved fan , or a box of bonbons , and here it was death.Ten minutes passed and there was no sign of any living thing behind them . `` They are over in yonder thicket , '' whispered Du Lhut , nodding his head towards a dense clump of brushwood , two hundred paces away . `` Have you seen them ? '' '' No . `` `` How do you know , then ? `` `` I saw a squirrel come from his hole in the great white beech-tree yonder . He scuttled back again as if something had scared him . From his hole he can see down into that brushwood . `` `` Do you think that they know that we are here ? `` `` They can not see us . But they are suspicious . They fear a trap . `` `` Shall we rush for the brushwood ? `` `` They would pick two of us off , and be gone like shadows through the woods . No , we had best go on our way . `` `` But they will follow us . `` `` I hardly think that they will . We are four and they are only two , and they know now that we are on our guard and that we can pick up a trail as quickly as they can themselves . Get behind these trunks where they can not see us . So ! Now stoop until you are past the belt of alder bushes . We must push on fast now , for where there are two Iroquois there are likely to be two hundred not very far off . `` `` Thank God that I did not bring Adele ! '' cried De Catinat . `` Yes , monsieur , it is well for a man to make a comrade of his wife , but not on the borders of the Iroquois country , nor of any other Indian country either . `` `` You do not take your own wife with you when you travel , then ? '' asked the soldier . `` Yes , but I do not let her travel from village to village . She remains in the wigwam . `` `` Then you leave her behind ? `` `` On the contrary , she is always there to welcome me . By Saint Anne , I should be heavy-hearted if I came to any village between this and the Bluffs of the Illinois , and did not find my wife waiting to greet me . `` `` Then she must travel before you . `` Du Lhut laughed heartily , without , however , emitting a sound . `` A fresh village , a fresh wife , '' said he . `` But I never have more than one in each , for it is a shame for a Frenchman to set an evil example when the good fathers are spending their lives so freely in preaching virtue to them . Ah , here is the Ajidaumo Creek , where the Indians set the sturgeon nets . It is still seven miles to Poitou . `` `` We shall be there before nightfall , then ? `` `` I think that we had best wait for nightfall before we make our way in . Since the Iroquois scouts are out as far as this , it is likely that they lie thick round Poitou , and we may find the last step the worst unless we have a care , the more so if these two get in front of us to warn the others . '' He paused a moment with slanting head and sidelong ear . `` By Saint Anne , '' he muttered , `` we have not shaken them off . They are still upon our trail ! `` `` You hear them ? `` `` Yes , they are no great way from us . They will find that they have followed us once too often this time . Now , I will show you a little bit of woodcraft which may be new to you . Slip off your moccasins , monsieur . `` De Catinat pulled off his shoes as directed , and Du Lhut did the same . `` Put them on as if they were gloves , '' said the pioneer , and an instant later Ephraim Savage and Amos had their comrades ' shoes upon their hands . `` You can sling your muskets over your back . So ! Now down on all fours , bending yourselves double , with your hands pressing hard upon the earth . That is excellent . Two men can leave the trail of four ! Now come with me , monsieur . `` He flitted from tree to tree on a line which was parallel to , but a few yards distant from , that of their comrades . Then suddenly he crouched behind a bush and pulled De Catinat down beside him . `` They must pass us in a few minutes , '' he whispered . `` Do not fire if you can help it . '' Something gleamed in Du Lhut 's hand , and his comrade , glancing down , saw that he had drawn a keen little tomahawk from his belt . Again the mad wild thrill ran through the soldier 's blood , as he peered through the tangled branches and waited for whatever might come out of the dim silent aisles of tree-boles.And suddenly he saw something move . It flitted like a shadow from one trunk to the other so swiftly that De Catinat could not have told whether it were beast or human . And then again he saw it , and yet again , sometimes one shadow , sometimes two shadows , silent , furtive , like theloup-garouwith which his nurse had scared him in his childhood . Then for a few moments all was still once more , and then in an instant there crept out from among the bushes the most terrible-looking creature that ever walked the earth , an Iroquois chief upon the war-trail.He was a tall powerful man , and his bristle of scalp-locks and eagle feathers made him look a giant in the dim light , for a good eight feet lay between his beaded moccasin and the topmost plume of his headgear . One side of his face was painted in soot , ochre , and vermilion to resemble a dog , and the other half as a fowl , so that the front view was indescribably grotesque and strange . A belt of wampum was braced round his loin-cloth , and a dozen scalp-locks fluttered out as he moved from the fringe of his leggings . His head was sunk forward , his eyes gleamed with a sinister light , and his nostrils dilated and contracted like those of an excited animal . His gun was thrown forward , and he crept along with bended knees , peering , listening , pausing , hurrying on , a breathing image of caution . Two paces behind him walked a lad of fourteen , clad and armed in the same fashion , but without the painted face and without the horrid dried trophies upon the leggings . It was his first campaign , and already his eyes shone and his nostrils twitched with the same lust for murder which burned within his elder . So they advanced , silent , terrible , creeping out of the shadows of the wood , as their race had come out of the shadows of history , with bodies of iron and tiger souls.They were just abreast of the bush when something caught the eye of the younger warrior , some displaced twig or fluttering leaf , and he paused with suspicion in every feature . Another instant and he had warned his companion , but Du Lhut sprang out and buried his little hatchet in the skull of the older warrior . De Catinat heard a dull crash , as when an axe splinters its way into a rotten tree , and the man fell like a log , laughing horribly , and kicking and striking with his powerful limbs . The younger warrior sprang like a deer over his fallen comrade and dashed on into the wood , but an instant later there was a gunshot among the trees in front , followed by a faint wailing cry . `` That is his death-whoop , '' said Du Lhut composedly . `` It was a pity to fire , and yet it was better than letting him go . `` As he spoke the two others came back , Ephraim ramming a fresh charge into his musket . `` Who was laughing ? '' asked Amos . `` It was he , '' said Du Lhut , nodding towards the dying warrior , who lay with his head in a horrible puddle , and his grotesque features contorted into a fixed smile . `` It 's a custom they have when they get their death-blow . I 've known a Seneca chief laugh for six hours on end at the torture-stake . Ah , he 's gone ! `` As he spoke the Indian gave a last spasm with his hands and feet , and lay rigid , grinning up at the slit of blue sky above him . `` He 's a great chief , '' said Du Lhut . `` He is Brown Moose of the Mohawks , and the other is his second son . We have drawn first blood , but I do not think that it will be the last , for the Iroquois do not allow their war-chiefs to die unavenged . He was a mighty fighter , as you may see by looking at his neck . `` He wore a peculiar necklace which seemed to De Catinat to consist of blackened bean pods set upon a string . As he stooped over it he saw to his horror that they were not bean pods , but withered human fingers . `` They are all right fore-fingers , '' said Du Lhut , `` so everyone represents a life . There are forty-two in all . Eighteen are of men whom he has slain in battle , and the other twenty-four have been taken and tortured . `` `` How do you know that ? `` `` Because only eighteen have their nails on . If the prisoner of an Iroquois be alive , he begins always by biting his nails off . You see that they are missing from four-and-twenty . `` De Catinat shuddered . What demons were these amongst whom an evil fate had drifted him ? And was it possible that his Adele should fall into the hands of such fiends ? No , no , surely the good God , for whose sake they had suffered so much , would not permit such an infamy ! And yet as evil
