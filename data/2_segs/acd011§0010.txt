. Then , with a bow , she swept from the room . `` She 's a beautiful woman -- -a very beautiful woman , '' said MacDonald thoughtfully , after the door had closed behind her . `` This man Barker has certainly been down here a good deal . He is a man who might be attractive to a woman . He admits that the dead man was jealous , and maybe he knew best himself what cause he had for jealousy . Then there 's that wedding ring . You ca n't get past that . The man who tears a wedding ring off a dead man 's -- -What do you say to it , Mr . Holmes ? `` My friend had sat with his head upon his hands , sunk in the deepest thought . Now he rose and rang the bell . `` Ames , '' he said , when the butler entered , `` where is Mr. Cecil Barker now ? `` `` I 'll see , sir . `` He came back in a moment to say that Barker was in the garden . `` Can you remember , Ames , what Mr. Barker had on his feet last night when you joined him in the study ? `` `` Yes , Mr. Holmes . He had a pair of bedroom slippers . I brought him his boots when he went for the police . `` `` Where are the slippers now ? `` `` They are still under the chair in the hall . `` `` Very good , Ames . It is , of course , important for us to know which tracks may be Mr. Barker 's and which from outside . `` `` Yes , sir . I may say that I noticed that the slippers were stained with blood -- -so indeed were my own . `` `` That is natural enough , considering the condition of the room . Very good , Ames . We will ring if we want you . `` A few minutes later we were in the study . Holmes had brought with him the carpet slippers from the hall . As Ames had observed , the soles of both were dark with blood. '' Strange ! '' murmured Holmes , as he stood in the light of the window and examined them minutely . `` Very strange indeed ! `` Stooping with one of his quick feline pounces , he placed the slipper upon the blood mark on the sill . It exactly corresponded . He smiled in silence at his colleagues.The inspector was transfigured with excitement . His native accent rattled like a stick upon railings . `` Man , '' he cried , `` there 's not a doubt of it ! Barker has just marked the window himself . It 's a good deal broader than any bootmark . I mind that you said it was a splay-foot , and here 's the explanation . But what 's the game , Mr. Holmes -- -what 's the game ? `` `` Ay , what 's the game ? '' my friend repeated thoughtfully.White Mason chuckled and rubbed his fat hands together in his professional satisfaction . `` I said it was a snorter ! '' he cried . `` And a real snorter it is ! `` The three detectives had many matters of detail into which to inquire ; so I returned alone to our modest quarters at the village inn . But before doing so I took a stroll in the curious old-world garden which flanked the house . Rows of very ancient yew trees cut into strange designs girded it round . Inside was a beautiful stretch of lawn with an old sundial in the middle , the whole effect so soothing and restful that it was welcome to my somewhat jangled nerves.In that deeply peaceful atmosphere one could forget , or remember only as some fantastic nightmare , that darkened study with the sprawling , bloodstained figure on the floor . And yet , as I strolled round it and tried to steep my soul in its gentle balm , a strange incident occurred , which brought me back to the tragedy and left a sinister impression in my mind.I have said that a decoration of yew trees circled the garden . At the end farthest from the house they thickened into a continuous hedge . On the other side of this hedge , concealed from the eyes of anyone approaching from the direction of the house , there was a stone seat . As I approached the spot I was aware of voices , some remark in the deep tones of a man , answered by a little ripple of feminine laughter.An instant later I had come round the end of the hedge and my eyes lit upon Mrs. Douglas and the man Barker before they were aware of my presence . Her appearance gave me a shock . In the dining-room she had been demure and discreet . Now all pretense of grief had passed away from her . Her eyes shone with the joy of living , and her face still quivered with amusement at some remark of her companion . He sat forward , his hands clasped and his forearms on his knees , with an answering smile upon his bold , handsome face . In an instant -- -but it was just one instant too late -- -they resumed their solemn masks as my figure came into view . A hurried word or two passed between them , and then Barker rose and came towards me . `` Excuse me , sir , '' said he , `` but am I addressing Dr . Watson ? `` I bowed with a coldness which showed , I dare say , very plainly the impression which had been produced upon my mind . `` We thought that it was probably you , as your friendship with Mr. Sherlock Holmes is so well known . Would you mind coming over and speaking to Mrs. Douglas for one instant ? `` I followed him with a dour face . Very clearly I could see in my mind 's eye that shattered figure on the floor . Here within a few hours of the tragedy were his wife and his nearest friend laughing together behind a bush in the garden which had been his . I greeted the lady with reserve . I had grieved with her grief in the dining room . Now I met her appealing gaze with an unresponsive eye . `` I fear that you think me callous and hard-hearted , '' said she.I shrugged my shoulders . `` It is no business of mine , '' said I . `` Perhaps some day you will do me justice . If you only realized -- - '' '' There is no need why Dr. Watson should realize , '' said Barker quickly . `` As he has himself said , it is no possible business of his . `` `` Exactly , '' said I , `` and so I will beg leave to resume my walk . `` `` One moment , Dr. Watson , '' cried the woman in a pleading voice . `` There is one question which you can answer with more authority than anyone else in the world , and it may make a very great difference to me . You know Mr. Holmes and his relations with the police better than anyone else can . Supposing that a matter were brought confidentially to his knowledge , is it absolutely necessary that he should pass it on to the detectives ? `` `` Yes , that 's it , '' said Barker eagerly . `` Is he on his own or is he entirely in with them ? `` `` I really do n't know that I should be justified in discussing such a point . `` `` I beg -- -I implore that you will , Dr. Watson ! I assure you that you will be helping us -- -helping me greatly if you will guide us on that point . `` There was such a ring of sincerity in the woman 's voice that for the instant I forgot all about her levity and was moved only to do her will. '' Mr . Holmes is an independent investigator , '' I said . `` He is his own master , and would act as his own judgment directed . At the same time , he would naturally feel loyalty towards the officials who were working on the same case , and he would not conceal from them anything which would help them in bringing a criminal to justice . Beyond this I can say nothing , and I would refer you to Mr. Holmes himself if you wanted fuller information . `` So saying I raised my hat and went upon my way , leaving them still seated behind that concealing hedge . I looked back as I rounded the far end of it , and saw that they were still talking very earnestly together , and , as they were gazing after me , it was clear that it was our interview that was the subject of their debate . `` I wish none of their confidences , '' said Holmes , when I reported to him what had occurred . He had spent the whole afternoon at the Manor House in consultation with his two colleagues , and returned about five with a ravenous appetite for a high tea which I had ordered for him . `` No confidences , Watson ; for they are mighty awkward if it comes to an arrest for conspiracy and murder . `` `` You think it will come to that ? `` He was in his most cheerful and debonair humour . `` My dear Watson , when I have exterminated that fourth egg I shall be ready to put you in touch with the whole situation . I do n't say that we have fathomed it -- -far from it -- -but when we have traced the missing dumb-bell -- - '' '' The dumb-bell ! `` `` Dear me , Watson , is it possible that you have not penetrated the fact that the case hangs upon the missing dumb-bell ? Well , well , you need not be downcast ; for between ourselves I do n't think that either Inspector Mac or the excellent local practitioner has grasped the overwhelming importance of this incident . One dumb-bell , Watson ! Consider an athlete with one dumb-bell ! Picture to yourself the unilateral development , the imminent danger of a spinal curvature . Shocking , Watson , shocking ! `` He sat with his mouth full of toast and his eyes sparkling with mischief , watching my intellectual entanglement . The mere sight of his excellent appetite was an assurance of success ; for I had very clear recollections of days and nights without a thought of food , when his baffled mind had chafed before some problem while his thin , eager features became more attenuated with the asceticism of complete mental concentration . Finally he lit his pipe , and sitting in the inglenook of the old village inn he talked slowly and at random about his case , rather as one who thinks aloud than as one who makes a considered statement . `` A lie , Watson -- -a great , big , thumping , obtrusive , uncompromising lie -- -that 's what meets us on the threshold ! There is our starting point . The whole story told by Barker is a lie . But Barker 's story is corroborated by Mrs. Douglas . Therefore
