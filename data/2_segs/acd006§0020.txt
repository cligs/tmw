was a large and substantial house in a district which the wave of fashion had passed over in its westward course . It might still , however , be said to be covered by a deposit of eminent respectability . The building was stern and hard , and massive in its external appearance , but the interior was luxury itself , for the old merchant , in spite of his ascetic appearance , was inclined to be a sybarite at heart , and had a due appreciation of the good things of this world . Indeed , there was an oriental and almost barbarous splendour about the great rooms , where the richest of furniture was interspersed with skins from the Gaboon , hand-worked ivory from Old Calabar , and the thousand other strange valuables which were presented by his agents to the African trader.After the death of his friend , Girdlestone had been as good as his word . He had taken Kate Harston away from the desolate house at Fulham and brought her to live with him . From the garrets of that palatial edifice to the cellars she was at liberty to roam where she would , and do what she chose . The square garden too , with its smoke-dried trees and faded lawn , was at her disposal , in which she might walk , or work , or read . No cares or responsibilities were imposed upon her . The domestic affairs were superintended by a stern housekeeper , who bore a quaint resemblance to Girdlestone himself in petticoats , and who arranged every detail of housekeeping . The young girl had apparently only to exist and to be happy.Yet the latter item was not so easy as it might seem . It was not a congenial atmosphere . Her whole society consisted of the stern , unemotional merchant and his vulgar , occasionally brutal , son . At first , while the memory of her father was still fresh , she felt her new surroundings acutely , contrasting , as they did , with her happy Fulham home . Gradually , however , as time deadened the sting , she came to accommodate herself to circumstances . The two men left her very much to her own devices . Girdlestone was so engrossed in his business that he had little time to inquire into her pursuits , and Ezra , being addicted to late hours , was seldom seen except at breakfast-time , when she listened with awe to his sporting slang and cynical comments upon men and manners.John Girdlestone had been by no means overjoyed upon the return of the Dimsdales from Edinburgh to learn that his ward had been thrown into the company of her young cousin . He received her coldly and forbade her to visit Phillimore Gardens for some time to come . He took occasion also to speak of Tom , and to assure her that he had received very serious accounts as to his spiritual state . `` He is addicted to all manner of debasing pursuits , '' he remarked , `` and it is my particular wish that you should avoid him . '' Learning that young Dimsdale was in London , he even took the precaution of telling off a confidential footman to walk behind her on all occasions , and to act either as an escort or as a sentry.It chanced , however , that one day , a few weeks after her return , Kate found an opportunity of recovering her freedom . The footman had been despatched upon some other duty , so she bethought herself that a book was to be bought and some lace to be matched , and several other important feminine duties to be fulfilled . It happened , however , that as she walked sedately down Warwick Street , her eyes fell upon a very tall and square-shouldered young man , who was lounging in her direction , tapping his stick listlessly against the railings , as is the habit of idle men . At this Kate forgot incontinently all about the book and the lace , while the tall youth ceased to tap the railings , and came striding towards her with long springy footsteps and a smiling face . `` Why Cousin Tom , who would have thought of meeting you here ? '' she exclaimed , when the first greetings had been exchanged . `` It is a most surprising thing . `` It is possible that the incident would not have struck her as so very astonishing after all , had she known that Tom had spent six hours a day for the last fortnight in blockading the entrances to Eccleston Square . `` Most remarkable ! '' said the young hypocrite . `` You see , I have n't anything to do yet , so I walk about London a good deal . It was a lucky chance that sent me in this direction . `` `` And how is the doctor ? '' Kate asked eagerly . `` And Mrs. Dimsdale , how is she ? You must give my love to them both . `` `` How is it that you have never been to see us ? '' Tom asked reproachfully. '' Mr . Girdlestone thinks that I have been too idle lately , and that I should stay at home . I am afraid it will be some little time before I can steal away to Kensington . `` Tom consigned her guardian under his breath to a region warmer even than the scene of that gentleman 's commercial speculations . `` Which way are you going ? '' he asked . `` I was going to Victoria Street to change my book , and then to FordStreet . `` `` What a strange thing ! '' the young man exclaimed ; `` I was going in that direction too . '' It seemed the more strange , as he was walking in the opposite direction when she met him . Neither seemed inclined to make any comment upon the fact , so they walked on together . `` And you have not forgotten the days in Edinburgh yet ? '' Tom asked , after a long pause . `` No , indeed , '' his companion answered with enthusiasm . `` I shall never forget them as long as I live . `` `` Nor I , '' said Tom earnestly . `` You remember the day we had at thePentlands ? `` `` And the drive round Arthur 's Seat . `` `` And the time that we all went to Roslin and saw the chapel . `` `` And the day at Edinburgh Castle when we saw the jewels and the armoury . But you must have seen all these things many times before ? You could not have enjoyed it as much as we did for the first time . `` `` Oh yes , I did , '' Tom said stoutly , wondering to himself how it was that the easy grace with which he could turn compliments to maidens for whom he cared nothing had so entirely deserted him . `` You see , Kate-well -- -you were not there when I saw them before . `` `` Ah , '' said Kate demurely , `` what a beautiful day it is ? I fancied in the morning that it was going to rain . `` Tom was not to be diverted from his subject by any meteorological observations . `` Perhaps some time your guardian will allow the dad to take you on another little holiday , '' he said hopefully . `` I 'm afraid he wo n't , '' answered Kate . `` Why not ? `` `` Because he seemed so cross when I came back this last time . `` `` Why was he cross ? '' asked Tom . `` Because -- - '' She was about to say that it was because she had been brought in contact with him ; but she recollected herself in time . `` Because what ? `` `` Because he happened to be in a bad temper , '' she answered . `` It is too bad that you should have to submit to any one 's whims and tempers , '' the young man said , switching his stick angrily backwards and forwards . `` Why not ? '' she asked , laughing . `` Everybody has some one over them.If you had n't , you would never know right from wrong . `` `` But he is unkind to you . `` `` No , indeed , '' said Kate , with decision . `` He is really very kind to me . He may appear a little stern at times , but I know that he means it for my own good , and I should be a very foolish girl if I resented it . Besides , he is so pious and good that what may seem a little fault to us would appear a great thing in his eyes . `` `` Oh , he is very pious and good , then , '' Tom remarked , in a doubtful voice . His shrewd old father had formed his own views as to John Girdlestone 's character , and his son had in due course imbibed them from him . `` Yes , of course he is , '' answered Kate , looking up with great wondering eyes . `` Do n't you know that he is the chief supporter of the Purbrook Street Branch of the Primitive Trinitarians , and sits in the front pew three times every Sunday ? '' '' Ah ! '' said Tom . `` Yes , and subscribes to all the charitable funds , and is a friend of Mr. Jefferson Edwards , the great philanthropist . Besides , look how good he has been to me . He has taken the place of my father. '' '' Hum ! '' Tom said dubiously ; and then , with a little pang at his heart , '' Do you like Ezra Girdlestone too ? `` `` No , indeed , '' cried his companion with energy . `` I do n't like him in the least . He is a cruel , bad-hearted man. '' '' Cruel ! You do n't mean cruel to you , of course . `` `` No , not to me . I avoid him as much as I can , and sometimes for weeks we hardly exchange a word . Do you know what he did the other day ? It makes me shudder even to think of it . I heard a cat crying pitifully in the garden , so I went out to see what was the matter . When I got outside I saw Ezra Girdlestone leaning out of a window with a gun in his hands -- -one of those air-guns which do n't make any noise when they go off . And there , in the middle of the garden , was a poor cat that he had tied to a bush , and he had been practising at it for ever so long . The poor creature was still alive , but oh ! so dreadfully injured . `` `` The brute ! What did you do ? `` `` I untied it and brought it inside , but it died during the night . `` `` And what did he say ? `` `` He put up his gun while I was untying it , as if he had half a mind to take a shot at me . When I met him afterwards he said that he would teach me to mind my
