interests . `` `` You have told lies in order to turn me away from the only man who ever loved me . You and your odious son have conspired to ruin my happiness and break my heart . What have you told him that keeps him away ? I shall see him and learn the truth . '' Kate 's face was unnaturally calm and rigid as she faced her guardian 's angry gaze. '' Silence ! '' the old man cried hoarsely . `` You forget your position in this house . You are presuming too much upon my kindness . As to this girl 's fancy of yours , you may put all thought of it out of your head . I am still your guardian , and I should be culpably remiss if I ever allowed you to see this man again . This afternoon you shall come with me to Hampshire . `` `` To Hampshire ? '' '' Yes . I have taken a small country seat there , where we intend to spend some months of the winter . You shall leave it when you have reconciled yourself to forget these romantic ideas of yours -- -but not till then . `` `` Then I shall never leave it , '' said Kate , with a sigh . `` That will depend upon yourself . You shall at least be guarded there from the advances of designing persons . When you come of age you may follow your own fancies . Until then my conscience demands , and the law allows , that I should spare no pains to protect you from your own folly . We start from Waterloo at four . '' Girdlestone turned for the door , but looked round as he was leaving the room . `` May God forgive you , '' he said solemnly , raising his lean hands towards the ceiling , `` for what you have done this day ! `` Poor Kate , left to herself , was much concerned by this fresh misfortune . She knew that her guardian had power to carry out his plan , and that there was no appeal from his decision . What could she do ? She had not a friend in the wide world to whom she could turn for advice or assistance . It occurred to her to fly to the Dimsdales at Kensington , and throw herself upon their compassion . It was only the thought of Tom which prevented her . In her heart she had fully exonerated him , yet there was much to be explained before they could be to each other as of old . She might write to Mrs. Dimsdale , but then her guardian had not told her what part of Hampshire they were going to . She finally came to the conclusion that it would be better to wait , and to write when she had reached her destination . In the meantime , she went drearily to her room and began packing , aided by the ruddy-cheeked maid , Rebecca.At half-past three a cab drove up to the door , and the old merchant stepped out of it . The boxes were thrown upon the top , and the young lady curtly ordered to get in . Girdlestone took his seat beside her , and gave a sign to the cabman to drive on . As they rattled out of the square , Kate looked back at the great gloomy mansion in which she had spent the last three years of her life . Had she known what the future was to bring , it is possible that she would have clung even to that sombre and melancholy old house as to an ark of safety.Another cab passed through Eccleston Square that evening -- -a cab which bore a pale-faced and wild-eyed young man , who looked ever and anon impatiently out of the window to see if he were nearing his destination . Long before reaching No . 69 he had opened the door , and was standing upon the step . The instant that the cab pulled up he sprang off , and rang loudly at the great brass bell which flanked the heavy door . `` Is Mr. Girdlestone in ? '' he asked , as Rebecca appeared at the door . `` No , sir . `` `` Miss Harston , is she at home ? '' he said excitedly . `` No , sir . They have both gone away . `` `` Gone away ! '' '' Yes . Gone into the country , sir . And Mr. Ezra , too , sir . `` `` And when are they coming back ? '' he asked , in bewilderment . `` They are not coming back. '' '' Impossible ! '' Tom cried in despair . `` What is their address , then ? `` `` They have left no address . I am sorry I ca n't help you . Good night , sir . '' Rebecca closed the door , laughing maliciously at the visitor 's bewildered looks . She knew the facts of the case well , and having long been jealous of her young mistress , she was not sorry to find things going wrong with her.Tom Dimsdale stood upon the doorstep looking blankly into the night . He felt dazed and bewildered . What fresh villainy was this ? Was it a confirmation of the German 's report , or was it a contradiction of it ? Cold beads stood upon his forehead as he thought of the possibility of such a thing . `` I must find her , '' he cried , with clenched hands , and turned away heartsick into the turmoil and bustle of the London streets.Rebecca , the fresh-complexioned waiting-maid , was still standing behind the ponderous hall door , listening , with a smile upon her face , to young Dimsdale 's retreating footsteps , when another and a brisker tread caught her ear coming from the opposite direction . The smile died away as she heard it , and her features assumed a peculiar expression , in which it would be hard to say whether fear or pleasure predominated . She passed her hands up over her face and smoothed her hair with a quick nervous gesture , glancing down at the same time at her snowy apron and the bright ribbons which set it off . Whatever her intentions may have been , she had no time to improve upon her toilet before a key turned in the door and Ezra Girdlestone stepped into the hall . As he saw her shadowy figure , for the gas was low , he uttered a hoarse cry of surprise and fear , and staggered backwards against the door-post . `` Do n't be afeared , Mister Ezra , '' she said in a whisper ; `` it 's only me . `` `` The devil take you ! '' cried Ezra furiously . `` What makes you stand about like that ? You gave me quite a turn . `` `` I did n't mean for to do it . I 've only just been answering of the door . Why , surely you 've come in before now and found me in the hall without making much account of it . `` `` Ah , lass , '' answered Ezra , `` my nerves have had a shake of late.I 've felt queer all day . Look how my hand shakes . `` `` Well , I 'm blessed ! '' said the girl , with a titter , turning up the gas . `` I never thought to see you afeared of anything . Why , you looks as white as a sheet ! `` `` There , that 's enough ! '' he answered roughly . `` Where are the others ? `` `` Jane is out . Cook and William and the boy are downstairs . `` `` Come into the library here . They will think that you are up in the bedrooms . I want to have a quiet word or two with you . Turn up that reading lamp . Well , are they gone ? `` `` Yes , they are gone , '' she answered , standing by the side of the couch on which he had thrown himself . `` Your father came about three with a cab , and took her away . `` `` She did n't make a fuss ? `` `` Make a fuss ? No ; why should she ? There 's fuss enough made about her , in all conscience . Oh , Ezra , before she got between us you was kind to me at times . I could stand harsh words from you six days a week , if there was a chance of a kind one on the seventh . But now -- -now what notice do you take of me ? '' She began to whimper and to wipe her eyes with a little discoloured pocket-handkerchief . `` Drop it , woman , drop it ! '' cried her companion testily . `` I want information , not snivelling . She seemed reconciled to go ? `` `` Yes , she went quiet enough , '' the girl said , with a furtive sob . `` Just give me a drop of brandy out of that bottle over there -- -the one with the cork half out . I 've not got over my start yet . Did you hear my father say anything as to where they were going ? `` `` I heard him tell the cabman to drive to Waterloo Station . `` `` Nothing more ? '' '' No . `` `` Well , if he wo n't tell you , I will . They have gone down to Hampshire , my lass . Bedsworth is the name of the place , and it is a pleasant little corner near the sea . I want you to go down there as well to-morrow . `` `` Want me to go ? `` `` Yes ; they need some one who is smart and handy to keep house for them.There is some old woman already , I believe , but she is old and useless.I 'll warrant you would n't take long getting things shipshape . My fatherintends to stay down there some little time with Miss Harston . `` `` And how about you ? '' the girl asked , with a quick flash of suspicion in her dark eyes . `` Do n't trouble about me . I shall stay behind and mind the business . Some one must be on the spot . I think cook and Jane and William ought to be able to look after me among them . `` `` And I wo n't see you at all ? '' the girl cried , with a quiver in her voice . `` Oh yes , you shall . I 'll be down from Saturday to Monday every week , and perhaps oftener . If business goes well I may come down and stay for some time . Whether I do or not may depend upon you . `` Rebecca Taylforth started and uttered an exclamation of surprise . `` How can it depend upon me ? '' she asked eagerly . `` Well , '' said Ezra , in a hesitating way , `` it may depend upon whether you are a good girl , and do what you are told or not . I am sure that you would do anything to serve me , would you not ? `` `` You know very well that I would ,
