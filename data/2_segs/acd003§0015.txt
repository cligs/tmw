, and a coarse red scarf round his neck . `` I am off down the river , Watson , '' said he . `` I have been turning it over in my mind , and I can see only one way out of it . It is worth trying , at all events . `` `` Surely I can come with you , then ? '' said I . `` No ; you can be much more useful if you will remain here as my representative . I am loath to go , for it is quite on the cards that some message may come during the day , though Wiggins was despondent about it last night . I want you to open all notes and telegrams , and to act on your own judgment if any news should come . Can I rely upon you ? `` `` Most certainly . `` `` I am afraid that you will not be able to wire to me , for I can hardly tell yet where I may find myself . If I am in luck , however , I may not be gone so very long . I shall have news of some sort or other before I get back . `` I had heard nothing of him by breakfast-time . On opening the Standard , however , I found that there was a fresh allusion to the business . `` With reference to the Upper Norwood tragedy , '' it remarked , `` we have reason to believe that the matter promises to be even more complex and mysterious than was originally supposed . Fresh evidence has shown that it is quite impossible that Mr. Thaddeus Sholto could have been in any way concerned in the matter . He and the housekeeper , Mrs. Bernstone , were both released yesterday evening . It is believed , however , that the police have a clue as to the real culprits , and that it is being prosecuted by Mr. Athelney Jones , of Scotland Yard , with all his well-known energy and sagacity . Further arrests may be expected at any moment . `` `` That is satisfactory so far as it goes , '' thought I . `` Friend Sholto is safe , at any rate . I wonder what the fresh clue may be ; though it seems to be a stereotyped form whenever the police have made a blunder . `` I tossed the paper down upon the table , but at that moment my eye caught an advertisement in the agony column . It ran in this way : '' Lost. -- -Whereas Mordecai Smith , boatman , and his son , Jim , left Smith 's Wharf at or about three o'clock last Tuesday morning in the steam launch Aurora , black with two red stripes , funnel black with a white band , the sum of five pounds will be paid to any one who can give information to Mrs. Smith , at Smith 's Wharf , or at 221b Baker Street , as to the whereabouts of the said Mordecai Smith and the launch Aurora . `` This was clearly Holmes 's doing . The Baker Street address was enough to prove that . It struck me as rather ingenious , because it might be read by the fugitives without their seeing in it more than the natural anxiety of a wife for her missing husband.It was a long day . Every time that a knock came to the door , or a sharp step passed in the street , I imagined that it was either Holmes returning or an answer to his advertisement . I tried to read , but my thoughts would wander off to our strange quest and to the ill-assorted and villainous pair whom we were pursuing . Could there be , I wondered , some radical flaw in my companion 's reasoning . Might he be suffering from some huge self-deception ? Was it not possible that his nimble and speculative mind had built up this wild theory upon faulty premises ? I had never known him to be wrong ; and yet the keenest reasoner may occasionally be deceived . He was likely , I thought , to fall into error through the over-refinement of his logic , -- -his preference for a subtle and bizarre explanation when a plainer and more commonplace one lay ready to his hand . Yet , on the other hand , I had myself seen the evidence , and I had heard the reasons for his deductions . When I looked back on the long chain of curious circumstances , many of them trivial in themselves , but all tending in the same direction , I could not disguise from myself that even if Holmes 's explanation were incorrect the true theory must be equally outre and startling.At three o'clock in the afternoon there was a loud peal at the bell , an authoritative voice in the hall , and , to my surprise , no less a person than Mr. Athelney Jones was shown up to me . Very different was he , however , from the brusque and masterful professor of common sense who had taken over the case so confidently at Upper Norwood . His expression was downcast , and his bearing meek and even apologetic . `` Good-day , sir ; good-day , '' said he . `` Mr. Sherlock Holmes is out , I understand . `` `` Yes , and I can not be sure when he will be back . But perhaps you would care to wait . Take that chair and try one of these cigars . `` `` Thank you ; I do n't mind if I do , '' said he , mopping his face with a red bandanna handkerchief . `` And a whiskey-and-soda ? `` `` Well , half a glass . It is very hot for the time of year ; and I have had a good deal to worry and try me . You know my theory about this Norwood case ? `` `` I remember that you expressed one . `` `` Well , I have been obliged to reconsider it . I had my net drawn tightly round Mr. Sholto , sir , when pop he went through a hole in the middle of it . He was able to prove an alibi which could not be shaken . From the time that he left his brother 's room he was never out of sight of some one or other . So it could not be he who climbed over roofs and through trap-doors . It 's a very dark case , and my professional credit is at stake . I should be very glad of a little assistance . `` `` We all need help sometimes , '' said I . `` Your friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes is a wonderful man , sir , '' said he , in a husky and confidential voice . `` He 's a man who is not to be beat . I have known that young man go into a good many cases , but I never saw the case yet that he could not throw a light upon . He is irregular in his methods , and a little quick perhaps in jumping at theories , but , on the whole , I think he would have made a most promising officer , and I do n't care who knows it . I have had a wire from him this morning , by which I understand that he has got some clue to this Sholto business . Here is the message . `` He took the telegram out of his pocket , and handed it to me . It was dated from Poplar at twelve o'clock . `` Go to Baker Street at once , '' it said . `` If I have not returned , wait for me . I am close on the track of the Sholto gang . You can come with us to-night if you want to be in at the finish . `` `` This sounds well . He has evidently picked up the scent again , '' said I . `` Ah , then he has been at fault too , '' exclaimed Jones , with evident satisfaction . `` Even the best of us are thrown off sometimes . Of course this may prove to be a false alarm ; but it is my duty as an officer of the law to allow no chance to slip . But there is some one at the door . Perhaps this is he . `` A heavy step was heard ascending the stair , with a great wheezing and rattling as from a man who was sorely put to it for breath . Once or twice he stopped , as though the climb were too much for him , but at last he made his way to our door and entered . His appearance corresponded to the sounds which we had heard . He was an aged man , clad in seafaring garb , with an old pea-jacket buttoned up to his throat . His back was bowed , his knees were shaky , and his breathing was painfully asthmatic . As he leaned upon a thick oaken cudgel his shoulders heaved in the effort to draw the air into his lungs . He had a colored scarf round his chin , and I could see little of his face save a pair of keen dark eyes , overhung by bushy white brows , and long gray side-whiskers . Altogether he gave me the impression of a respectable master mariner who had fallen into years and poverty . `` What is it , my man ? '' I asked.He looked about him in the slow methodical fashion of old age . `` Is Mr. Sherlock Holmes here ? '' said he . `` No ; but I am acting for him . You can tell me any message you have for him . `` `` It was to him himself I was to tell it , '' said he . `` But I tell you that I am acting for him . Was it about Mordecai Smith 's boat ? '' '' Yes . I knows well where it is . An ' I knows where the men he is after are . An ' I knows where the treasure is . I knows all about it . `` `` Then tell me , and I shall let him know . `` `` It was to him I was to tell it , '' he repeated , with the petulant obstinacy of a very old man . `` Well , you must wait for him . `` `` No , no ; I ai n't goin ' to lose a whole day to please no one . If Mr. Holmes ai n't here , then Mr. Holmes must find it all out for himself . I do n't care about the look of either of you , and I wo n't tell a word . `` He shuffled towards the door , but Athelney Jones got in front of him . `` Wait a bit , my friend , '' said he . `` You have important information , and you must not walk off . We shall keep you , whether you like or not , until our friend returns . `` The old man made a little run towards the door , but , as Athelney Jones put his broad back up against it , he recognized the uselessness of resistance . `` Pretty sort o ' treatment this ! '' he cried , stamping his stick . ``
