, but her presence weighed him down with fear , for he knew that while Nature had made these woods a heaven , man had changed it into a hell , and that a nameless horror lurked behind all the beauty of the fading leaves and of the woodland flowers . Often as he lay at night beside the smouldering fire upon his couch of spruce , and looked at the little figure muffled in the blanket and slumbering peacefully by his side , he felt that he had no right to expose her to such peril , and that in the morning they should turn the canoe eastward again and take what fate might bring them at Quebec . But ever with the daybreak there came the thought of the humiliation , the dreary homeward voyage , the separation which would await them in galley and dungeon , to turn him from his purpose.On the seventh day they rested at a point but a few miles from the mouth of the Richelieu River , where a large blockhouse , Fort Richelieu , had been built by M. de Saurel . Once past this they had no great distance to go to reach the seigneury of De Catinat 's friend of thenoblessewho would help them upon their way . They had spent the night upon a little island in midstream , and at early dawn they were about to thrust the canoe out again from the sand-lined cove in which she lay , when Ephraim Savage growled in his throat and pointed Out across the water.A large canoe was coming up the river , flying along as quick as a dozen arms could drive it . In the stern sat a dark figure which bent forward with every swing of the paddles , as though consumed by eagerness to push onwards . Even at that distance there was no mistaking it . It was the fanatical monk whom they had left behind them.Concealed among the brushwood , they watched their pursuers fly past and vanish round a curve in the stream . Then they looked at one another in perplexity . `` We 'd have done better either to put him overboard or to take him as ballast , '' said Ephraim . `` He 's hull down in front of us now , and drawing full . `` `` Well , we ca n't take the back track anyhow , '' remarked Amos . `` And yet how can we go on ? '' said De Catinat despondently . `` This vindictive devil will give word at the fort and at every other point along the river . He has been back to Quebec . It is one of the governor 's own canoes , and goes three paces to our two . `` `` Let me cipher it out . '' Amos Green sat on a fallen maple with his head sunk upon his hands . `` Well , '' said he presently , `` if it 's no good going on , and no good going back , there 's only one way , and that is to go to one side . That 's so , Ephraim , is it not ? `` `` Ay , ay , lad , if you ca n't run you must tack , but it seems shoal water on either bow . `` `` We ca n't go to the north , so it follows that we must go to the south . `` `` Leave the canoe ? `` `` It 's our only chance . We can cut through the woods and come out near this friendly house on the Richelieu . The friar will lose our trail then , and we 'll have no more trouble with him , if he stays on the St . Lawrence . `` `` There 's nothing else for it , '' said Captain Ephraim ruefully . `` It 's not my way to go by land if I can get by water , and I have not been a fathom deep in a wood since King Philip came down on the province , so you must lay the course and keep her straight , Amos . `` `` It is not far , and it will not take us long . Let us get over to the southern bank and we shall make a start . If madame tires , De Catinat , we shall take turns to carry her . `` `` Ah , monsieur , you can not think what a good walker I am . In this splendid air one might go on forever . `` `` We will cross then . `` In a very few minutes they were at the other side and had landed at the edge of the forest . There the guns and ammunition were allotted to each man , and his share of the provisions and of the scanty baggage . Then having paid the Indians , and having instructed them to say nothing of their movements , they turned their backs upon the river and plunged into the silent woods.All day they pushed on through the woodlands , walking in single file , Amos Green first , then the seaman , then the lady , and De Catinat bringing up the rear . The young woodsman advanced cautiously , seeing and hearing much that was lost to his companions , stopping continually and examining the signs of leaf and moss and twig . Their route lay for the most part through open glades amid a huge pine forest , with a green sward beneath their feet , made beautiful by the white euphorbia , the golden rod , and the purple aster . Sometimes , however , the great trunks closed in upon them , and they had to grope their way in a dim twilight , or push a path through the tangled brushwood of green sassafras or scarlet sumach . And then again the woods would shred suddenly away in front of them , and they would skirt marshes , overgrown with wild rice and dotted with little dark clumps of alder bushes , or make their way past silent woodland lakes , all streaked and barred with the tree shadows which threw their crimsons and clarets and bronzes upon the fringe of the deep blue sheet of water . There were streams , too , some clear and rippling where the trout flashed and the king-fisher gleamed , others dark and poisonous from the tamarack swamps , where the wanderers had to wade over their knees and carry Adele in their arms . So all day they journeyed 'mid the great forests , with never a hint or token of their fellow-man.But if man were absent , there was at least no want of life . It buzzed and chirped and chattered all round them from marsh and stream and brushwood . Sometimes it was the dun coat of a deer which glanced between the distant trunks , sometimes the badger which scuttled for its hole at their approach . Once the long in-toed track of a bear lay marked in the soft earth before them , and once Amos picked a great horn from amid the bushes which some moose had shed the month before . Little red squirrels danced and clattered above their heads , and every oak was a choir with a hundred tiny voices piping from the shadow of its foliage . As they passed the lakes the heavy gray stork flapped up in front of them , and they saw the wild duck whirring off in a long V against the blue sky , or heard the quavering cry of the loon from amid the reeds.That night they slept in the woods , Amos Green lighting a dry wood fire in a thick copse where at a dozen paces it was invisible . A few drops of rain had fallen , so with the quick skill of the practised woodsman he made two little sheds of elm and basswood bark , one to shelter the two refugees , and the other for Ephraim and himself . He had shot a wild goose , and this , with the remains of their biscuit , served them both for supper and for breakfast . Next day at noon they passed a little clearing , in the centre of which were the charred embers of a fire . Amos spent half an hour in reading all that sticks and ground could tell him . Then , as they resumed their way , he explained to his companions that the fire had been lit three weeks before , that a white man and two Indians had camped there , that they had been journeying from west to east , and that one of the Indians had been a squaw . No other traces of their fellow-mortals did they come across , until late in the afternoon Amos halted suddenly in the heart of a thick grove , and raised his hand to his ear. '' Listen ! '' he cried . `` I hear nothing , '' said Ephraim . `` Nor I , '' added De Catinat . `` Ah , but I do ! '' cried Adele gleefully . `` It is a bell -- -and at the very time of day when the bells all sound in Paris ! `` `` You are right , madame . It is what they call the Angelus bell . `` `` Ah , yes , I hear it now ! '' cried De Catinat . `` It was drowned by the chirping of the birds . But whence comes a bell in the heart of a Canadian forest ? `` `` We are near the settlements on the Richelieu . It must be the bell of the chapel at the fort . `` `` Fort St. Louis ! Ah , then , we are no great way from my friend 's seigneury . `` `` Then we may sleep there to-night , if you think that he is indeed to be trusted. '' '' Yes . He is a strange man , with ways of his own , but I would trust him with my life . `` `` Very good . We shall keep to the south of the fort and make for his house . But something is putting up the birds over yonder . Ah , I hear the sound of steps ! Crouch down here among the sumach , until we see who it is who walks so boldly through the woods . `` They stooped all four among the brushwood , peeping out between the tree trunks at a little glade towards which Amos was looking . For a long time the sound which the quick ears of the woodsman had detected was inaudible to the others , but at last they too heard the sharp snapping of twigs as some one forced his passage through the undergrowth . A moment later a man pushed his way into the open , whose appearance was so strange and so ill-suited to the spot , that even Amos gazed upon him with amazement.He was a very small man , so dark and weather-stained that he might have passed for an Indian were it not that he walked and was clad as no Indian had ever been . He wore a broad-brimmed hat , frayed at the edges , and so discoloured that it was hard to say what its original tint had been . His dress was of skins , rudely cut and dangling loosely from his body , and he wore the high boots of a dragoon , as tattered and stained as the rest of his raiment . On his back
