, then I am very much deceived . So now , you see , we begin to visualize a large book printed in double columns which are each of a considerable length , since one of the words is numbered in the document as the two hundred and ninety-third . Have we reached the limits of what reason can supply ? `` `` I fear that we have . `` `` Surely you do yourself an injustice . One more coruscation , my dear Watson -- -yet another brain-wave ! Had the volume been an unusual one , he would have sent it to me . Instead of that , he had intended , before his plans were nipped , to send me the clue in this envelope . He says so in his note . This would seem to indicate that the book is one which he thought I would have no difficulty in finding for myself . He had it -- -and he imagined that I would have it , too . In short , Watson , it is a very common book . `` `` What you say certainly sounds plausible . `` `` So we have contracted our field of search to a large book , printed in double columns and in common use . `` `` The Bible ! '' I cried triumphantly . `` Good , Watson , good ! But not , if I may say so , quite good enough ! Even if I accepted the compliment for myself I could hardly name any volume which would be less likely to lie at the elbow of one of Moriarty 's associates . Besides , the editions of Holy Writ are so numerous that he could hardly suppose that two copies would have the same pagination . This is clearly a book which is standardized . He knows for certain that his page 534 will exactly agree with my page 534 . `` `` But very few books would correspond with that. '' '' Exactly . Therein lies our salvation . Our search is narrowed down to standardized books which anyone may be supposed to possess. '' '' Bradshaw ! `` `` There are difficulties , Watson . The vocabulary of Bradshaw is nervous and terse , but limited . The selection of words would hardly lend itself to the sending of general messages . We will eliminate Bradshaw . The dictionary is , I fear , inadmissible for the same reason . What then is left ? `` `` An almanac ! `` `` Excellent , Watson ! I am very much mistaken if you have not touched the spot . An almanac ! Let us consider the claims of Whitaker 's Almanac . It is in common use . It has the requisite number of pages . It is in double column . Though reserved in its earlier vocabulary , it becomes , if I remember right , quite garrulous towards the end . '' He picked the volume from his desk . `` Here is page 534 , column two , a substantial block of print dealing , I perceive , with the trade and resources of British India . Jot down the words , Watson ! Number thirteen is 'Mahratta . ' Not , I fear , a very auspicious beginning . Number one hundred and twenty-seven is 'Government ' ; which at least makes sense , though somewhat irrelevant to ourselves and Professor Moriarty . Now let us try again . What does the Mahratta government do ? Alas ! the next word is 'pig's-bristles . ' We are undone , my good Watson ! It is finished ! `` He had spoken in jesting vein , but the twitching of his bushy eyebrows bespoke his disappointment and irritation . I sat helpless and unhappy , staring into the fire . A long silence was broken by a sudden exclamation from Holmes , who dashed at a cupboard , from which he emerged with a second yellow-covered volume in his hand . `` We pay the price , Watson , for being too up-to-date ! '' he cried . `` We are before our time , and suffer the usual penalties . Being the seventh of January , we have very properly laid in the new almanac . It is more than likely that Porlock took his message from the old one . No doubt he would have told us so had his letter of explanation been written . Now let us see what page 534 has in store for us . Number thirteen is 'There , ' which is much more promising . Number one hundred and twenty-seven is 'is ' -- -'There is ' `` -- -Holmes 's eyes were gleaming with excitement , and his thin , nervous fingers twitched as he counted the words -- - '' 'danger . ' Ha ! Ha ! Capital ! Put that down , Watson . 'There is danger -- -may -- -come -- -very soon -- -one . ' Then we have the name 'Douglas ' -- -'rich -- -country -- -now -- -at Birlstone -- -House -- -Birlstone -- -confidence -- -is -- -pressing . ' There , Watson ! What do you think of pure reason and its fruit ? If the green-grocer had such a thing as a laurel wreath , I should send Billy round for it . `` I was staring at the strange message which I had scrawled , as he deciphered it , upon a sheet of foolscap on my knee . `` What a queer , scrambling way of expressing his meaning ! '' said I . `` On the contrary , he has done quite remarkably well , '' said Holmes . `` When you search a single column for words with which to express your meaning , you can hardly expect to get everything you want . You are bound to leave something to the intelligence of your correspondent . The purport is perfectly clear . Some deviltry is intended against one Douglas , whoever he may be , residing as stated , a rich country gentleman . He is sure -- -'confidence ' was as near as he could get to 'confident ' -- -that it is pressing . There is our result -- -and a very workmanlike little bit of analysis it was ! `` Holmes had the impersonal joy of the true artist in his better work , even as he mourned darkly when it fell below the high level to which he aspired . He was still chuckling over his success when Billy swung open the door and Inspector MacDonald of Scotland Yard was ushered into the room.Those were the early days at the end of the '80 's , when Alec MacDonald was far from having attained the national fame which he has now achieved . He was a young but trusted member of the detective force , who had distinguished himself in several cases which had been intrusted to him . His tall , bony figure gave promise of exceptional physical strength , while his great cranium and deep-set , lustrous eyes spoke no less clearly of the keen intelligence which twinkled out from behind his bushy eyebrows . He was a silent , precise man with a dour nature and a hard Aberdonian accent.Twice already in his career had Holmes helped him to attain success , his own sole reward being the intellectual joy of the problem . For this reason the affection and respect of the Scotchman for his amateur colleague were profound , and he showed them by the frankness with which he consulted Holmes in every difficulty . Mediocrity knows nothing higher than itself ; but talent instantly recognizes genius , and MacDonald had talent enough for his profession to enable him to perceive that there was no humiliation in seeking the assistance of one who already stood alone in Europe , both in his gifts and in his experience . Holmes was not prone to friendship , but he was tolerant of the big Scotchman , and smiled at the sight of him . `` You are an early bird , Mr. Mac , '' said he . `` I wish you luck with your worm . I fear this means that there is some mischief afoot . `` `` If you said 'hope ' instead of 'fear , ' it would be nearer the truth , I 'm thinking , Mr. Holmes , '' the inspector answered , with a knowing grin . `` Well , maybe a wee nip would keep out the raw morning chill . No , I wo n't smoke , I thank you . I 'll have to be pushing on my way ; for the early hours of a case are the precious ones , as no man knows better than your own self . But -- -but -- - '' The inspector had stopped suddenly , and was staring with a look of absolute amazement at a paper upon the table . It was the sheet upon which I had scrawled the enigmatic message. '' Douglas ! '' he stammered . `` Birlstone ! What 's this , Mr. Holmes ? Man , it 's witchcraft ! Where in the name of all that is wonderful did you get those names ? `` `` It is a cipher that Dr. Watson and I have had occasion to solve . But why -- -what 's amiss with the names ? `` The inspector looked from one to the other of us in dazed astonishment . `` Just this , '' said he , `` that Mr. Douglas of Birlstone Manor House was horribly murdered last night ! `` It was one of those dramatic moments for which my friend existed . It would be an overstatement to say that he was shocked or even excited by the amazing announcement . Without having a tinge of cruelty in his singular composition , he was undoubtedly callous from long overstimulation . Yet , if his emotions were dulled , his intellectual perceptions were exceedingly active . There was no trace then of the horror which I had myself felt at this curt declaration ; but his face showed rather the quiet and interested composure of the chemist who sees the crystals falling into position from his oversaturated solution. '' Remarkable ! '' said he . `` Remarkable ! `` `` You do n't seem surprised . `` `` Interested , Mr. Mac , but hardly surprised . Why should I be surprised ? I receive an anonymous communication from a quarter which I know to be important , warning me that danger threatens a certain person . Within an hour I learn that this danger has actually materialized and that the person is dead . I am interested ; but , as you observe , I am not surprised . `` In a few short sentences he explained to the inspector the facts about the letter and the cipher . MacDonald sat with his chin on his hands and his great sandy eyebrows bunched into a yellow tangle . `` I was going down to Birlstone this morning , '' said he . `` I had come to ask you if you cared to come with me -- -you and your friend here . But from what you say we might perhaps be doing better work in London . `` `` I rather think not , '' said Holmes . `` Hang it all , Mr . Holmes ! '' cried the inspector . `` The papers will be full of the Birlstone mystery in a day or two ; but where 's the mystery if there is a man in London who prophesied the crime before ever it occurred ?
