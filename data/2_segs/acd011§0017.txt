'' Yes . `` `` You may find you need it here , '' said the workman. '' Ah ! is that so ? '' The young man seemed interested . `` Have you heard nothing of doings hereabouts ? `` `` Nothing out of the way . `` `` Why , I thought the country was full of it . You 'll hear quick enough . What made you come here ? `` `` I heard there was always work for a willing man . `` `` Are you a member of the union ? '' '' Sure . `` `` Then you 'll get your job , I guess . Have you any friends ? `` `` Not yet ; but I have the means of making them . `` `` How 's that , then ? `` `` I am one of the Eminent Order of Freemen . There 's no town without a lodge , and where there is a lodge I 'll find my friends . `` The remark had a singular effect upon his companion . He glanced round suspiciously at the others in the car . The miners were still whispering among themselves . The two police officers were dozing . He came across , seated himself close to the young traveller , and held out his hand . `` Put it there , '' he said.A hand-grip passed between the two . `` I see you speak the truth , '' said the workman . `` But it 's well to make certain . '' He raised his right hand to his right eyebrow . The traveller at once raised his left hand to his left eyebrow . `` Dark nights are unpleasant , '' said the workman . `` Yes , for strangers to travel , '' the other answered . `` That 's good enough . I 'm Brother Scanlan , Lodge 341 , Vermissa Valley . Glad to see you in these parts . `` `` Thank you . I 'm Brother John McMurdo , Lodge 29 , Chicago . Bodymaster J.H . Scott . But I am in luck to meet a brother so early . `` `` Well , there are plenty of us about . You wo n't find the order more flourishing anywhere in the States than right here in Vermissa Valley . But we could do with some lads like you . I ca n't understand a spry man of the union finding no work to do in Chicago . `` `` I found plenty of work to do , '' said McMurdo . `` Then why did you leave ? `` McMurdo nodded towards the policemen and smiled . `` I guess those chaps would be glad to know , '' he said.Scanlan groaned sympathetically . `` In trouble ? '' he asked in a whisper. '' Deep . `` `` A penitentiary job ? `` `` And the rest . `` `` Not a killing ! `` `` It 's early days to talk of such things , '' said McMurdo with the air of a man who had been surprised into saying more than he intended . `` I 've my own good reasons for leaving Chicago , and let that be enough for you . Who are you that you should take it on yourself to ask such things ? '' His gray eyes gleamed with sudden and dangerous anger from behind his glasses . `` All right , mate , no offense meant . The boys will think none the worse of you , whatever you may have done . Where are you bound for now ? '' '' Vermissa . `` `` That 's the third halt down the line . Where are you staying ? `` McMurdo took out an envelope and held it close to the murky oil lamp . `` Here is the address -- -Jacob Shafter , Sheridan Street . It 's a boarding house that was recommended by a man I knew in Chicago . `` `` Well , I do n't know it ; but Vermissa is out of my beat . I live at Hobson 's Patch , and that 's here where we are drawing up . But , say , there 's one bit of advice I 'll give you before we part : If you 're in trouble in Vermissa , go straight to the Union House and see Boss McGinty . He is the Bodymaster of Vermissa Lodge , and nothing can happen in these parts unless Black Jack McGinty wants it . So long , mate ! Maybe we 'll meet in lodge one of these evenings . But mind my words : If you are in trouble , go to Boss McGinty . `` Scanlan descended , and McMurdo was left once again to his thoughts . Night had now fallen , and the flames of the frequent furnaces were roaring and leaping in the darkness . Against their lurid background dark figures were bending and straining , twisting and turning , with the motion of winch or of windlass , to the rhythm of an eternal clank and roar . `` I guess hell must look something like that , '' said a voice.McMurdo turned and saw that one of the policemen had shifted in his seat and was staring out into the fiery waste . `` For that matter , '' said the other policeman , `` I allow that hell must BE something like that . If there are worse devils down yonder than some we could name , it 's more than I 'd expect . I guess you are new to this part , young man ? `` `` Well , what if I am ? '' McMurdo answered in a surly voice . `` Just this , mister , that I should advise you to be careful in choosing your friends . I do n't think I 'd begin with Mike Scanlan or his gang if I were you . `` `` What the hell is it to you who are my friends ? '' roared McMurdo in a voice which brought every head in the carriage round to witness the altercation . `` Did I ask you for your advice , or did you think me such a sucker that I could n't move without it ? You speak when you are spoken to , and by the Lord you 'd have to wait a long time if it was me ! '' He thrust out his face and grinned at the patrolmen like a snarling dog.The two policemen , heavy , good-natured men , were taken aback by the extraordinary vehemence with which their friendly advances had been rejected . `` No offense , stranger , '' said one . `` It was a warning for your own good , seeing that you are , by your own showing , new to the place . `` `` I 'm new to the place ; but I 'm not new to you and your kind ! '' cried McMurdo in cold fury . `` I guess you 're the same in all places , shoving your advice in when nobody asks for it . `` `` Maybe we 'll see more of you before very long , '' said one of the patrolmen with a grin . `` You 're a real hand-picked one , if I am a judge . `` `` I was thinking the same , '' remarked the other . `` I guess we may meet again . `` `` I 'm not afraid of you , and do n't you think it ! '' cried McMurdo . `` My name 's Jack McMurdo -- -see ? If you want me , you 'll find me at Jacob Shafter 's on Sheridan Street , Vermissa ; so I 'm not hiding from you , am I ? Day or night I dare to look the like of you in the face -- -do n't make any mistake about that ! `` There was a murmur of sympathy and admiration from the miners at the dauntless demeanour of the newcomer , while the two policemen shrugged their shoulders and renewed a conversation between themselves.A few minutes later the train ran into the ill-lit station , and there was a general clearing ; for Vermissa was by far the largest town on the line . McMurdo picked up his leather gripsack and was about to start off into the darkness , when one of the miners accosted him . `` By Gar , mate ! you know how to speak to the cops , '' he said in a voice of awe . `` It was grand to hear you . Let me carry your grip and show you the road . I 'm passing Shafter 's on the way to my own shack . `` There was a chorus of friendly `` Good-nights '' from the other miners as they passed from the platform . Before ever he had set foot in it , McMurdo the turbulent had become a character in Vermissa.The country had been a place of terror ; but the town was in its way even more depressing . Down that long valley there was at least a certain gloomy grandeur in the huge fires and the clouds of drifting smoke , while the strength and industry of man found fitting monuments in the hills which he had spilled by the side of his monstrous excavations . But the town showed a dead level of mean ugliness and squalor . The broad street was churned up by the traffic into a horrible rutted paste of muddy snow . The sidewalks were narrow and uneven . The numerous gas-lamps served only to show more clearly a long line of wooden houses , each with its veranda facing the street , unkempt and dirty.As they approached the centre of the town the scene was brightened by a row of well-lit stores , and even more by a cluster of saloons and gaming houses , in which the miners spent their hard-earned but generous wages . `` That 's the Union House , '' said the guide , pointing to one saloon which rose almost to the dignity of being a hotel . `` Jack McGinty is the boss there . `` `` What sort of a man is he ? '' McMurdo asked. '' What ! have you never heard of the boss ? `` `` How could I have heard of him when you know that I am a stranger in these parts ? `` `` Well , I thought his name was known clear across the country . It 's been in the papers often enough . `` `` What for ? `` `` Well , '' the miner lowered his voice -- - '' over the affairs . `` `` What affairs ? `` `` Good Lord , mister ! you are queer , if I must say it without offense . There 's only one set of affairs that you 'll hear of in these parts , and that 's the affairs of the Scowrers . `` `` Why , I seem to have read of the Scowrers in Chicago . A gang of murderers , are they not ? `` `` Hush , on your life ! '' cried the miner , standing still in alarm , and gazing in amazement at his companion . `` Man , you wo n't live long in these parts if you speak in the open street like that . Many a man has had the life beaten out of him for less . `` `` Well , I know nothing about them . It 's only what I have read . ``
