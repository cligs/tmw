along . `` Adele was helped over the side , and seated in the stern of a birch-bark canoe . The three men unhooked the ladder , and swung themselves down by a rope , while two Indians , who held the paddles , pushed silently off from the ship 's side , and shot swiftly up the stream . A minute later a dim loom behind them , and the glimmer of two yellow lights , was all that they could see of theSt . Christophe . `` Take a paddle , Amos , and I 'll take one , '' said Captain Savage , stripping off his monk 's gown . `` I felt safer in this on the deck of yon ship , but it do n't help in a boat . I believe we might have fastened the hatches and taken her , brass guns and all , had we been so minded . `` `` And been hanged as pirates at the yard-arm next morning , '' said Amos . `` I think we have done better to take the honey and leave the tree.I hope , madame , that all is well with you . `` `` Nay , I can hardly understand what has happened , or where we are . `` `` Nor can I , Amos . `` `` Did you not expect us to come back for you , then ? `` `` I did not know what to expect . `` `` Well , now , but surely you could not think that we would leave you without a word . `` `` I confess that I was cut to the heart by it . `` `` I feared that you were when I looked at you with the tail of my eye , and saw you staring so blackly over the bulwarks at us . But if we had been seen talking or planning they would have been upon our trail at once . As it was they had not a thought of suspicion , save only this fellow whom we have in the bottom of the boat here . `` `` And what did you do ? `` `` We left the brig last night , got ashore on the Beaupre side , arranged for this canoe , and lay dark all day . Then to-night we got alongside and I roused you easily , for I knew where you slept . The friar nearly spoiled all when you were below , but we gagged him and passed him over the side . Ephraim popped on his gown so that he might go forward to help you without danger , for we were scared at the delay. '' '' Ah ! it is glorious to be free once more . What do I not owe you , Amos ? `` `` Well , you looked after me when I was in your country , and I am going to look after you now . `` `` And where are we going ? '' '' Ah ! there you have me . It is this way or none , for we ca n't get down to the sea . We must make our way over land as best we can , and we must leave a good stretch between Quebec citadel and us before the day breaks , for from what I hear they would rather have a Huguenot prisoner than an Iroquois sagamore . By the eternal , I can not see why they should make such a fuss over how a man chooses to save his own soul , though here is old Ephraim just as fierce upon the other side , so all the folly is not one way . `` `` What are you saying about me ? '' asked the seaman , pricking up his ears at the mention of his own name . `` Only that you are a good stiff old Protestant . `` `` Yes , thank God . My motto is freedom to conscience , d 'ye see , except just for Quakers , and Papists , and -- -and I would n't stand Anne Hutchinsons and women testifying , and suchlike foolishness . `` Amos Green laughed . `` The Almighty seems to pass it over , so why should you take it to heart ? '' said he . `` Ah , you 're young and callow yet . You 'll live to know better . Why , I shall hear you saying a good word soon even for such unclean spawn as this , '' prodding the prostrate friar with the handle of his paddle . `` I daresay he 's a good man , accordin ' to his lights . `` `` And I daresay a shark is a good fish accordin ' to its lights . No , lad , you wo n't mix up light and dark for me in that sort of fashion . You may talk until you unship your jaw , d 'ye see , but you will never talk a foul wind into a fair one . Pass over the pouch and the tinder-box , and maybe our friend here will take a turn at my paddle . `` All night they toiled up the great river , straining every nerve to place themselves beyond the reach of pursuit . By keeping well into the southern bank , and so avoiding the force of the current , they sped swiftly along , for both Amos and De Catinat were practised hands with the paddle , and the two Indians worked as though they were wire and whipcord instead of flesh and blood . An utter silence reigned over all the broad stream , broken only by the lap-lap of the water against their curving bow , the whirring of the night hawk above them , and the sharp high barking of foxes away in the woods . When at last morning broke , and the black shaded imperceptibly into gray , they were far out of sight of the citadel and of all trace of man 's handiwork . Virgin woods in their wonderful many-coloured autumn dress flowed right down to the river edge on either side , and in the centre was a little island with a rim of yellow sand and an out-flame of scarlet tupelo and sumach in one bright tangle of colour in the centre . `` I 've passed here before , '' said De Catinat . `` I remember marking that great maple with the blaze on its trunk , when last I went with the governor to Montreal . That was in Frontenac 's day , when the king was first and the bishop second . `` The Redskins , who had sat like terra-cotta figures , without a trace of expression upon their set hard faces , pricked up their ears at the sound of that name . `` My brother has spoken of the great Onontio , '' said one of them , glancing round . `` We have listened to the whistling of evil birds who tell us that he will never come back to his children across the seas . `` `` He is with the great white father , '' answered De Catinat . `` I have myself seen him in his council , and he will assuredly come across the great water if his people have need of him . `` The Indian shook his shaven head . `` The rutting month is past , my brother , '' said he , speaking in broken French , `` but ere the month of the bird-laying has come there will be no white man upon this river save only behind stone walls . `` `` What , then ? We have heard little ! Have the Iroquois broken out so fiercely ? `` `` My brother , they said they would eat up the Hurons , and where are the Hurons now ? They turned their faces upon the Eries , and where are the Eries now ? They went westward against the Illinois , and who can find an Illinois village ? They raised the hatchet against the Andastes , and their name is blotted from the earth . And now they have danced a dance and sung a song which will bring little good to my white brothers . `` `` Where are they , then ? `` The Indian waved his hand along the whole southern and western horizon . `` Where are they not ? The woods are rustling with them . They are like a fire among dry grass , so swift and so terrible ! `` `` On my life , '' said De Catinat , `` if these devils are indeed unchained , they will need old Frontenac back if they are not to be swept into the river . `` `` Ay , '' said Amos , `` I saw him once , when I was brought before him with the others for trading on what he called French ground . His mouth set like a skunk trap and he looked at us as if he would have liked our scalps for his leggings . But I could see that he was a chief and a brave man . `` `` He was an enemy of the Church , and the right hand of the foul fiend in this country , '' said a voice from the bottom of the canoe.It was the friar who had succeeded in getting rid of the buckskin glove and belt with which the two Americans had gagged him . He was lying huddled up now glaring savagely at the party with his fiery dark eyes . `` His jaw-tackle has come adrift , '' said the seaman . `` Let me brace it up again . `` `` Nay , why should we take him farther ? '' asked Amos . `` He is but weight for us to carry , and I can not see that we profit by his company . Let us put him out . `` `` Ay , sink or swim , '' cried old Ephraim with enthusiasm . `` Nay , upon the bank . `` `` And have him maybe in front of us warning the black jackets . `` `` On that island , then . `` `` Very good . He can hail the first of his folk who pass . `` They shot over to the island and landed the friar , who said nothing , but cursed them with his eye . They left with him a small supply of biscuit and of flour to last him until he should be picked up . Then , having passed a bend in the river , they ran their canoe ashore in a little cove where the whortleberry and cranberry bushes grew right down to the water 's edge , and the sward was bright with the white euphorbia , the blue gentian , and the purple balm . There they laid out their small stock of provisions , and ate a hearty breakfast while discussing what their plans should be for the future.They were not badly provided for their journey . The captain of the Gloucester brig in which the Americans had started from Quebec knew Ephraim Savage well , as who did not upon the New England coast ? He had accepted his bill therefore at three months ' date , at as high a rate of interest as he could screw out of him , and he had let him have in return three excellent guns , a good supply of ammunition , and enough money to provide for all his wants . In this way he had hired the canoe
