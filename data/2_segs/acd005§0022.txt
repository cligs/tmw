cheeks and her heart beating wildly . The door opened , and she saw outlined against the gray light of the outer passage the erect and graceful figure of the king. '' Sire ! One instant , and mademoiselle will light the lamp . `` `` Do not call her . '' He entered and closed the door behind him . `` Francoise , the dusk is welcome to me , because it screens me from the reproaches which must lie in your glance , even if your tongue be too kindly to speak them . `` `` Reproaches , sire ! God forbid that I should utter them ! `` `` When I last left you , Francoise , it was with a good resolution in my mind . I tried to carry it out , and I failed -- -I failed . I remember that you warned me . Fool that I was not to follow your advice ! `` `` We are all weak and mortal , sire . Who has not fallen ? Nay , sire , it goes to my heart to see you thus . `` He was standing by the fireplace , his face buried in his hands , and she could tell by the catch of his breath that he was weeping . All the pity of her woman 's nature went out to that silent and repenting figure dimly seen in the failing light . She put out her hand with a gesture of sympathy , and it rested for an instant upon his velvet sleeve . The next he had clasped it between his own , and she made no effort to release it . `` I can not do without you , Francoise , '' he cried . `` I am the loneliest man in all this world , like one who lives on a great mountain-peak , with none to bear him company . Who have I for a friend ? Whom can I rely upon ? Some are for the Church ; some are for their families ; most are for themselves . But who of them all is single-minded ? You are my better self , Francoise ; you are my guardian angel . What the good father says is true , and the nearer I am to you the further am I from all that is evil . Tell me , Francoise , do you love me ? `` `` I have loved you for years , sire . '' Her voice was low but clear -- -the voice of a woman to whom coquetry was abhorrent . `` I had hoped it , Francoise , and yet it thrills me to hear you say it . I know that wealth and title have no attraction for you , and that your heart turns rather towards the convent than the palace . Yet I ask you to remain in the palace , and to reign there . Will you be my wife , Francoise ? `` And so the moment had in very truth come . She paused for an instant , only an instant , before taking this last great step ; but even that was too long for the patience of the king . `` Will you not , Francoise ? '' he cried , with a ring of fear in his voice . `` May God make me worthy of such an honour , sire ! '' said she . `` And here I swear that if heaven double my life , every hour shall be spent in the one endeavour to make you a happier man ! `` She had knelt down , and the king , still holding her hand , knelt down beside her . `` And I swear too , '' he cried , `` that if my days also are doubled , you will now and forever be the one and only woman for me . `` And so their double oath was taken , an oath which was to be tested in the future , for each did live almost double their years , and yet neither broke the promise made hand in hand on that evening in the shadow-girt chamber.It may have been that Mademoiselle Nanon , the faithfulconfidanteof Madame de Maintenon , had learned something of this interview , or it may be that Pere la Chaise , with the shrewdness for which his Order is famous , had come to the conclusion that publicity was the best means of holding the king to his present intention ; but whatever the source , it was known all over the court next day that the old favourite was again in disgrace , and that there was talk of a marriage between the king and the governess of his children . It was whispered at thepetit lever , confirmed at thegrand entree , and was common gossip by the time that the king had returned from chapel . Back into wardrobe and drawer went the flaring silks and the feathered hats , and out once more came the sombre coat and the matronly dress . Scudery and Calpernedi gave place to the missal and St. Thomas a Kempis , while Bourdaloue , after preaching for a week to empty benches , found his chapel packed to the last seat with weary gentlemen and taper-bearing ladies . By midday there was none in the court who had not heard the tidings , save only Madame de Montespan , who , alarmed by her lover 's absence , had remained in haughty seclusion in her room , and knew nothing of what had passed . Many there were who would have loved to carry her the tidings ; but the king 's changes had been frequent of late , and who would dare to make a mortal enemy of one who might , ere many weeks were past , have the lives and fortunes of the whole court in the hollow of her hand ? Louis , in his innate selfishness , had been so accustomed to regard every event entirely from the side of how it would affect himself , that it had never struck him that his long-suffering family , who had always yielded to him the absolute obedience which he claimed as his right , would venture to offer any opposition to his new resolution . He was surprised , therefore , when his brother demanded a private interview that afternoon , and entered his presence without the complaisant smile and humble air with which he was wont to appear before him.Monsieur was a curious travesty of his elder brother . He was shorter , but he wore enormously high boot-heels , which brought him to a fair stature . In figure he had none of that grace which marked the king , nor had he the elegant hand and foot which had been the delight of sculptors . He was fat , waddled somewhat in his walk , and wore an enormous black wig , which rolled down in rows and rows of curls over his shoulders . His face was longer and darker than the king 's , and his nose more prominent , though he shared with his brother the large brown eyes which each had inherited from Anne of Austria . He had none of the simple and yet stately taste which marked the dress of the monarch , but his clothes were all tagged over with fluttering ribbons , which rustled behind him as he walked , and clustered so thickly over his feet as to conceal them from view . Crosses , stars , jewels , and insignia were scattered broadcast over his person , and the broad blue ribbon of the Order of the Holy Ghost was slashed across his coat , and was gathered at the end into a great bow , which formed the incongruous support of a diamond-hilted sword . Such was the figure which rolled towards the king , bearing in his right hand his many-feathered beaver , and appearing in his person , as he was in his mind , an absurd burlesque of the monarch . `` Why , monsieur , you seem less gay than usual to-day , '' said the king , with a smile . `` Your dress , indeed , is bright , but your brow is clouded . I trust that all is well with Madame and with the Duc de Chartres ? `` `` Yes , sire , they are well ; but they are sad like myself , and from the same cause. '' '' Indeed ! and why ? `` `` Have I ever failed in my duty as your younger brother , sire ? `` `` Never , Philippe , never ! '' said the king , laying his hand affectionately upon the other 's shoulder . `` You have set an excellent example to my subjects . `` `` Then why set a slight upon me ? '' '' Philippe ! `` `` Yes , sire , I say it is a slight . We are of royal blood , and our wives are of royal blood also . You married the Princess of Spain ; I married the Princess of Bavaria . It was a condescension , but still I did it . My first wife was the Princess of England . How can we admit into a house which has formed such alliances as these a woman who is the widow of a hunchback singer , a mere lampooner , a man whose name is a byword through Europe ? `` The king had stared in amazement at his brother , but his anger now overcame his astonishment . `` Upon my word ! '' he cried ; `` upon my word ! I have said just now that you have been an excellent brother , but I fear that I spoke a little prematurely . And so you take upon yourself to object to the lady whom I select as my wife ! `` `` I do , sire . `` `` And by what right ? `` `` By the right of the family honour , sire , which is as much mine as yours . `` `` Man , '' cried the king furiously , `` have you not yet learned that within this kingdom I am the fountain of honour , and that whomsoever I may honour becomes by that very fact honourable ? Were I to take a cinder-wench out of the Rue Poissonniere , I could at my will raise her up until the highest in France would be proud to bow down before her . Do you not know this ? `` `` No , I do not , '' cried his brother , with all the obstinacy of a weak man who has at last been driven to bay . `` I look upon it as a slight upon me and a slight upon my wife . `` `` Your wife ! I have every respect for Charlotte Elizabeth of Bavaria , but how is she superior to one whose grandfather was the dear friend and comrade in arms of Henry the Great ? Enough ! I will not condescend to argue such a matter with you ! Begone , and do not return to my presence until you have learned not to interfere in my affairs . `` `` For all that , my wife shall not know her ! '' snarled monsieur ; and then , as his brother took a fiery step or two towards him , he turned and scuttled out of the room as fast as his awkward gait and high heels would allow him.But the king was to have no quiet that day . If Madame
