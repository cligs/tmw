not hurrying ; it did not seem to him that she was particularly agitated . Just as she reached the bottom of the stair Mr. Barker had rushed out of the study . He had stopped Mrs. Douglas and begged her to go back . `` For God 's sake , go back to your room ! '' he cried . `` Poor Jack is dead ! You can do nothing . For God 's sake , go back ! `` After some persuasion upon the stairs Mrs. Douglas had gone back . She did not scream . She made no outcry whatever . Mrs. Allen , the housekeeper , had taken her upstairs and stayed with her in the bedroom . Ames and Mr. Barker had then returned to the study , where they had found everything exactly as the police had seen it . The candle was not lit at that time ; but the lamp was burning . They had looked out of the window ; but the night was very dark and nothing could be seen or heard . They had then rushed out into the hall , where Ames had turned the windlass which lowered the drawbridge . Mr. Barker had then hurried off to get the police.Such , in its essentials , was the evidence of the butler.The account of Mrs. Allen , the housekeeper , was , so far as it went , a corroboration of that of her fellow servant . The housekeeper 's room was rather nearer to the front of the house than the pantry in which Ames had been working . She was preparing to go to bed when the loud ringing of the bell had attracted her attention . She was a little hard of hearing . Perhaps that was why she had not heard the shot ; but in any case the study was a long way off . She remembered hearing some sound which she imagined to be the slamming of a door . That was a good deal earlier -- -half an hour at least before the ringing of the bell . When Mr. Ames ran to the front she went with him . She saw Mr. Barker , very pale and excited , come out of the study . He intercepted Mrs. Douglas , who was coming down the stairs . He entreated her to go back , and she answered him , but what she said could not be heard . `` Take her up ! Stay with her ! '' he had said to Mrs. Allen.She had therefore taken her to the bedroom , and endeavoured to soothe her . She was greatly excited , trembling all over , but made no other attempt to go downstairs . She just sat in her dressing gown by her bedroom fire , with her head sunk in her hands . Mrs. Allen stayed with her most of the night . As to the other servants , they had all gone to bed , and the alarm did not reach them until just before the police arrived . They slept at the extreme back of the house , and could not possibly have heard anything.So far the housekeeper could add nothing on cross-examination save lamentations and expressions of amazement.Cecil Barker succeeded Mrs. Allen as a witness . As to the occurrences of the night before , he had very little to add to what he had already told the police . Personally , he was convinced that the murderer had escaped by the window . The bloodstain was conclusive , in his opinion , on that point . Besides , as the bridge was up , there was no other possible way of escaping . He could not explain what had become of the assassin or why he had not taken his bicycle , if it were indeed his . He could not possibly have been drowned in the moat , which was at no place more than three feet deep.In his own mind he had a very definite theory about the murder . Douglas was a reticent man , and there were some chapters in his life of which he never spoke . He had emigrated to America when he was a very young man . He had prospered well , and Barker had first met him in California , where they had become partners in a successful mining claim at a place called Benito Canyon . They had done very well ; but Douglas had suddenly sold out and started for England . He was a widower at that time . Barker had afterwards realized his money and come to live in London . Thus they had renewed their friendship.Douglas had given him the impression that some danger was hanging over his head , and he had always looked upon his sudden departure from California , and also his renting a house in so quiet a place in England , as being connected with this peril . He imagined that some secret society , some implacable organization , was on Douglas 's track , which would never rest until it killed him . Some remarks of his had given him this idea ; though he had never told him what the society was , nor how he had come to offend it . He could only suppose that the legend upon the placard had some reference to this secret society . `` How long were you with Douglas in California ? '' asked Inspector MacDonald . `` Five years altogether . `` `` He was a bachelor , you say ? `` `` A widower . `` `` Have you ever heard where his first wife came from ? `` `` No , I remember his saying that she was of German extraction , and I have seen her portrait . She was a very beautiful woman . She died of typhoid the year before I met him . `` `` You do n't associate his past with any particular part of America ? `` `` I have heard him talk of Chicago . He knew that city well and had worked there . I have heard him talk of the coal and iron districts . He had travelled a good deal in his time . `` `` Was he a politician ? Had this secret society to do with politics ? `` `` No , he cared nothing about politics . `` `` You have no reason to think it was criminal ? `` `` On the contrary , I never met a straighter man in my life . `` `` Was there anything curious about his life in California ? `` `` He liked best to stay and to work at our claim in the mountains . He would never go where other men were if he could help it . That 's why I first thought that someone was after him . Then when he left so suddenly for Europe I made sure that it was so . I believe that he had a warning of some sort . Within a week of his leaving half a dozen men were inquiring for him . `` `` What sort of men ? `` `` Well , they were a mighty hard-looking crowd . They came up to the claim and wanted to know where he was . I told them that he was gone to Europe and that I did not know where to find him . They meant him no good -- -it was easy to see that . `` `` Were these men Americans -- -Californians ? `` `` Well , I do n't know about Californians . They were Americans , all right . But they were not miners . I do n't know what they were , and was very glad to see their backs . `` `` That was six years ago ? `` `` Nearer seven . `` `` And then you were together five years in California , so that this business dates back not less than eleven years at the least ? `` `` That is so . `` `` It must be a very serious feud that would be kept up with such earnestness for as long as that . It would be no light thing that would give rise to it . `` `` I think it shadowed his whole life . It was never quite out of his mind . `` `` But if a man had a danger hanging over him , and knew what it was , do n't you think he would turn to the police for protection ? `` `` Maybe it was some danger that he could not be protected against . There 's one thing you should know . He always went about armed . His revolver was never out of his pocket . But , by bad luck , he was in his dressing gown and had left it in the bedroom last night . Once the bridge was up , I guess he thought he was safe . `` `` I should like these dates a little clearer , '' said MacDonald . `` It is quite six years since Douglas left California . You followed him next year , did you not ? `` `` That is so . `` `` And he had been married five years . You must have returned about the time of his marriage . `` `` About a month before . I was his best man . `` `` Did you know Mrs. Douglas before her marriage ? `` `` No , I did not . I had been away from England for ten years . `` `` But you have seen a good deal of her since . `` Barker looked sternly at the detective . `` I have seen a good deal of HIM since , '' he answered . `` If I have seen her , it is because you can not visit a man without knowing his wife . If you imagine there is any connection -- - '' '' I imagine nothing , Mr. Barker . I am bound to make every inquiry which can bear upon the case . But I mean no offense . `` `` Some inquiries are offensive , '' Barker answered angrily . `` It 's only the facts that we want . It is in your interest and everyone 's interest that they should be cleared up . Did Mr. Douglas entirely approve your friendship with his wife ? `` Barker grew paler , and his great , strong hands were clasped convulsively together . `` You have no right to ask such questions ! '' he cried . `` What has this to do with the matter you are investigating ? `` `` I must repeat the question . `` `` Well , I refuse to answer . `` `` You can refuse to answer ; but you must be aware that your refusal is in itself an answer , for you would not refuse if you had not something to conceal . `` Barker stood for a moment with his face set grimly and his strong black eyebrows drawn low in intense thought . Then he looked up with a smile . `` Well , I guess you gentlemen are only doing your clear duty after all , and I have no right to stand in the way of it . I 'd only ask you not to worry Mrs. Douglas over this matter ; for she has enough upon her just now . I may tell you that poor Douglas had just one fault in the world , and that was his jealousy . He was fond of me -- -no man could be fonder of a friend . And he
