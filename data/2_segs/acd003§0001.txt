nowhere else in the neighborhood . So much is observation . The rest is deduction . `` `` How , then , did you deduce the telegram ? `` `` Why , of course I knew that you had not written a letter , since I sat opposite to you all morning . I see also in your open desk there that you have a sheet of stamps and a thick bundle of post-cards . What could you go into the post-office for , then , but to send a wire ? Eliminate all other factors , and the one which remains must be the truth . `` `` In this case it certainly is so , '' I replied , after a little thought . `` The thing , however , is , as you say , of the simplest . Would you think me impertinent if I were to put your theories to a more severe test ? `` `` On the contrary , '' he answered , `` it would prevent me from taking a second dose of cocaine . I should be delighted to look into any problem which you might submit to me . `` `` I have heard you say that it is difficult for a man to have any object in daily use without leaving the impress of his individuality upon it in such a way that a trained observer might read it . Now , I have here a watch which has recently come into my possession . Would you have the kindness to let me have an opinion upon the character or habits of the late owner ? `` I handed him over the watch with some slight feeling of amusement in my heart , for the test was , as I thought , an impossible one , and I intended it as a lesson against the somewhat dogmatic tone which he occasionally assumed . He balanced the watch in his hand , gazed hard at the dial , opened the back , and examined the works , first with his naked eyes and then with a powerful convex lens . I could hardly keep from smiling at his crestfallen face when he finally snapped the case to and handed it back . `` There are hardly any data , '' he remarked . `` The watch has been recently cleaned , which robs me of my most suggestive facts . `` `` You are right , '' I answered . `` It was cleaned before being sent to me . '' In my heart I accused my companion of putting forward a most lame and impotent excuse to cover his failure . What data could he expect from an uncleaned watch ? `` Though unsatisfactory , my research has not been entirely barren , '' he observed , staring up at the ceiling with dreamy , lack-lustre eyes . `` Subject to your correction , I should judge that the watch belonged to your elder brother , who inherited it from your father . `` `` That you gather , no doubt , from the H. W. upon the back ? `` `` Quite so . The W. suggests your own name . The date of the watch is nearly fifty years back , and the initials are as old as the watch : so it was made for the last generation . Jewelry usually descends to the eldest son , and he is most likely to have the same name as the father . Your father has , if I remember right , been dead many years . It has , therefore , been in the hands of your eldest brother . `` `` Right , so far , '' said I . `` Anything else ? `` `` He was a man of untidy habits , -- -very untidy and careless . He was left with good prospects , but he threw away his chances , lived for some time in poverty with occasional short intervals of prosperity , and finally , taking to drink , he died . That is all I can gather . `` I sprang from my chair and limped impatiently about the room with considerable bitterness in my heart . `` This is unworthy of you , Holmes , '' I said . `` I could not have believed that you would have descended to this . You have made inquires into the history of my unhappy brother , and you now pretend to deduce this knowledge in some fanciful way . You can not expect me to believe that you have read all this from his old watch ! It is unkind , and , to speak plainly , has a touch of charlatanism in it . `` `` My dear doctor , '' said he , kindly , `` pray accept my apologies . Viewing the matter as an abstract problem , I had forgotten how personal and painful a thing it might be to you . I assure you , however , that I never even knew that you had a brother until you handed me the watch . `` `` Then how in the name of all that is wonderful did you get these facts ? They are absolutely correct in every particular . `` `` Ah , that is good luck . I could only say what was the balance of probability . I did not at all expect to be so accurate . `` `` But it was not mere guess-work ? `` `` No , no : I never guess . It is a shocking habit , -- -destructive to the logical faculty . What seems strange to you is only so because you do not follow my train of thought or observe the small facts upon which large inferences may depend . For example , I began by stating that your brother was careless . When you observe the lower part of that watch-case you notice that it is not only dinted in two places , but it is cut and marked all over from the habit of keeping other hard objects , such as coins or keys , in the same pocket . Surely it is no great feat to assume that a man who treats a fifty-guinea watch so cavalierly must be a careless man . Neither is it a very far-fetched inference that a man who inherits one article of such value is pretty well provided for in other respects . `` I nodded , to show that I followed his reasoning . `` It is very customary for pawnbrokers in England , when they take a watch , to scratch the number of the ticket with a pin-point upon the inside of the case . It is more handy than a label , as there is no risk of the number being lost or transposed . There are no less than four such numbers visible to my lens on the inside of this case . Inference , -- -that your brother was often at low water . Secondary inference , -- -that he had occasional bursts of prosperity , or he could not have redeemed the pledge . Finally , I ask you to look at the inner plate , which contains the key-hole . Look at the thousands of scratches all round the hole , -- -marks where the key has slipped . What sober man 's key could have scored those grooves ? But you will never see a drunkard 's watch without them . He winds it at night , and he leaves these traces of his unsteady hand . Where is the mystery in all this ? `` `` It is as clear as daylight , '' I answered . `` I regret the injustice which I did you . I should have had more faith in your marvellous faculty . May I ask whether you have any professional inquiry on foot at present ? '' '' None . Hence the cocaine . I can not live without brain-work . What else is there to live for ? Stand at the window here . Was ever such a dreary , dismal , unprofitable world ? See how the yellow fog swirls down the street and drifts across the dun-colored houses . What could be more hopelessly prosaic and material ? What is the use of having powers , doctor , when one has no field upon which to exert them ? Crime is commonplace , existence is commonplace , and no qualities save those which are commonplace have any function upon earth . `` I had opened my mouth to reply to this tirade , when with a crisp knock our landlady entered , bearing a card upon the brass salver . `` A young lady for you , sir , '' she said , addressing my companion . `` Miss Mary Morstan , '' he read . `` Hum ! I have no recollection of the name . Ask the young lady to step up , Mrs. Hudson . Do n't go , doctor . I should prefer that you remain . `` Miss Morstan entered the room with a firm step and an outward composure of manner . She was a blonde young lady , small , dainty , well gloved , and dressed in the most perfect taste . There was , however , a plainness and simplicity about her costume which bore with it a suggestion of limited means . The dress was a sombre grayish beige , untrimmed and unbraided , and she wore a small turban of the same dull hue , relieved only by a suspicion of white feather in the side . Her face had neither regularity of feature nor beauty of complexion , but her expression was sweet and amiable , and her large blue eyes were singularly spiritual and sympathetic . In an experience of women which extends over many nations and three separate continents , I have never looked upon a face which gave a clearer promise of a refined and sensitive nature . I could not but observe that as she took the seat which Sherlock Holmes placed for her , her lip trembled , her hand quivered , and she showed every sign of intense inward agitation . `` I have come to you , Mr. Holmes , '' she said , `` because you once enabled my employer , Mrs. Cecil Forrester , to unravel a little domestic complication . She was much impressed by your kindness and skill. '' '' Mrs . Cecil Forrester , '' he repeated thoughtfully . `` I believe that I was of some slight service to her . The case , however , as I remember it , was a very simple one . `` `` She did not think so . But at least you can not say the same of mine . I can hardly imagine anything more strange , more utterly inexplicable , than the situation in which I find myself . `` Holmes rubbed his hands , and his eyes glistened . He leaned forward in his chair with an expression of extraordinary concentration upon his clear-cut , hawklike features . `` State your case , '' said he , in brisk , business tones.I felt that my position was an embarrassing one . `` You will , I am sure , excuse me , '' I said , rising from my chair.To my surprise , the young lady held up her gloved hand to detain me . `` If your friend , '' she said , `` would be good enough to stop , he might be of inestimable service to me . `` I relapsed into my chair . `` Briefly , '' she continued , `` the facts are these
