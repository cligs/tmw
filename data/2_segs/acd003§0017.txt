then , could he conceal the launch and yet have her at hand when wanted ? I wondered what I should do myself if I were in his shoes . I could only think of one way of doing it . I might land the launch over to some boat-builder or repairer , with directions to make a trifling change in her . She would then be removed to his shed or yard , and so be effectually concealed , while at the same time I could have her at a few hours ' notice . `` `` That seems simple enough . `` `` It is just these very simple things which are extremely liable to be overlooked . However , I determined to act on the idea . I started at once in this harmless seaman 's rig and inquired at all the yards down the river . I drew blank at fifteen , but at the sixteenth -- -Jacobson 's -- -I learned that the Aurora had been handed over to them two days ago by a wooden-legged man , with some trivial directions as to her rudder . 'There ai n't naught amiss with her rudder , ' said the foreman . 'There she lies , with the red streaks . ' At that moment who should come down but Mordecai Smith , the missing owner ? He was rather the worse for liquor . I should not , of course , have known him , but he bellowed out his name and the name of his launch . 'I want her to-night at eight o'clock , ' said he , -- -'eight o'clock sharp , mind , for I have two gentlemen who wo n't be kept waiting . ' They had evidently paid him well , for he was very flush of money , chucking shillings about to the men . I followed him some distance , but he subsided into an ale-house : so I went back to the yard , and , happening to pick up one of my boys on the way , I stationed him as a sentry over the launch . He is to stand at water 's edge and wave his handkerchief to us when they start . We shall be lying off in the stream , and it will be a strange thing if we do not take men , treasure , and all . `` `` You have planned it all very neatly , whether they are the right men or not , '' said Jones ; `` but if the affair were in my hands I should have had a body of police in Jacobson 's Yard , and arrested them when they came down . `` `` Which would have been never . This man Small is a pretty shrewd fellow . He would send a scout on ahead , and if anything made him suspicious lie snug for another week . `` `` But you might have stuck to Mordecai Smith , and so been led to their hiding-place , '' said I . `` In that case I should have wasted my day . I think that it is a hundred to one against Smith knowing where they live . As long as he has liquor and good pay , why should he ask questions ? They send him messages what to do . No , I thought over every possible course , and this is the best . `` While this conversation had been proceeding , we had been shooting the long series of bridges which span the Thames . As we passed the City the last rays of the sun were gilding the cross upon the summit of St. Paul 's . It was twilight before we reached the Tower . `` That is Jacobson 's Yard , '' said Holmes , pointing to a bristle of masts and rigging on the Surrey side . `` Cruise gently up and down here under cover of this string of lighters . '' He took a pair of night-glasses from his pocket and gazed some time at the shore . `` I see my sentry at his post , '' he remarked , `` but no sign of a handkerchief . `` `` Suppose we go down-stream a short way and lie in wait for them , '' said Jones , eagerly . We were all eager by this time , even the policemen and stokers , who had a very vague idea of what was going forward . `` We have no right to take anything for granted , '' Holmes answered . `` It is certainly ten to one that they go down-stream , but we can not be certain . From this point we can see the entrance of the yard , and they can hardly see us . It will be a clear night and plenty of light . We must stay where we are . See how the folk swarm over yonder in the gaslight . `` `` They are coming from work in the yard . `` `` Dirty-looking rascals , but I suppose every one has some little immortal spark concealed about him . You would not think it , to look at them . There is no a priori probability about it . A strange enigma is man ! `` `` Some one calls him a soul concealed in an animal , '' I suggested . `` Winwood Reade is good upon the subject , '' said Holmes . `` He remarks that , while the individual man is an insoluble puzzle , in the aggregate he becomes a mathematical certainty . You can , for example , never foretell what any one man will do , but you can say with precision what an average number will be up to . Individuals vary , but percentages remain constant . So says the statistician . But do I see a handkerchief ? Surely there is a white flutter over yonder . `` `` Yes , it is your boy , '' I cried . `` I can see him plainly . `` `` And there is the Aurora , '' exclaimed Holmes , `` and going like the devil ! Full speed ahead , engineer . Make after that launch with the yellow light . By heaven , I shall never forgive myself if she proves to have the heels of us ! `` She had slipped unseen through the yard-entrance and passed behind two or three small craft , so that she had fairly got her speed up before we saw her . Now she was flying down the stream , near in to the shore , going at a tremendous rate . Jones looked gravely at her and shook his head . `` She is very fast , '' he said . `` I doubt if we shall catch her . `` `` We MUST catch her ! '' cried Holmes , between his teeth . `` Heap it on , stokers ! Make her do all she can ! If we burn the boat we must have them ! `` We were fairly after her now . The furnaces roared , and the powerful engines whizzed and clanked , like a great metallic heart . Her sharp , steep prow cut through the river-water and sent two rolling waves to right and to left of us . With every throb of the engines we sprang and quivered like a living thing . One great yellow lantern in our bows threw a long , flickering funnel of light in front of us . Right ahead a dark blur upon the water showed where the Aurora lay , and the swirl of white foam behind her spoke of the pace at which she was going . We flashed past barges , steamers , merchant-vessels , in and out , behind this one and round the other . Voices hailed us out of the darkness , but still the Aurora thundered on , and still we followed close upon her track . `` Pile it on , men , pile it on ! '' cried Holmes , looking down into the engine-room , while the fierce glow from below beat upon his eager , aquiline face . `` Get every pound of steam you can . `` `` I think we gain a little , '' said Jones , with his eyes on the Aurora . `` I am sure of it , '' said I . `` We shall be up with her in a very few minutes . `` At that moment , however , as our evil fate would have it , a tug with three barges in tow blundered in between us . It was only by putting our helm hard down that we avoided a collision , and before we could round them and recover our way the Aurora had gained a good two hundred yards . She was still , however , well in view , and the murky uncertain twilight was setting into a clear starlit night . Our boilers were strained to their utmost , and the frail shell vibrated and creaked with the fierce energy which was driving us along . We had shot through the Pool , past the West India Docks , down the long Deptford Reach , and up again after rounding the Isle of Dogs . The dull blur in front of us resolved itself now clearly enough into the dainty Aurora . Jones turned our search-light upon her , so that we could plainly see the figures upon her deck . One man sat by the stern , with something black between his knees over which he stooped . Beside him lay a dark mass which looked like a Newfoundland dog . The boy held the tiller , while against the red glare of the furnace I could see old Smith , stripped to the waist , and shovelling coals for dear life . They may have had some doubt at first as to whether we were really pursuing them , but now as we followed every winding and turning which they took there could no longer be any question about it . At Greenwich we were about three hundred paces behind them . At Blackwall we could not have been more than two hundred and fifty . I have coursed many creatures in many countries during my checkered career , but never did sport give me such a wild thrill as this mad , flying man-hunt down the Thames . Steadily we drew in upon them , yard by yard . In the silence of the night we could hear the panting and clanking of their machinery . The man in the stern still crouched upon the deck , and his arms were moving as though he were busy , while every now and then he would look up and measure with a glance the distance which still separated us . Nearer we came and nearer . Jones yelled to them to stop . We were not more than four boat 's lengths behind them , both boats flying at a tremendous pace . It was a clear reach of the river , with Barking Level upon one side and the melancholy Plumstead Marshes upon the other . At our hail the man in the stern sprang up from the deck and shook his two clinched fists at us , cursing the while in a high , cracked voice . He was a good-sized , powerful man , and as he stood poising himself with legs astride I could see that from the thigh downwards there was but a wooden stump upon the right side . At the sound of his strident , angry cries there was movement in
