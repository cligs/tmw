talking , and who now entered the room . The assurance and jauntiness which generally marked his demeanour and dress were , however , wanting . His face was disturbed and troubled , while his clothes were disarranged and untidy . He had evidently come with the intention of consulting with Sherlock Holmes , for on perceiving his colleague he appeared to be embarrassed and put out . He stood in the centre of the room , fumbling nervously with his hat and uncertain what to do . `` This is a most extraordinary case , '' he said at last -- - '' a most incomprehensible affair . `` `` Ah , you find it so , Mr . Lestrade ! '' cried Gregson , triumphantly . `` I thought you would come to that conclusion . Have you managed to find the Secretary , Mr. Joseph Stangerson ? `` `` The Secretary , Mr. Joseph Stangerson , '' said Lestrade gravely , `` was murdered at Halliday 's Private Hotel about six o'clock this morning . `` THE intelligence with which Lestrade greeted us was so momentous and so unexpected , that we were all three fairly dumfoundered . Gregson sprang out of his chair and upset the remainder of his whiskey and water . I stared in silence at Sherlock Holmes , whose lips were compressed and his brows drawn down over his eyes . `` Stangerson too ! '' he muttered . `` The plot thickens . `` `` It was quite thick enough before , '' grumbled Lestrade , taking a chair . `` I seem to have dropped into a sort of council of war . `` `` Are you -- -are you sure of this piece of intelligence ? '' stammered Gregson . `` I have just come from his room , '' said Lestrade . `` I was the first to discover what had occurred . `` `` We have been hearing Gregson 's view of the matter , '' Holmes observed . `` Would you mind letting us know what you have seen and done ? `` `` I have no objection , '' Lestrade answered , seating himself . `` I freely confess that I was of the opinion that Stangerson was concerned in the death of Drebber . This fresh development has shown me that I was completely mistaken . Full of the one idea , I set myself to find out what had become of the Secretary . They had been seen together at Euston Station about half-past eight on the evening of the third . At two in the morning Drebber had been found in the Brixton Road . The question which confronted me was to find out how Stangerson had been employed between 8.30 and the time of the crime , and what had become of him afterwards . I telegraphed to Liverpool , giving a description of the man , and warning them to keep a watch upon the American boats . I then set to work calling upon all the hotels and lodging-houses in the vicinity of Euston . You see , I argued that if Drebber and his companion had become separated , the natural course for the latter would be to put up somewhere in the vicinity for the night , and then to hang about the station again next morning . `` `` They would be likely to agree on some meeting-place beforehand , '' remarked Holmes . `` So it proved . I spent the whole of yesterday evening in making enquiries entirely without avail . This morning I began very early , and at eight o'clock I reached Halliday 's Private Hotel , in Little George Street . On my enquiry as to whether a Mr. Stangerson was living there , they at once answered me in the affirmative . `` 'No doubt you are the gentleman whom he was expecting , ' they said . 'He has been waiting for a gentleman for two days . ' '' 'Where is he now ? ' I asked . `` 'He is upstairs in bed . He wished to be called at nine . ' '' 'I will go up and see him at once , ' I said . `` It seemed to me that my sudden appearance might shake his nerves and lead him to say something unguarded . The Boots volunteered to show me the room : it was on the second floor , and there was a small corridor leading up to it . The Boots pointed out the door to me , and was about to go downstairs again when I saw something that made me feel sickish , in spite of my twenty years ' experience . From under the door there curled a little red ribbon of blood , which had meandered across the passage and formed a little pool along the skirting at the other side . I gave a cry , which brought the Boots back . He nearly fainted when he saw it . The door was locked on the inside , but we put our shoulders to it , and knocked it in . The window of the room was open , and beside the window , all huddled up , lay the body of a man in his nightdress . He was quite dead , and had been for some time , for his limbs were rigid and cold . When we turned him over , the Boots recognized him at once as being the same gentleman who had engaged the room under the name of Joseph Stangerson . The cause of death was a deep stab in the left side , which must have penetrated the heart . And now comes the strangest part of the affair . What do you suppose was above the murdered man ? `` I felt a creeping of the flesh , and a presentiment of coming horror , even before Sherlock Holmes answered . `` The word RACHE , written in letters of blood , '' he said . `` That was it , '' said Lestrade , in an awe-struck voice ; and we were all silent for a while.There was something so methodical and so incomprehensible about the deeds of this unknown assassin , that it imparted a fresh ghastliness to his crimes . My nerves , which were steady enough on the field of battle tingled as I thought of it . `` The man was seen , '' continued Lestrade . `` A milk boy , passing on his way to the dairy , happened to walk down the lane which leads from the mews at the back of the hotel . He noticed that a ladder , which usually lay there , was raised against one of the windows of the second floor , which was wide open . After passing , he looked back and saw a man descend the ladder . He came down so quietly and openly that the boy imagined him to be some carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel . He took no particular notice of him , beyond thinking in his own mind that it was early for him to be at work . He has an impression that the man was tall , had a reddish face , and was dressed in a long , brownish coat . He must have stayed in the room some little time after the murder , for we found blood-stained water in the basin , where he had washed his hands , and marks on the sheets where he had deliberately wiped his knife . `` I glanced at Holmes on hearing the description of the murderer , which tallied so exactly with his own . There was , however , no trace of exultation or satisfaction upon his face . `` Did you find nothing in the room which could furnish a clue to the murderer ? '' he asked. '' Nothing . Stangerson had Drebber 's purse in his pocket , but it seems that this was usual , as he did all the paying . There was eighty odd pounds in it , but nothing had been taken . Whatever the motives of these extraordinary crimes , robbery is certainly not one of them . There were no papers or memoranda in the murdered man 's pocket , except a single telegram , dated from Cleveland about a month ago , and containing the words , 'J . H. is in Europe . ' There was no name appended to this message . `` `` And there was nothing else ? '' Holmes asked . `` Nothing of any importance . The man 's novel , with which he had read himself to sleep was lying upon the bed , and his pipe was on a chair beside him . There was a glass of water on the table , and on the window-sill a small chip ointment box containing a couple of pills . `` Sherlock Holmes sprang from his chair with an exclamation of delight . `` The last link , '' he cried , exultantly . `` My case is complete . `` The two detectives stared at him in amazement . `` I have now in my hands , '' my companion said , confidently , `` all the threads which have formed such a tangle . There are , of course , details to be filled in , but I am as certain of all the main facts , from the time that Drebber parted from Stangerson at the station , up to the discovery of the body of the latter , as if I had seen them with my own eyes . I will give you a proof of my knowledge . Could you lay your hand upon those pills ? `` `` I have them , '' said Lestrade , producing a small white box ; `` I took them and the purse and the telegram , intending to have them put in a place of safety at the Police Station . It was the merest chance my taking these pills , for I am bound to say that I do not attach any importance to them . `` `` Give them here , '' said Holmes . `` Now , Doctor , '' turning to me , `` are those ordinary pills ? `` They certainly were not . They were of a pearly grey colour , small , round , and almost transparent against the light . `` From their lightness and transparency , I should imagine that they are soluble in water , '' I remarked . `` Precisely so , '' answered Holmes . `` Now would you mind going down and fetching that poor little devil of a terrier which has been bad so long , and which the landlady wanted you to put out of its pain yesterday . `` I went downstairs and carried the dog upstair in my arms . It 's laboured breathing and glazing eye showed that it was not far from its end . Indeed , its snow-white muzzle proclaimed that it had already exceeded the usual term of canine existence . I placed it upon a cushion on the rug . `` I will now cut one of these pills in two , '' said Holmes , and drawing his penknife he suited the action to the word . `` One half we return into the box for future purposes . The other half I will place in this wine glass , in which is a teaspoonful of water . You perceive that our friend , the Doctor , is right , and that it readily dissolves . `` `` This may be very interesting , '' said Lestrade
