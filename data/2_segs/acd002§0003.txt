attention to a case which certainly presents some features of interest . I had observed some newspaper comment at the time , but I was exceedingly preoccupied by that little affair of the Vatican cameos , and in my anxiety to oblige the Pope I lost touch with several interesting English cases . This article , you say , contains all the public facts ? `` `` It does . `` `` Then let me have the private ones . '' He leaned back , put his finger-tips together , and assumed his most impassive and judicial expression . `` In doing so , '' said Dr. Mortimer , who had begun to show signs of some strong emotion , `` I am telling that which I have not confided to anyone . My motive for withholding it from the coroner 's inquiry is that a man of science shrinks from placing himself in the public position of seeming to indorse a popular superstition . I had the further motive that Baskerville Hall , as the paper says , would certainly remain untenanted if anything were done to increase its already rather grim reputation . For both these reasons I thought that I was justified in telling rather less than I knew , since no practical good could result from it , but with you there is no reason why I should not be perfectly frank . `` The moor is very sparsely inhabited , and those who live near each other are thrown very much together . For this reason I saw a good deal of Sir Charles Baskerville . With the exception of Mr. Frankland , of Lafter Hall , and Mr. Stapleton , the naturalist , there are no other men of education within many miles . Sir Charles was a retiring man , but the chance of his illness brought us together , and a community of interests in science kept us so . He had brought back much scientific information from South Africa , and many a charming evening we have spent together discussing the comparative anatomy of the Bushman and the Hottentot . `` Within the last few months it became increasingly plain to me that Sir Charles 's nervous system was strained to the breaking point . He had taken this legend which I have read you exceedingly to heart -- -so much so that , although he would walk in his own grounds , nothing would induce him to go out upon the moor at night . Incredible as it may appear to you , Mr. Holmes , he was honestly convinced that a dreadful fate overhung his family , and certainly the records which he was able to give of his ancestors were not encouraging . The idea of some ghastly presence constantly haunted him , and on more than one occasion he has asked me whether I had on my medical journeys at night ever seen any strange creature or heard the baying of a hound . The latter question he put to me several times , and always with a voice which vibrated with excitement . `` I can well remember driving up to his house in the evening some three weeks before the fatal event . He chanced to be at his hall door . I had descended from my gig and was standing in front of him , when I saw his eyes fix themselves over my shoulder and stare past me with an expression of the most dreadful horror . I whisked round and had just time to catch a glimpse of something which I took to be a large black calf passing at the head of the drive . So excited and alarmed was he that I was compelled to go down to the spot where the animal had been and look around for it . It was gone , however , and the incident appeared to make the worst impression upon his mind . I stayed with him all the evening , and it was on that occasion , to explain the emotion which he had shown , that he confided to my keeping that narrative which I read to you when first I came . I mention this small episode because it assumes some importance in view of the tragedy which followed , but I was convinced at the time that the matter was entirely trivial and that his excitement had no justification . `` It was at my advice that Sir Charles was about to go to London . His heart was , I knew , affected , and the constant anxiety in which he lived , however chimerical the cause of it might be , was evidently having a serious effect upon his health . I thought that a few months among the distractions of town would send him back a new man . Mr. Stapleton , a mutual friend who was much concerned at his state of health , was of the same opinion . At the last instant came this terrible catastrophe . `` On the night of Sir Charles 's death Barrymore the butler , who made the discovery , sent Perkins the groom on horseback to me , and as I was sitting up late I was able to reach Baskerville Hall within an hour of the event . I checked and corroborated all the facts which were mentioned at the inquest . I followed the footsteps down the yew alley , I saw the spot at the moor-gate where he seemed to have waited , I remarked the change in the shape of the prints after that point , I noted that there were no other footsteps save those of Barrymore on the soft gravel , and finally I carefully examined the body , which had not been touched until my arrival . Sir Charles lay on his face , his arms out , his fingers dug into the ground , and his features convulsed with some strong emotion to such an extent that I could hardly have sworn to his identity . There was certainly no physical injury of any kind . But one false statement was made by Barrymore at the inquest . He said that there were no traces upon the ground round the body . He did not observe any . But I did -- -some little distance off , but fresh and clear. '' '' Footprints ? '' '' Footprints . `` `` A man 's or a woman 's ? '' Dr . Mortimer looked strangely at us for an instant , and his voice sank almost to a whisper as he answered. '' Mr . Holmes , they were the footprints of a gigantic hound ! `` I confess at these words a shudder passed through me . There was a thrill in the doctor 's voice which showed that he was himself deeply moved by that which he told us . Holmes leaned forward in his excitement and his eyes had the hard , dry glitter which shot from them when he was keenly interested . `` You saw this ? `` `` As clearly as I see you . `` `` And you said nothing ? `` `` What was the use ? `` `` How was it that no one else saw it ? `` `` The marks were some twenty yards from the body and no one gave them a thought . I do n't suppose I should have done so had I not known this legend . `` `` There are many sheep-dogs on the moor ? `` `` No doubt , but this was no sheep-dog . `` `` You say it was large ? '' '' Enormous . `` `` But it had not approached the body ? '' '' No . `` `` What sort of night was it ? ' '' Damp and raw . `` `` But not actually raining ? '' '' No . `` `` What is the alley like ? `` `` There are two lines of old yew hedge , twelve feet high and impenetrable . The walk in the centre is about eight feet across . `` `` Is there anything between the hedges and the walk ? `` `` Yes , there is a strip of grass about six feet broad on either side . `` `` I understand that the yew hedge is penetrated at one point by a gate ? `` `` Yes , the wicket-gate which leads on to the moor . `` `` Is there any other opening ? '' '' None . `` `` So that to reach the yew alley one either has to come down it from the house or else to enter it by the moor-gate ? `` `` There is an exit through a summer-house at the far end . `` `` Had Sir Charles reached this ? `` `` No ; he lay about fifty yards from it . `` `` Now , tell me , Dr. Mortimer -- -and this is important -- -the marks which you saw were on the path and not on the grass ? `` `` No marks could show on the grass . `` `` Were they on the same side of the path as the moor-gate ? `` `` Yes ; they were on the edge of the path on the same side as the moor-gate . `` `` You interest me exceedingly . Another point . Was the wicket-gate closed ? `` `` Closed and padlocked . `` `` How high was it ? `` `` About four feet high . `` `` Then anyone could have got over it ? '' '' Yes . `` `` And what marks did you see by the wicket-gate ? `` `` None in particular . `` `` Good heaven ! Did no one examine ? `` `` Yes , I examined , myself . `` `` And found nothing ? `` `` It was all very confused . Sir Charles had evidently stood there for five or ten minutes . `` `` How do you know that ? `` `` Because the ash had twice dropped from his cigar. '' '' Excellent ! This is a colleague , Watson , after our own heart . But the marks ? `` `` He had left his own marks all over that small patch of gravel . I could discern no others . `` Sherlock Holmes struck his hand against his knee with an impatient gesture . `` If I had only been there ! '' he cried . `` It is evidently a case of extraordinary interest , and one which presented immense opportunities to the scientific expert . That gravel page upon which I might have read so much has been long ere this smudged by the rain and defaced by the clogs of curious peasants . Oh , Dr. Mortimer , Dr. Mortimer , to think that you should not have called me in ! You have indeed much to answer for . `` `` I could not call you in , Mr. Holmes , without disclosing these facts to the world , and I have already given my reasons for not wishing to do so . Besides , besides -- - '' '' Why do you hesitate ? `` `` There is a realm in which the most acute and most experienced of detectives is helpless . `` `` You mean that the thing is supernatural ? `` `` I did not positively say so . `` `` No , but you evidently think it . `` `` Since the tragedy , Mr. Holmes , there have come to my ears several incidents which are hard to reconcile with the settled order of Nature . `` `` For example ? `` `` I find that
