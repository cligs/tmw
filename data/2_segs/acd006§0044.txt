a lady is like dew to a plant . I feel stringthened , madam , vitalized , invigorated . '' The major puffed out his chest and looked apoplectically tender over his high white collar . `` The chief object of me visit , '' the old soldier said after a pause , `` was to learn whether I could be of any assistance to you in any way . Afther your sad bereavement , of which I have heard , it may be that even a comparative stranger may be of service in business matters . `` `` I 'm sure it 's very kind of you , major , '' the widow answered . `` Since poor Jack died everything has been in disorder . If it would n't trouble you , I should very much like your advice on some future occasion . I 'll ask your opinion when I have cleared up things a little myself . As to these lawyers , they think of their own interests , not of yours . `` `` Quite so , '' said the major sympathetically . `` There 's the fifteen hundred of poor Jack 's insurance . That 's not laid out yet . `` `` Fifteen hundred ! '' said the major . `` That 's seventy-five pounds a year at five per cint . `` `` I can get better interest than that , '' said the widow gaily . `` I 've got two thousand laid out at seven per cent. -- -have n't I , Clara ? `` `` Safe , too , '' said the girl . `` The deuce you have ! '' thought the major . `` So , when we are making arrangements , I 'll ask your assistance and advice , Major Tanglebobs . I know that we poor women are very bad at business . `` `` I shall look forward to the day , '' said the major gallantly , rising and taking up his hat . He was very well satisfied with his little ruse and his success in breaking the ice . `` Be George ! '' he remarked to Von Baumser that evening , `` she 's got money as well as her looks . It 's a lucky man that gits her . `` `` I vill bet dat you ask her for to marry you , '' Von Baumser said with a smile . `` I 'll bet that she refuses me if I do , '' answered the major despondently , in spite of which he retired that night feeling considerably more elated than on the preceding evening.Fortune had been smiling upon the Bohemians of late . Ever since the major 's successful visit to Fenchurch Street he had been able to live in a state of luxury to which he had long been unaccustomed . His uncle , the earl , too , had condescended to think of his humble relative , and had made a small provision for him , which , with his other resources , removed all anxiety as to the future . Von Baumser had his fair share in this sudden accession of prosperity . The German had resumed his situation as commercial clerk and foreign correspondent to Eckermann & Co. , so that his circumstances had also improved . The pair had even had some conversation as to the expediency of migrating into larger and more expensive lodgings , but the major 's increasing intimacy with his fair neighbour opposite stood in the way of a change . In any case , they were loth to leave their fourth floor , and to have the trouble of moving their effects.These same effects were the pride of Major Clutterbuck 's heart . Small as their sanctum was , it was a very museum of curious objects brought from every part of the world , most of them of little intrinsic value , but all possessing a charm of association to their owner . They were his trophies of travel , battle , and the chase . From the bison rug and tiger skin upon the floor to the great Sumatran bat which hung head downwards , as in the days of its earthly existence , from the ceiling , there was not an object but had its own special history . In one corner was an Afghan matchlock , and a bundle of spears from the southern seas ; in another a carved Indian paddle , a Kaffir assegai , and an American blowpipe , with its little sheaf of poisoned arrows . Here was a hookah , richly mounted , and with all due accessories , just as it was presented to the major twenty years before by a Mahommedan chieftain , and there was a high Mexican saddle on which he had ridden through the land of the Aztecs . There was not a square foot of the walls which was not adorned by knives , javelins , Malay kreeses , Chinese opium pipes , and such other trifles as old travellers gather round them . By the side of the fire rested the campaigner 's straight regulation sword in its dim sheath -- -all the dimmer because the companions occasionally used it as a poker when that instrument happened to be missing . `` It 's not the value of thim , '' the major remarked , glancing round the apartment , `` but , bedad , there 's not one of the lot that has not got a story tacked on to it . Look at that bear 's head now , that 's grinning at ye from over the door . That 's a Thibet bear , not much bigger than a Newfoundland dog , but as fierce as a grizzly . That 's the very one that clawed Charley Travers , of the 49th . Ged , he 'd have been done for if I had n't got me Westley Richards to bear on him . 'Duck man I duck ! ' I cried , for they were so mixed that I could n't tell one from the other . He put his head down , and I caught the brute right between the eyes . Ye can see the track of the bullet on the bone . `` The major paused , and the pair smoked meditatively , for Baumser had returned from the City , and the twilight was falling and everything conduced to tobacco and reverie . `` See that necklace of cowrie shells hanging beside it , '' continued the veteran , waving his cigarette in that direction ; `` that came from the neck of a Hottentot woman -- -a black Vanus , be Jove ! We were trekking up country before the second Kaffir war . Made an appintment -- -could not go -- -orderly duty -- -so sent a trusty man to tell her . He was found next day with twenty assegais in his body . She was a decoy duck , bedad , and the whole thing a plant . `` `` Mein Gott ! '' Von Baumser ejaculated . `` What a life you have led ! I have lived with you now many months and heard you tell many tales , but ever there are fresh ones . `` `` Yes , a strange life , '' answered the major , stretching out his gaitered legs and gazing up at the ceiling . I niver thought to be stranded in me ould age . If I had n't commuted I 'd have had a fair pinsion , but I drew me money in a lump sum , and went to Monte Carlo to break the bank . Instead o ' that the bank broke me , and yet I believe me system was correct enough , and I must have won if I had had more capital . `` `` There is many says dat , '' grunted Von Baumser doubtfully . `` I believe it for all that , '' the major continued . `` Why , man , I was always the luckiest chap at cards . I depinded on me skill principally , but still I had luck as well . I remimber once being becalmed for a fortnight in the Bay of Biscay in a small transport . Skipper and I tried to kill time by playing nap , and we had the stakes low enough at first , but they soon grew higher , for he kept trying to cover his losses . Before the ind of the two weeks I cleared out of him nearly all he had in the world . 'Look here , Clutterbuck , ' he said at last , looking mighty white about the gills , 'this ship that we are in is more than half mine . I am chief owner . I 'll stake me share of the ship on the next game against all that I have lost . ' 'Done ! ' said I , and shuffled , cut , and dealt . He went four on three highest trumps , and an ace , and I held four small trumps . 'It 's a bad job for my creditors , ' he said , as he threw his hand down . Ged ! I started on that vyage a poor captain , and I came into port very fairly well off , and sailing in me own ship , too ! What d 'ye think of that ? '' '' Wunderbar ! '' ejaculated the German . `` And the captain ? `` `` Brandy , and delirium tremens , '' the major said , between the puffs of his cigarette . `` Jumped overboard off Finisterre , on the homeward vyage . Shocking thing , gamblin ' -- -when you lose . `` `` Ach Gott ! And those two knives upon the wall , the straight one and the one with the crook ; is there a history about them ? `` `` An incident , '' the major answered languidly . `` Curious , but true . Saw it meself . In the Afghan war I was convoying supplies through the passes , when we were set upon by Afreedees , hillmen , and robbers . I had fifty men of the 27th Native Infantry under me , with a sergeant . Among the Afreedees was a thumping big chief , who stood among the rocks with that very knife in his hand , the long one , shouting insults at our fellows . Our sergeant was a smart little nigger , and this cheek set his blood up . Be jabers ! he chucked his gun down , pulled out that curved dagger -- -a Ghoorkha knife it is -- -and made for the big hillman . Both sides stopped firing to see the two chaps fight . As our fellow came scrambling up over the rocks , the chief ran at him and thrust with all his stringth . Be jabers ! I thought I saw the pint of the blade come out through the sergeant 's back . He managed to twist round though , so as to dodge it . At the same time he hit up from below , and the hillman sprang into the air , looking for all the world like one o ' those open sheep you see outside a butcher 's shop . He was ripped up from stomach to throat . The sight knocked all the fight out of the other spalpeens , and they took to their heels as hard as they could run . I took the dead man 's knife away , and the sergeant sold me his for a few rupees , so there they are
