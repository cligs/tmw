even now in the jaws of death , he leaned upon his old schoolfellow and looked to him for assistance . He put a wasted hand above the counterpane and laid it upon Girdlestone 's . `` I wish to speak to you , John , '' he said . `` I am very weak . Can you hear what I say ? `` `` Yes , I hear you . `` `` Give me a spoonful from that bottle . It clears my mind for a time.I have been making my will , John . `` `` Yes , '' said the merchant , replacing the medicine bottle . `` The lawyer made it this morning . Stoop your head and you will hear me better . I have less than fifty thousand . I should have done better had I retired years ago . `` `` I told you so , '' the other broke in gruffly . `` You did -- -you did . But I acted for the best . Forty thousand I leave to my dear daughter Kate . `` A look of interest came over Girdlestone 's face . `` And the balance ? '' he asked . `` I leave that to be equally divided among the various London institutions for educating the poor . We were both poor boys ourselves , John , and we know the value of such schools . `` Girdlestone looked perhaps a trifle disappointed . The sick man went on very slowly and painfully -- - '' My daughter will have forty thousand pounds . But it is so tied up that she can neither touch it herself nor enable any one else to do so until she is of age . She has no friends , John , and no relations , save only my cousin , Dr. George Dimsdale . Never was a girl left more lonely and unprotected . Take her , I beg of you , and bring her up under your own eye . Treat her as though she were your child . Guard her above all from those who would wreck her young life in order to share her fortune . Do this , old friend , and make me happy on my deathbed . `` The merchant made no answer . His heavy eyebrows were drawn down , and his forehead all puckered with thought . `` You are the one man , '' continued the sufferer , `` whom I know to be just and upright . Give me the water , for my mouth is dry . Should , which God forbid , my dear girl perish before she marries , then -- - '' His breath failed him for a moment , and he paused to recover it . `` Well , what then ? `` `` Then , old friend , her fortune reverts to you , for there is none who will use it so well . Those are the terms of the will . But you will guard her and care for her , as I would myself . She is a tender plant , John , too weak to grow alone . Promise me that you will do right by her -- -promise it ? `` `` I do promise it , '' John Girdlestone answered in a deep voice . He was standing up now , and leaning over to catch the words of the dying man.Harston was sinking rapidly . With a feeble motion he pointed to a brown-backed volume upon the table . `` Take up the book , '' he said.The merchant picked it up . `` Now , repeat after me , I swear and solemnly pledge myself -- - '' '' I swear and solemnly pledge myself -- - '' To treasure and guard as if she were my own -- - '' came the tremulous voice from the bed . `` To treasure and guard as if she were my own -- - '' in the deep bass of the merchant . `` Kate Harston , the daughter of my deceased friend -- - '' '' Kate Harston , the daughter of my deceased friend -- - '' '' And as I treat her , so may my own flesh and blood treat me ! `` `` And as I treat her , so may my own flesh and blood treat me ! `` The sick man 's head fell back exhausted upon his pillow . `` Thank God ! '' he muttered , `` now I can die in peace . `` `` Turn your mind away from the vanities and dross of this world , '' John Girdlestone said sternly , `` and fix it upon that which is eternal , and can never die . `` `` Are you going ? '' the invalid asked sadly , for he had taken up his hat and stick . `` Yes , I must go ; I have an appointment in the City at six , which I must not miss . `` `` And I have an appointment which I must not miss , '' the dying man said with a feeble smile . `` I shall send up the nurse as I go down , '' Girdlestone said. '' Good-bye ! '' '' Good-bye ! God bless you , John ! `` The firm , strong hand of the hale man enclosed for a moment the feeble , burning one of the sufferer . Then John Girdlestone plodded heavily down the stair , and these friends of forty years ' standing had said their last adieu.The African merchant kept his appointment in the City , but long before he reached it John Harston had gone also to keep that last terrible appointment of which the messenger is death.It was a dull October morning in Fenchurch Street , some weeks after the events with which our story opened . The murky City air looked murkier still through the glazed office windows . Girdlestone , grim and grey , as though he were the very embodiment of the weather , stooped over his mahogany table . He had a long list in front of him , on which he was checking off , as a prelude to the day 's work , the position in the market of the various speculations in which the capital of the firm was embarked . His son Ezra lounged in an easy chair opposite him , looking dishevelled and dark under the eyes , for he had been up half the night , and the Nemesis of reaction was upon him. '' Faugh ! '' his father ejaculated , glancing round at him with disgust . `` You have been drinking already this morning . `` `` I took a brandy and seltzer on the way to the office , '' he answered carelessly . `` I needed one to steady me . `` `` A young fellow of your age should not want steadying . You have a strong constitution , but you must not play tricks with it . You must have been very late last night . It was nearly one before I went to bed . `` `` I was playing cards with Major Clutterbuck and one or two others.We kept it up rather late . `` `` With Major Clutterbuck ? '' '' Yes . `` `` I do n't care about your consorting so much with that man . He drinks and gambles , and does you no good . What good has he ever done himself ? Take care that he does not fleece you . '' The merchant felt instinctively , as he glanced at the shrewd , dark face of his son , that the warning was a superfluous one . `` No fear , father , '' Ezra answered sulkily ; `` I am old enough to choose my own friends . `` `` Why such a friend as that ? `` `` I like to know men of that class . You are a successful man , father , but you -- -well , you ca n't be much help to me socially . You need some one to show you the ropes , and the major is my man . When I can stand alone , I 'll soon let him know it . `` `` Well , go your own way , '' said Girdlestone shortly . Hard to all the world , he was soft only in this one direction . From childhood every discussion between father and son had ended with the same words . `` It is business time , '' he resumed . `` Let us confine ourselves to business . I see that Illinois were at 112 yesterday . `` `` They are at 113 this morning. '' '' What ! have you been on 'Change already ? `` `` Yes , I dropped in there on my way to the office . I would hold on to those . They will go up for some days yet . `` The senior partner made a pencil note on the margin of the list . `` We 'll hold on to the cotton we have , '' he said . `` No , sell out at once , '' Ezra answered with decision , `` I saw young Featherstone , of Liverpool , last night , or rather this morning . It was hard to make head or tail of what the fool said , but he let fall enough to show that there was likely to be a drop . `` Girdlestone made another mark upon the paper . He never questioned his son 's decisions now , for long experience had shown him that they were never formed without solid grounds . `` Take this list , Ezra , '' he said , handing him the paper , `` and run your eye over it . If you see anything that wants changing , mark it . `` `` I 'll do it in the counting-house , '' his son answered . `` I can keep my eye on those lazy scamps of clerks . Gilray has no idea of keeping them in order . `` As he went out he cannoned against an elderly gentleman in a white waistcoat , who was being shown in , and who ricochetted off him into the office , where he shook hands heartily with the elder Girdlestone . It was evident from the laboured cordiality of the latter 's greeting that the new-comer was a man of some importance . He was , indeed , none other than the well-known philanthropist , Mr. Jefferson Edwards , M.P . for Middlehurst , whose name upon a bill was hardly second to that of Rothschild . `` How do , Girdlestone , how do ? '' he exclaimed , mopping his face with his handkerchief . He was a fussy little man , with a brusque , nervous manner . `` Hard at it as usual , eh ? Always pegging away . Wonderful man . Ha , ha ! Wonderful ! `` `` You look warm , '' the merchant answered , rubbing his hands . `` Let me offer you some claret . I have some in the cupboard . `` `` No , thank you , '' the visitor answered , staring across at the head of the firm as though he were some botanical curiosity . `` Extraordinary fellow . 'Iron ' Girdlestone , they call you in the City . A good name , too -- - ha ! ha ! -- -an excellent name . Iron-grey , you know , and hard to look at , but soft here , my dear sir , soft here . ''
