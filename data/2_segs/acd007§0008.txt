'' I answered , feeling rather disgusted at being made responsible for the presence of the disreputable-looking vagabond beside me . `` I found him on the road here , and he desired to be directed to you , so I showed him the way . I know nothing of him myself . `` `` What do you want with me , then ? '' the general asked sternly , turning to my companion . `` If you please , sir , '' said the ex-corporal , speaking in a whining voice , and touching his moleskin cap with a humility which contrasted strangely with the previous rough independence of his bearing , `` I 'm an old gunner in the Queen 's service , sir , and knowing your name by hearing it in India I thought that maybe you would take me as your groom or gardener , or give me any other place as happened to be vacant . `` `` I am sorry that I can not do anything for you , my man , '' the old soldier answered impressively . `` Then you 'll give me a little just to help me on my way , sir , '' said the cringing mendicant . `` You wo n't see an old comrade go to the bad for the sake of a few rupees ? I was with Sale 's brigade in the Passes , sir , and I was at the second taking of Cabul . `` General Heatherstone looked keenly at the supplicant , but was silent to his appeal . `` I was in Ghuznee with you when the walls were all shook down by an earthquake , and when we found forty thousand Afghans within gunshot of us . You ask me about it , and you 'll see whether I 'm lying or not . We went through all this when we were young , and now that we are old you are to live in a fine bungalow , and I am to starve by the roadside . It do n't seem to me to be fair . `` `` You are an impertinent scoundrel , '' said the general . `` If you had been a good soldier you would never need to ask for help . I shall not give you a farthing . `` `` One word more , sir , '' cried the tramp , for the other was turning away , `` I 've been in the Tarada Pass . `` The old soldier sprang round as if the words had been a pistol-shot . `` What -- -what d 'ye mean ? '' he stammered . `` I 've been in the Tarada Pass , sir , and I knew a man there called Ghoolab Shah . `` These last were hissed out in an undertone , and a malicious grin overspread the face of the speaker.Their effect upon the general was extraordinary . He fairly staggered back from the gateway , and his yellow countenance blanched to a livid , mottled grey . For a moment he was too overcome to speak . At last he gasped out : '' Ghoolab Shah ? Who are you who know Ghoolab Shah ? `` `` Take another look , '' said the tramp , `` your sight is not as keen as it was forty years ago . `` The general took a long , earnest look at the unkempt wanderer in front of him , and as he gazed I saw the light of recognition spring up in his eyes . `` God bless my soul ! '' he cried . `` Why , it 's Corporal Rufus Smith . `` `` You 've come on it at last , '' said the other , chuckling to himself . `` I was wondering how long it would be before you knew me . And , first of all , just unlock this gate , will you ? It 's hard to talk through a grating . It 's too much like ten minutes with a visitor in the cells . `` The general , whose face still bore evidences of his agitation , undid the bolts with nervous , trembling fingers . The recognition of Corporal Rufus Smith had , I fancied , been a relief to him , and yet he plainly showed by his manner that he regarded his presence as by no means an unmixed blessing . `` Why , Corporal , '' he said , as the gate swung open , `` I have often wondered whether you were dead or alive , but I never expected to see you again . How have you been all these long years ? `` `` How have I been ? '' the corporal answered gruffly . `` Why , I have been drunk for the most part . When I draw my money I lay it out in liquor , and as long as that lasts I get some peace in life . When I 'm cleaned out I go upon tramp , partly in the hope of picking up the price of a dram , and partly in order to look for you . `` `` You 'll excuse us talking about these private matters , West , '' the general said , looking round at me , for I was beginning to move away . `` Do n't leave us . You know something of this matter already , and may find yourself entirely in the swim with us some of these days . `` Corporal Rufus Smith looked round at me in blank astonishment . `` In the swim with us ? '' he said . `` However did he get there ? `` `` Voluntarily , voluntarily , '' the general explained , hurriedly sinking his voice . `` He is a neighbour of mine , and he has volunteered his help in case I should ever need it . `` This explanation seemed , if anything , to increase the big stranger 's surprise . `` Well , if that do n't lick cock-fighting ! '' he exclaimed , contemplating me with admiration . `` I never heard tell of such a thing . `` `` And now you have found me , Corporal Smith , '' said the tenant of Cloomber , `` what is it that you want of me ? `` `` Why , everything . I want a roof to cover me , and clothes to wear , and food to eat , and , above all , brandy to drink . `` `` Well , I 'll take you in and do what I can for you , '' said the general slowly . `` But look here , Smith , we must have discipline . I 'm the general and you are the corporal ; I am the master and you are the man . Now , do n't let me have to remind you of that again . `` The tramp drew himself up to his full height and raised his right hand with the palm forward in a military salute . `` I can take you on as gardener and get rid of the fellow I have got . As to brandy , you shall have an allowance and no more . We are not deep drinkers at the Hall . `` `` Do n't you take opium , or brandy , or nothing yourself , sir ? '' asked Corporal Rufus Smith . `` Nothing , '' the general said firmly . `` Well , all I can say is , that you 've got more nerve and pluck than I shall ever have . I do n't wonder now at your winning that Cross in the Mutiny . If I was to go on listening night after night to them things without ever taking a drop of something to cheer my heart -- -why , it would drive me silly . `` General Heatherstone put his hand up , as though afraid that his companion might say too much . `` I must thank you , Mr. West , '' he said , `` for having shown this man my door . I would not willingly allow an old comrade , however humble , to go to the bad , and if I did not acknowledge his claim more readily it was simply because I had my doubts as to whether he was really what he represented himself to be . Just walk up to the Hall , Corporal , and I shall follow you in a minute . `` `` Poor fellow ! '' he continued , as he watched the newcomer hobbling up the avenue in the ungainly manner which I have described . `` He got a gun over his foot , and it crushed the bones , but the obstinate fool would not let the doctors take it off . I remember him now as a smart young soldier in Afghanistan . He and I were associated in some queer adventures , which I may tell you of some day , and I naturally feel sympathy towards him , and would befriend him . Did he tell you anything about me before I came ? `` `` Not a word , '' I replied . `` Oh , '' said the general carelessly , but with an evident expression of relief , `` I thought perhaps he might have said something of old times . Well , I must go and look after him , or the servants will be frightened , for he is n't a beauty to look at . Good-bye ! `` With a wave of the hand the old man turned away from me and hurried up the drive after this unexpected addition to his household , while I strolled on round the high , black paling , peering through every chink between the planks , but without seeing a trace either of Mordaunt or of his sister.I have now brought this statement down to the coming of Corporal Rufus Smith , which will prove to be the beginning of the end.I have set down soberly and in order the events which brought us to Wigtownshire , the arrival of the Heatherstones at Cloomber , the many strange incidents which excited first our curiosity and finally our intense interest in that family , and I have briefly touched upon the circumstances which brought my sister and myself into a closer and more personal relationship with them . I think that there can not be a better moment than this to hand the narrative over to those who had means of knowing something of what was going on inside Cloomber during the months that I was observing it from without.Israel Stakes , the coachman , proved to be unable to read or write , but Mr. Mathew Clark , the Presbyterian Minister of Stoneykirk , has copied down his deposition , duly attested by the cross set opposite to his name . The good clergyman has , I fancy , put some slight polish upon the narrator 's story , which I rather regret , as it might have been more interesting , if less intelligible , when reported verbatim . It still preserves , however , considerable traces of Israel 's individuality , and may be regarded as an exact record of what he saw and did while in General Heatherstone 's service . ( Copied and authenticated by the Reverend Mathew Clark , Presbyterian Minister of Stoneykirk , in Wigtownshire ) Maister Fothergill West and the meenister say that I maun tell all I can aboot General Heatherstone and his hoose , but that I maunna say muckle aboot mysel ' because the readers wouldna care to
