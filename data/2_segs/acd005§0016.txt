You did not love this Scarron , then ? '' he persisted . `` He was old , I have heard , and as lame as some of his verses . `` `` Do not speak lightly of him , sire . I was grateful to him ; I honoured him ; I liked him . `` `` But you did not love him . `` `` Why should you seek to read the secrets of a woman 's heart ? `` `` You did not love him , Francoise ? `` `` At least I did my duty towards him . `` `` Has that nun 's heart never yet been touched by love then ? `` `` Sire , do not question me . `` `` Has it never -- - '' '' Spare me , sire , I beg of you ! `` `` But I must ask , for my own peace hangs upon your answer . `` `` Your words pain me to the soul . `` `` Have you never , Francoise , felt in your heart some little flicker of the love which glows in mine ? '' He rose with his hands outstretched , a pleading monarch , but she , with half-turned bead , still shrank away from him . `` Be assured of one thing , sire , '' said she , `` that even if I loved you as no woman ever loved a man yet , I should rather spring from that window on to the stone terraces beneath than ever by word or sign confess as much to you . `` `` And why , Francoise ? `` `` Because , sire , it is my highest hope upon earth that I have been chosen to lift up your mind towards loftier things -- -that mind the greatness and nobility of which none know more than I . `` `` And is my love so base , then ? `` `` You have wasted too much of your life and of your thoughts upon woman 's love . And now , sire , the years steal on and the day is coming when even you will be called upon to give an account of your actions , and of the innermost thoughts of your heart . I would see you spend the time that is left to you , sire , in building up the Church , in showing a noble example to your subjects , and in repairing any evil which that example may have done in the past . `` The king sank back into his chair with a groan . `` Forever the same , '' said he . `` Why , you are worse than Father la Chaise and Bossuet . `` `` Nay , nay , '' said she gaily , with the quick tact in which she never failed . `` I have wearied you , when you have stooped to honour my little room with your presence . That is indeed ingratitude , and it were a just punishment if you were to leave me in solitude to-morrow , and so cut off all the light of my day . But tell me , sire , how go the works at Marly ? I am all on fire to know whether the great fountain will work . `` `` Yes , the fountain plays well , but Mansard has thrown the right wing too far back . I have made him a good architect , but I have still much to teach him . I showed him his fault on the plan this morning , and he promised to amend it . `` `` And what will the change cost , sire ? `` `` Some millions of livres , but then the view will be much improved from the south side . I have taken in another mile of ground in that direction , for there were a number of poor folk living there , and their hovels were far from pretty . `` `` And why have you not ridden to-day , sire ? '' '' Pah ! it brings me no pleasure . There was a time when my blood was stirred by the blare of the horn and the rush of the hoofs , but now it is all wearisome to me . `` `` And hawking too ? `` `` Yes ; I shall hawk no more . `` `` But , sire , you must have amusement . `` `` What is so dull as an amusement which has ceased to amuse ? I know not how it is . When I was but a lad , and my mother and I were driven from place to place , with the Fronde at war with us and Paris in revolt , with our throne and even our lives in danger , all life seemed to be so bright , so new , and so full of interest . Now that there is no shadow , and that my voice is the first in France , as France 's is in Europe , all is dull and lacking in flavour . What use is it to have all pleasure before me , when it turns to wormwood when it is tasted ? `` `` True pleasure , sire , lies rather in the inward life , the serene mind , the easy conscience . And then , as we grow older , is it not natural that our minds should take a graver bent ? We might well reproach ourselves if it were not so , for it would show that we had not learned the lesson of life . `` `` It may be so , and yet it is sad and weary when nothing amuses . But who is there ? `` `` It is my companion knocking . What is it , mademoiselle ? `` `` Monsieur Corneille , to read to the king , '' said the young lady , opening the door . `` Ah , yes , sire ; I know how foolish is a woman 's tongue , and so I have brought a wiser one than mine here to charm you . Monsieur Racine was to have come , but I hear that he has had a fall from his horse , and he sends his friend in his place . Shall I admit him ? `` `` Oh , as you like , madame , as you like , '' said the king listlessly . At a sign from Mademoiselle Nanon a little peaky man with a shrewd petulant face , and long gray hair falling back over his shoulders , entered the room . He bowed profoundly three times , and then seated himself nervously on the very edge of the stool , from which the lady had removed her work-basket . She smiled and nodded to encourage the poet , while the monarch leaned back in his chair with an air of resignation . `` Shall it be a comedy , or a tragedy , or a burlesque pastoral ? '' Corneille asked timidly . `` Not the burlesque pastoral , '' said the king with decision . `` Such things may be played , but can not be read , since they are for the eye rather than the ear . `` The poet bowed his acquiescence . `` And not the tragedy , monsieur , '' said Madame de Maintenon , glancing up from her tapestry . `` The king has enough that is serious in his graver hours , and so I trust that you will use your talent to amuse him . `` `` Ay , let it be a comedy , '' said Louis ; `` I have not had a good laugh since poor Moliere passed away . `` `` Ah , your Majesty has indeed a fine taste , '' cried the courtier poet . `` Had you condescended to turn your own attention to poetry , where should we all have been then ? `` Louis smiled , for no flattery was too gross to please him . `` Even as you have taught our generals war and our builders art , so you would have set your poor singers a loftier strain . But Mars would hardly deign to share the humbler laurels of Apollo . `` `` I have sometimes thought that I had some such power , '' answered the king complacently ; `` though amid my toils and the burdens of state I have had , as you say , little time for the softer arts . `` `` But you have encouraged others to do what you could so well have done yourself , sire . You have brought out poets as the sun brings out flowers . How many have we not seen -- -Moliere , Boileau , Racine , one greater than the other ? And the others , too , the smaller ones -- -Scarron , so scurrilous and yet so witty -- -Oh , holy Virgin ! what have I said ? `` Madame had laid down her tapestry , and was staring in intense indignation at the poet , who writhed on his stool under the stern rebuke of those cold gray eyes . `` I think , Monsieur Corneille , that you had better go on with your reading , '' said the king dryly . `` Assuredly , sire . Shall I read my play about Darius ? `` `` And who was Darius ? '' asked the king , whose education had been so neglected by the crafty policy of Cardinal Mazarin that he was ignorant of everything save what had come under his own personal observation . `` Darius was King of Persia , sire . `` `` And where is Persia ? `` `` It is a kingdom of Asia . `` `` Is Darius still king there ? `` `` Nay , sire ; he fought against Alexander the Great . `` `` Ah , I have heard of Alexander . He was a famous king and general , was he not ? `` `` Like your Majesty , he both ruled wisely and led his armies victoriously . `` `` And was King of Persia , you say ? `` `` No , sire ; of Macedonia . It was Darius who was King of Persia . `` The king frowned , for the slightest correction was offensive to him . `` You do not seem very clear about the matter , and I confess that it does not interest me deeply , '' said he . `` Pray turn to something else . `` `` There is myPretended Astrologer . `` `` Yes , that will do . `` Corneille commenced to read his comedy , while Madame de Maintenon 's white and delicate fingers picked among the many-coloured silks which she was weaving into her tapestry . From time to time she glanced across , first at the clock and then at the king , who was leaning back , with his lace handkerchief thrown over his face . It was twenty minutes to four now , but she knew that she had put it back half an hour , and that the true time was ten minutes past. '' Tut ! tut ! '' cried the king suddenly . `` There is something amiss there . The second last line has a limp in it , surely . '' It was one of his foibles to pose as a critic , and the wise poet would fall in with his corrections , however unreasonable they might be . `` Which line , sire ? It is indeed an advantage to have one 's faults made clear
