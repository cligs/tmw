Sherlock Holmes took his bottle from the corner of the mantel-piece and his hypodermic syringe from its neat morocco case . With his long , white , nervous fingers he adjusted the delicate needle , and rolled back his left shirt-cuff . For some little time his eyes rested thoughtfully upon the sinewy forearm and wrist all dotted and scarred with innumerable puncture-marks . Finally he thrust the sharp point home , pressed down the tiny piston , and sank back into the velvet-lined arm-chair with a long sigh of satisfaction.Three times a day for many months I had witnessed this performance , but custom had not reconciled my mind to it . On the contrary , from day to day I had become more irritable at the sight , and my conscience swelled nightly within me at the thought that I had lacked the courage to protest . Again and again I had registered a vow that I should deliver my soul upon the subject , but there was that in the cool , nonchalant air of my companion which made him the last man with whom one would care to take anything approaching to a liberty . His great powers , his masterly manner , and the experience which I had had of his many extraordinary qualities , all made me diffident and backward in crossing him.Yet upon that afternoon , whether it was the Beaune which I had taken with my lunch , or the additional exasperation produced by the extreme deliberation of his manner , I suddenly felt that I could hold out no longer . `` Which is it to-day ? '' I asked , -- - '' morphine or cocaine ? `` He raised his eyes languidly from the old black-letter volume which he had opened . `` It is cocaine , '' he said , -- - '' a seven-per-cent . solution . Would you care to try it ? `` `` No , indeed , '' I answered , brusquely . `` My constitution has not got over the Afghan campaign yet . I can not afford to throw any extra strain upon it . `` He smiled at my vehemence . `` Perhaps you are right , Watson , '' he said . `` I suppose that its influence is physically a bad one . I find it , however , so transcendently stimulating and clarifying to the mind that its secondary action is a matter of small moment . `` `` But consider ! '' I said , earnestly . `` Count the cost ! Your brain may , as you say , be roused and excited , but it is a pathological and morbid process , which involves increased tissue-change and may at last leave a permanent weakness . You know , too , what a black reaction comes upon you . Surely the game is hardly worth the candle . Why should you , for a mere passing pleasure , risk the loss of those great powers with which you have been endowed ? Remember that I speak not only as one comrade to another , but as a medical man to one for whose constitution he is to some extent answerable . `` He did not seem offended . On the contrary , he put his finger-tips together and leaned his elbows on the arms of his chair , like one who has a relish for conversation . `` My mind , '' he said , `` rebels at stagnation . Give me problems , give me work , give me the most abstruse cryptogram or the most intricate analysis , and I am in my own proper atmosphere . I can dispense then with artificial stimulants . But I abhor the dull routine of existence . I crave for mental exaltation . That is why I have chosen my own particular profession , -- -or rather created it , for I am the only one in the world . `` `` The only unofficial detective ? '' I said , raising my eyebrows . `` The only unofficial consulting detective , '' he answered . `` I am the last and highest court of appeal in detection . When Gregson or Lestrade or Athelney Jones are out of their depths -- -which , by the way , is their normal state -- -the matter is laid before me . I examine the data , as an expert , and pronounce a specialist 's opinion . I claim no credit in such cases . My name figures in no newspaper . The work itself , the pleasure of finding a field for my peculiar powers , is my highest reward . But you have yourself had some experience of my methods of work in the Jefferson Hope case . `` `` Yes , indeed , '' said I , cordially . `` I was never so struck by anything in my life . I even embodied it in a small brochure with the somewhat fantastic title of 'A Study in Scarlet . ' '' He shook his head sadly . `` I glanced over it , '' said he . `` Honestly , I can not congratulate you upon it . Detection is , or ought to be , an exact science , and should be treated in the same cold and unemotional manner . You have attempted to tinge it with romanticism , which produces much the same effect as if you worked a love-story or an elopement into the fifth proposition of Euclid . `` `` But the romance was there , '' I remonstrated . `` I could not tamper with the facts . `` `` Some facts should be suppressed , or at least a just sense of proportion should be observed in treating them . The only point in the case which deserved mention was the curious analytical reasoning from effects to causes by which I succeeded in unraveling it . `` I was annoyed at this criticism of a work which had been specially designed to please him . I confess , too , that I was irritated by the egotism which seemed to demand that every line of my pamphlet should be devoted to his own special doings . More than once during the years that I had lived with him in Baker Street I had observed that a small vanity underlay my companion 's quiet and didactic manner . I made no remark , however , but sat nursing my wounded leg . I had a Jezail bullet through it some time before , and , though it did not prevent me from walking , it ached wearily at every change of the weather . `` My practice has extended recently to the Continent , '' said Holmes , after a while , filling up his old brier-root pipe . `` I was consulted last week by Francois Le Villard , who , as you probably know , has come rather to the front lately in the French detective service . He has all the Celtic power of quick intuition , but he is deficient in the wide range of exact knowledge which is essential to the higher developments of his art . The case was concerned with a will , and possessed some features of interest . I was able to refer him to two parallel cases , the one at Riga in 1857 , and the other at St. Louis in 1871 , which have suggested to him the true solution . Here is the letter which I had this morning acknowledging my assistance . '' He tossed over , as he spoke , a crumpled sheet of foreign notepaper . I glanced my eyes down it , catching a profusion of notes of admiration , with stray `` magnifiques , '' `` coup-de-maitres , '' and `` tours-de-force , '' all testifying to the ardent admiration of the Frenchman . `` He speaks as a pupil to his master , '' said I . `` Oh , he rates my assistance too highly , '' said Sherlock Holmes , lightly . `` He has considerable gifts himself . He possesses two out of the three qualities necessary for the ideal detective . He has the power of observation and that of deduction . He is only wanting in knowledge ; and that may come in time . He is now translating my small works into French . `` `` Your works ? `` `` Oh , did n't you know ? '' he cried , laughing . `` Yes , I have been guilty of several monographs . They are all upon technical subjects . Here , for example , is one 'Upon the Distinction between the Ashes of the Various Tobaccoes . ' In it I enumerate a hundred and forty forms of cigar- , cigarette- , and pipe-tobacco , with colored plates illustrating the difference in the ash . It is a point which is continually turning up in criminal trials , and which is sometimes of supreme importance as a clue . If you can say definitely , for example , that some murder has been done by a man who was smoking an Indian lunkah , it obviously narrows your field of search . To the trained eye there is as much difference between the black ash of a Trichinopoly and the white fluff of bird's-eye as there is between a cabbage and a potato . `` `` You have an extraordinary genius for minutiae , '' I remarked . `` I appreciate their importance . Here is my monograph upon the tracing of footsteps , with some remarks upon the uses of plaster of Paris as a preserver of impresses . Here , too , is a curious little work upon the influence of a trade upon the form of the hand , with lithotypes of the hands of slaters , sailors , corkcutters , compositors , weavers , and diamond-polishers . That is a matter of great practical interest to the scientific detective , -- -especially in cases of unclaimed bodies , or in discovering the antecedents of criminals . But I weary you with my hobby . `` `` Not at all , '' I answered , earnestly . `` It is of the greatest interest to me , especially since I have had the opportunity of observing your practical application of it . But you spoke just now of observation and deduction . Surely the one to some extent implies the other . `` `` Why , hardly , '' he answered , leaning back luxuriously in his arm-chair , and sending up thick blue wreaths from his pipe . `` For example , observation shows me that you have been to the Wigmore Street Post-Office this morning , but deduction lets me know that when there you dispatched a telegram. '' '' Right ! '' said I . `` Right on both points ! But I confess that I do n't see how you arrived at it . It was a sudden impulse upon my part , and I have mentioned it to no one . `` `` It is simplicity itself , '' he remarked , chuckling at my surprise , -- - '' so absurdly simple that an explanation is superfluous ; and yet it may serve to define the limits of observation and of deduction . Observation tells me that you have a little reddish mould adhering to your instep . Just opposite the Seymour Street Office they have taken up the pavement and thrown up some earth which lies in such a way that it is difficult to avoid treading in it in entering . The earth is of this peculiar reddish tint which is found , as far as I know ,
