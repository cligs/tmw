'' he asked . `` An appointment . `` `` Got your letter ? `` I produced the envelope. '' Right ! '' He seemed to be a person of few words . Following him down the passage I was suddenly interrupted by a small woman , who stepped out from what proved to be the dining-room door . She was a bright , vivacious , dark-eyed lady , more French than English in her type . `` One moment , '' she said . `` You can wait , Austin . Step in here , sir . May I ask if you have met my husband before ? `` `` No , madam , I have not had the honor . `` `` Then I apologize to you in advance . I must tell you that he is a perfectly impossible person -- -absolutely impossible . If you are forewarned you will be the more ready to make allowances . `` `` It is most considerate of you , madam . `` `` Get quickly out of the room if he seems inclined to be violent . Do n't wait to argue with him . Several people have been injured through doing that . Afterwards there is a public scandal and it reflects upon me and all of us . I suppose it was n't about South America you wanted to see him ? `` I could not lie to a lady . `` Dear me ! That is his most dangerous subject . You wo n't believe a word he says -- -I 'm sure I do n't wonder . But do n't tell him so , for it makes him very violent . Pretend to believe him , and you may get through all right . Remember he believes it himself . Of that you may be assured . A more honest man never lived . Do n't wait any longer or he may suspect . If you find him dangerous -- -really dangerous -- -ring the bell and hold him off until I come . Even at his worst I can usually control him . `` With these encouraging words the lady handed me over to the taciturn Austin , who had waited like a bronze statue of discretion during our short interview , and I was conducted to the end of the passage . There was a tap at a door , a bull 's bellow from within , and I was face to face with the Professor.He sat in a rotating chair behind a broad table , which was covered with books , maps , and diagrams . As I entered , his seat spun round to face me . His appearance made me gasp . I was prepared for something strange , but not for so overpowering a personality as this . It was his size which took one 's breath away -- -his size and his imposing presence . His head was enormous , the largest I have ever seen upon a human being . I am sure that his top-hat , had I ever ventured to don it , would have slipped over me entirely and rested on my shoulders . He had the face and beard which I associate with an Assyrian bull ; the former florid , the latter so black as almost to have a suspicion of blue , spade-shaped and rippling down over his chest . The hair was peculiar , plastered down in front in a long , curving wisp over his massive forehead . The eyes were blue-gray under great black tufts , very clear , very critical , and very masterful . A huge spread of shoulders and a chest like a barrel were the other parts of him which appeared above the table , save for two enormous hands covered with long black hair . This and a bellowing , roaring , rumbling voice made up my first impression of the notorious Professor Challenger. '' Well ? '' said he , with a most insolent stare . `` What now ? `` I must keep up my deception for at least a little time longer , otherwise here was evidently an end of the interview . `` You were good enough to give me an appointment , sir , '' said I , humbly , producing his envelope.He took my letter from his desk and laid it out before him . `` Oh , you are the young person who can not understand plain English , are you ? My general conclusions you are good enough to approve , as I understand ? `` `` Entirely , sir -- -entirely ! '' I was very emphatic . `` Dear me ! That strengthens my position very much , does it not ? Your age and appearance make your support doubly valuable . Well , at least you are better than that herd of swine in Vienna , whose gregarious grunt is , however , not more offensive than the isolated effort of the British hog . '' He glared at me as the present representative of the beast . `` They seem to have behaved abominably , '' said I . `` I assure you that I can fight my own battles , and that I have no possible need of your sympathy . Put me alone , sir , and with my back to the wall . G. E. C. is happiest then . Well , sir , let us do what we can to curtail this visit , which can hardly be agreeable to you , and is inexpressibly irksome to me . You had , as I have been led to believe , some comments to make upon the proposition which I advanced in my thesis . `` There was a brutal directness about his methods which made evasion difficult . I must still make play and wait for a better opening . It had seemed simple enough at a distance . Oh , my Irish wits , could they not help me now , when I needed help so sorely ? He transfixed me with two sharp , steely eyes . `` Come , come ! '' he rumbled . `` I am , of course , a mere student , '' said I , with a fatuous smile , `` hardly more , I might say , than an earnest inquirer . At the same time , it seemed to me that you were a little severe upon Weissmann in this matter . Has not the general evidence since that date tended to -- -well , to strengthen his position ? `` `` What evidence ? '' He spoke with a menacing calm . `` Well , of course , I am aware that there is not any what you might call DEFINITE evidence . I alluded merely to the trend of modern thought and the general scientific point of view , if I might so express it . `` He leaned forward with great earnestness . `` I suppose you are aware , '' said he , checking off points upon his fingers , `` that the cranial index is a constant factor ? `` `` Naturally , '' said I . `` And that telegony is still sub judice ? '' '' Undoubtedly . `` `` And that the germ plasm is different from the parthenogenetic egg ? `` `` Why , surely ! '' I cried , and gloried in my own audacity . `` But what does that prove ? '' he asked , in a gentle , persuasive voice . `` Ah , what indeed ? '' I murmured . `` What does it prove ? `` `` Shall I tell you ? '' he cooed . `` Pray do . `` `` It proves , '' he roared , with a sudden blast of fury , `` that you are the damnedest imposter in London -- -a vile , crawling journalist , who has no more science than he has decency in his composition ! `` He had sprung to his feet with a mad rage in his eyes . Even at that moment of tension I found time for amazement at the discovery that he was quite a short man , his head not higher than my shoulder -- -a stunted Hercules whose tremendous vitality had all run to depth , breadth , and brain. '' Gibberish ! '' he cried , leaning forward , with his fingers on the table and his face projecting . `` That 's what I have been talking to you , sir -- -scientific gibberish ! Did you think you could match cunning with me -- -you with your walnut of a brain ? You think you are omnipotent , you infernal scribblers , do n't you ? That your praise can make a man and your blame can break him ? We must all bow to you , and try to get a favorable word , must we ? This man shall have a leg up , and this man shall have a dressing down ! Creeping vermin , I know you ! You 've got out of your station . Time was when your ears were clipped . You 've lost your sense of proportion . Swollen gas-bags ! I 'll keep you in your proper place . Yes , sir , you have n't got over G. E. C. There 's one man who is still your master . He warned you off , but if you WILL come , by the Lord you do it at your own risk . Forfeit , my good Mr. Malone , I claim forfeit ! You have played a rather dangerous game , and it strikes me that you have lost it . `` `` Look here , sir , '' said I , backing to the door and opening it ; `` you can be as abusive as you like . But there is a limit . You shall not assault me . `` `` Shall I not ? '' He was slowly advancing in a peculiarly menacing way , but he stopped now and put his big hands into the side-pockets of a rather boyish short jacket which he wore . `` I have thrown several of you out of the house . You will be the fourth or fifth . Three pound fifteen each -- -that is how it averaged . Expensive , but very necessary . Now , sir , why should you not follow your brethren ? I rather think you must . '' He resumed his unpleasant and stealthy advance , pointing his toes as he walked , like a dancing master.I could have bolted for the hall door , but it would have been too ignominious . Besides , a little glow of righteous anger was springing up within me . I had been hopelessly in the wrong before , but this man 's menaces were putting me in the right . `` I 'll trouble you to keep your hands off , sir . I 'll not stand it . `` `` Dear me ! '' His black moustache lifted and a white fang twinkled in a sneer . `` You wo n't stand it , eh ? `` `` Do n't be such a fool , Professor ! '' I cried . `` What can you hope for ? I 'm fifteen stone , as hard as nails , and play center three-quarter every Saturday for the London Irish . I 'm not the man -- -- -- '' It was at that moment that he rushed me . It was lucky that I had opened the door , or we should have gone through it . We did a Catharine-wheel together down the passage .
