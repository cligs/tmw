, a man passed him leading a pair of horses tired and dusty , with many a strap and buckle hanging down behind them . After him came another leading a second pair , and after him another with a third . They were taking them round to the stables . `` Hullo ! '' cried Ezra , with sudden interest ; `` what 's up ? `` `` The mail 's just in . `` `` Mail from Capetown ? '' '' Yes . `` Ezra quickened his pace and strode down Stockdale Street into the Main Street , which , as the name implies , is the chief thoroughfare of Kimberley . He came out close to the office of theVaal River Advertiser and Diamond Field Gazette . There was a crowd in front of the door . ThisVaal River Advertiserwas a badly conducted newspaper , badly printed upon bad paper , but selling at sixpence a copy , and charging from seven shillings and sixpence to a pound for the insertion of an advertisement . It was edited at present by a certain P. Hector O'Flaherty , who having been successively a dentist , a clerk , a provision merchant , an engineer , and a sign painter , and having failed at each and every one of these employments , had taken to running a newspaper as an easy and profitable occupation . Indeed , as managed by Mr. O'Flaherty , the process was simplicity itself . Having secured by the Monday 's mail copies of the London papers of two months before , he spent Tuesday in cutting extracts from them with the greatest impartiality , chopping away everything which might be of value to him . The Wednesday was occupied in cursing at three black boys who helped to put up the type , and on the Thursday a fresh number of theVaal River Advertiser and Diamond Field Gazettewas given to the world . The remaining three days were devoted by Mr. O'Flaherty to intoxication , but the Monday brought him back once more to soda water and literature.It was seldom , indeed , that theAdvertiseraroused interest enough to cause any one to assemble round the Office . Ezra 's heart gave a quick flutter at the sight , and he gathered himself together like a runner who sees his goal in view . Throwing away his cigar , he hurried on ad joined the little crowd . `` What 's the row ? '' he asked . `` There 's news come by the mail , '' said one or two bystanders . `` Big news . `` `` What sort of news ? `` `` Do n't know yet . `` `` Who said there was news ? '' '' Driver . `` `` Where is he ? `` `` Do n't know . `` `` Who will know about it ? '' '' O'Flaherty . `` Here there was a general shout from the crowd for O'Flaherty , and an irascible-looking man , with a red bloated face and bristling hair came to the office door . `` Now , what the divil d 'ye want ? '' he roared , shaking a quill pen at the crowd . `` What are ye after at all ? Have ye nothing betther to do than to block up the door of a decent office ? `` `` What 's the news ? '' cried a dozen voices . `` The news , is it ? '' roared O'Flaherty , more angrily than ever ; `` and ca n't ye foind out that by paying your sixpences like men , and taking theAdvertoiser ? It 's a paper , though Oi says it as should n't , that would cut out some o ' theseTelegraphsandChroniclesif it was only in London . Begad , instead of encouraging local talent ye spind your toime standing around in the strate , and trying to suck a man 's news out of him for nothing . `` `` Look here , boss , '' said a rough-looking fellow in the front of the crowd , `` you keep your hair on , and do n't get slinging words about too freely , or it may be the worse for you and for your office too . We heard as there was big news , an ' we come down to hear it , but as to gettin ' it without paying , that ai n't our sort . I suppose we can call it square if we each hands in sixpence , which is the price o ' your paper , and then you can tell us what 's on . `` O'Flaherty considered for a moment . `` It 's worth a shillin ' each , '' he said , `` for it plays the divil with the circulation of a paper whin its news gits out too soon . `` `` Well , we wo n't stick at that , '' said the miner . `` What say you , boys ? `` There was a murmur of assent , and a broad-brimmed straw hat was passed rapidly from hand to band . It was half full of silver when it reached O'Flaherty . TheAdvertiserhad never before had such a circulation , for the crowd had rapidly increased during the preceding dialogue , and now numbered some hundreds . `` Thank ye , gintlemen , '' said the editor . `` Well , what 's the news ? '' cried the impatient crowd . `` Sure I have n't opened the bag yet , but I soon will . Whativer it is it 's bound to be there . Hey there , Billy , ye divil 's brat , where 's the mail bag ? `` Thus apostrophized , a sharp little Kaffir came running out with the brown bag , and Mr. O'Flaherty examined it in a leisurely manner , which elicited many an oath from the eager crowd . `` Here 's theStandardand theTimes , '' he said , handing the various papers out to his subordinate . `` Begad , there 's not one of ye knows the expinse of k'aping a great paper loike this going , forebye the brains and no profit at the ind of it . Here 's thePostand theNews . If you were men you 'd put in an advertisement ivery wake , whether ye needed it or not , just to encourage literature . Here 's theCape Argus -- -it 'll be in here whativer it is . `` With great deliberation Mr. Hector O'Flaherty put on a pair of spectacles and folded the paper carefully round , so as to bring the principal page to the front . Then he cleared his throat , with the pomposity which is inseparable with most men from the act of reading aloud . `` Go it , boss ! '' cried his audience encouragingly . `` 'Small-pox at Wellington ' -- -that 's not it , is it ? 'Germany and theVatican ' -- -'Custom House Duties at Port Elizabeth ' -- -'Roosian Advances inCintral Asia ' eh ? Is that it -- -'Discovery of great Diamond Moines ? ' '' '' That 's it , '' roared the crowd ; `` let 's hear about that . '' There was an anxious ring in their voices , and their faces were grave and serious as they looked up at the reader upon the steps of the office . `` 'Diamond moines have been discovered in Roosia , ' '' read O'Flaherty , `` 'which are confidently stated to exceed in riches anything which has existed before . It is ginerally anticipated that this discovery , if confirmed , will have a most prejudicial effect upon the African trade . ' That 's an extract from the London news of theArgus . `` A buzz of ejaculations and comments arose from the crowd . `` Is n't there any more about it ? '' they cried . `` Here 's a later paper , boss , '' said the little Kaffir , who had been diligently looking over the dates.O'Flaherty opened it , and gave a whistle of astonishment . `` Here 's enough to satisfy you , '' he said . `` It 's in big toipe and takes up noigh the whole of the first page . I can only read ye the headings , for we must get to work and have out a special edition . You 'll git details there , an ' it 'll be out in a few hours . Look here at the fuss they 've made about it . '' The editor turned the paper as he spoke , and exhibited a series of large black headings in this style : -- - # # # # # RUSSIAN DIAMOND FIELDS. # # # # # EXTRAORDINARY DISCOVERY BY AN ENGLISHMAN . THREATENED EXTINCTION OF THE CAPE INDUSTRY . GREAT FALL IN PRICES . OPINIONS OF THE LONDON PRESS . FULL DETAILS . `` What d 'ye think of that ? '' cried O'Flaherty , triumphantly , as if he had had some hand in the matter . `` Now I must git off to me work , and you 'll have it all before long in your hands . Ye should bliss your stars that ye have some one among ye to offer ye the convanience of the latest news . Good noight to ye all , '' and he trotted back into his office with his hat and its silver contents in his hand.The crowd broke up into a score of gesticulating chattering groups , and wandered up or down the street . Ezra Girdlestone waited until they had cleared away , and then stepped into the office of theAdvertiser . `` What 's the matter now ? '' asked O'Flaherty , angrily . He was a man who lived in a state of chronic irritation . `` Have you a duplicate of that paper ? `` `` Suppose I have ? `` `` What will you sell it for ? `` `` What will you give ? `` `` Half a sovereign . `` `` A sovereign. '' '' Done ! '' and so Ezra Girdlestone walked out of the office with full details in his hand , and departed to his hotel , where he read the account through very slowly and deliberately . It appeared to be satisfactory , for he chuckled to himself a good deal as he perused it . Having finished it , he folded the paper up , placed it in his breast pocket , and , having ordered his horse , set off to the neighbouring township of Dutoitspan with the intention of carrying the news with him.Ezra had two motives in galloping across the veldt that October night . One was to judge with his own ears and eyes what effect the news would have upon practical men . The other was a desire to gratify that sinister pleasure which an ill-natured man has in being the bearer of evil tidings . They had probably heard the report by this time , but it was unlikely that any details had reached them . No one knew better than young Girdlestone that this message from Europe would bring utter ruin and extinction to many a small capitalist , that it would mean the shattering of a thousand hopes , and the advent of poverty and misery to the men with whom he had been associating . In spite of this knowledge , his heart beat high , as his father 's had done in London , and as he spurred his horse onwards through the darkness , he was hardly able to refrain from shouting and whooping in his
