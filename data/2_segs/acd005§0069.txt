`` `` I regret to say , messieurs , '' observed the seigneur , with no abatement of his courtly manner , `` that it is my belief that they have learned a lesson from our young friend here , and that they are knocking out the heads of the powder-barrels in the store-room . `` But Du Lhut shook his head at the suggestion . `` It is not in a Redskin to waste powder , '' said he . `` It is a deal too precious for them to do that . Ah , listen to that ! `` The yellings and screechings had begun again , but there was a wilder , madder ring in their shrillness , and they were mingled with snatches of song and bursts of laughter. '' Ha ! It is the brandy casks which they have opened , '' cried Du Lhut . `` They were bad before , but they will be fiends out of hell now . `` As he spoke there came another burst of whoops , and high above them a voice calling for mercy . With horror in their eyes the survivors glanced from one to the other . A heavy smell of burning flesh rose from below , and still that dreadful voice shrieking and pleading . Then slowly it quavered away and was silent forever . `` Who was it ? '' whispered De Catinat , his blood running cold in his veins . `` It was Jean Corbeil , I think . `` `` May God rest his soul ! His troubles are over . Would that we were as peaceful as he ! Ah , shoot him ! Shoot ! `` A man had suddenly sprung out at the foot of the stair and had swung his arm as though throwing something . It was the Flemish Bastard . Amos Green 's musket flashed , but the savage had sprung back again as rapidly as he appeared . Something splashed down amongst them and rolled across the floor in the lamp-light. '' Down ! Down ! It is a bomb ! '' cried De CatinatBut it lay at Du Lhut 's feet , and he had seen it clearly . He took a cloth from the table and dropped it over it . `` It is not a bomb , '' said he quietly , `` and itwasJean Corbeil who died . `` For four hours sounds of riot , of dancing and of revelling rose up from the store-house , and the smell of the open brandy casks filled the whole air . More than once the savages quarrelled and fought among themselves , and it seemed as if they had forgotten their enemies above , but the besieged soon found that if they attempted to presume upon this they were as closely watched as ever . The major-domo , Theuriet , passing between a loop-hole and a light , was killed instantly by a bullet from the stockade , and both Amos and the old seigneur had narrow escapes until they blocked all the windows save that which overlooked the river . There was no danger from this one , and , as day was already breaking once more , one or other of the party was forever straining their eyes down the stream in search of the expected succour.Slowly the light crept up the eastern sky , a little line of pearl , then a band of pink , broadening , stretching , spreading , until it shot its warm colour across the heavens , tinging the edges of the drifting clouds . Over the woodlands lay a thin gray vapour , the tops of the high oaks jutting out like dim islands from the sea of haze . Gradually as the light increased the mist shredded off into little ragged wisps , which thinned and drifted away , until at last , as the sun pushed its glowing edge over the eastern forests , it gleamed upon the reds and oranges and purples of the fading leaves , and upon the broad blue river which curled away to the northward . De Catinat , as he stood at the window looking out , was breathing in the healthy resinous scent of the trees , mingled with the damp heavy odour of the wet earth , when suddenly his eyes fell upon a dark spot upon the river to the north of them . `` There is a canoe coming down ! '' he cried . In an instant they had all rushed to the opening , but Du Lhut sprang after them , and pulled them angrily towards the door . `` Do you wish to die before your time ? '' he cried . `` Ay , ay ! '' said Captain Ephraim , who understood the gesture if not the words . `` We must leave a watch on deck . Amos , lad , lie here with me and be ready if they show . `` The two Americans and the old pioneer held the barricade , while the eyes of all the others were turned upon the approaching boat . A groan broke suddenly from the only survivingcensitaire . `` It is an Iroquois canoe ! '' he cried. '' Impossible ! `` `` Alas , your excellency , it is so , and it is the same one which passed us last night . `` `` Ah , then the women have escaped them . `` `` I trust so . But alas , seigneur , I fear that there are more in the canoe now than when they passed us . `` The little group of survivors waited in breathless anxiety while the canoe sped swiftly up the river , with a line of foam on either side of her , and a long forked swirl in the waters behind . They could see that she appeared to be very crowded , but they remembered that the wounded of the other boat were aboard her . On she shot and on , until as she came abreast of the fort she swung round , and the rowers raised their paddles and burst into a shrill yell of derision . The stern of the canoe was turned towards them now , and they saw that two women were seated in it . Even at that distance there was no mistaking the sweet pale face or the dark queenly one beside it . The one was Onega and the other was Adele.Charles de la Noue , Seigneur de Sainte Marie , was a hard and self-contained man , but a groan and a bitter curse burst from him when he saw his Indian wife in the hands of her kinsmen , from whom she could hope for little mercy . Yet even now his old-fashioned courtesy to his guest had made him turn to De Catinat with some words of sympathy , when there was a clatter of wood , something darkened the light of the window , and the young soldier was gone . Without a word he had lowered the ladder and was clambering down it with frantic haste . Then as his feet touched the ground he signalled to his comrades to draw it up again , and dashing into the river he swam towards the canoe . Without arms and without a plan he had but the one thought that his place was by the side of his wife in this , the hour of her danger . Fate should bring him what it brought her , and he swore to himself , as he clove a way with his strong arms , that whether it were life or death they should still share it together.But there was another whose view of duty led him from safety into the face of danger . All night the Franciscan had watched De Catinat as a miser watches his treasure , filled with the thought that this heretic was the one little seed which might spread and spread until it choked the chosen vineyard of the Church . Now when he saw him rush so suddenly down the ladder , every fear was banished from his mind save the overpowering one that he was about to lose his precious charge . He , too , clambered down at the very heels of his prisoner , and rushed into the stream not ten paces behind him.And so the watchers at the window saw the strangest of sights . There , in mid-stream , lay the canoe , with a ring of dark warriors clustering in the stern , and the two women crouching in the midst of them . Swimming madly towards them was De Catinat , rising to the shoulders with the strength of every stroke , and behind him again was the tonsured head of the friar , with his brown capote and long trailing gown floating upon the surface of the water behind him . But in his zeal he had thought too little of his own powers . He was a good swimmer , but he was weighted and hampered by his unwieldy clothes . Slower and slower grew his stroke , lower and lower his head , until at last with a great shriek ofIn manus tuas , Domine ! he threw up his hands , and vanished in the swirl of the river . A minute later the watchers , hoarse with screaming to him to return , saw De Catinat pulled aboard the Iroquois canoe , which was instantly turned and continued its course up the river . `` My God ! '' cried Amos hoarsely . `` They have taken him . He is lost . `` `` I have seen some strange things in these forty years , but never the like of that ! '' said Du Lhut.The seigneur took a little pinch of snuff from his gold box , and flicked the wandering grains from his shirt-front with his dainty lace handkerchief . `` Monsieur de Catinat has acted like a gentleman of France , '' said he . `` If I could swim now as I did thirty years ago , I should be by his side . `` Du Lhut glanced round him and shook his head . `` We are only six now , '' said he . `` I fear they are up to some devilry because they are so very still . `` `` They are leaving the house ! '' cried thecensitaire , who was peeping through one of the side windows . `` What can it mean ? Holy Virgin , is it possible that we are saved ? See how they throng through the trees . They are making for the canoe . Now they are waving their arms and pointing . `` `` There is the gray hat of that mongrel devil amongst them , '' said the captain . `` I would try a shot upon him were it not a waste of powder and lead . `` `` I have hit the mark at as long a range , '' said Amos , pushing his long brown gun through a chink in the barricade which they had thrown across the lower half of the window . `` I would give my next year 's trade to bring him down . `` `` It is forty paces further than my musket would carry , '' remarked Du Lhut , `` but I have seen the English shoot a great way with those long guns . `` Amos took a steady aim , resting his gun upon the window sill , and fired.A shout of delight burst from the little knot of survivors . The FlemishBastard had fallen . But he was on his feet
