thought of my poor little woman and the children that makes me one . Anyhow I went . I guess it will haunt me forever . `` It was a lonely house , twenty miles from here , over the range yonder . I was told off for the door , same as you were last night . They could not trust me with the job . The others went in . When they came out their hands were crimson to the wrists . As we turned away a child was screaming out of the house behind us . It was a boy of five who had seen his father murdered . I nearly fainted with the horror of it , and yet I had to keep a bold and smiling face ; for well I knew that if I did not it would be out of my house that they would come next with their bloody hands and it would be my little Fred that would be screaming for his father . `` But I was a criminal then , part sharer in a murder , lost forever in this world , and lost also in the next . I am a good Catholic ; but the priest would have no word with me when he heard I was a Scowrer , and I am excommunicated from my faith . That 's how it stands with me . And I see you going down the same road , and I ask you what the end is to be . Are you ready to be a cold-blooded murderer also , or can we do anything to stop it ? `` `` What would you do ? '' asked McMurdo abruptly . `` You would not inform ? `` `` God forbid ! '' cried Morris . `` Sure , the very thought would cost me my life . `` `` That 's well , '' said McMurdo . `` I 'm thinking that you are a weak man and that you make too much of the matter . `` `` Too much ! Wait till you have lived here longer . Look down the valley ! See the cloud of a hundred chimneys that overshadows it ! I tell you that the cloud of murder hangs thicker and lower than that over the heads of the people . It is the Valley of Fear , the Valley of Death . The terror is in the hearts of the people from the dusk to the dawn . Wait , young man , and you will learn for yourself . `` `` Well , I 'll let you know what I think when I have seen more , '' said McMurdo carelessly . `` What is very clear is that you are not the man for the place , and that the sooner you sell out -- -if you only get a dime a dollar for what the business is worth -- -the better it will be for you . What you have said is safe with me ; but , by Gar ! if I thought you were an informer -- - '' '' No , no ! '' cried Morris piteously . `` Well , let it rest at that . I 'll bear what you have said in mind , and maybe some day I 'll come back to it . I expect you meant kindly by speaking to me like this . Now I 'll be getting home . `` `` One word before you go , '' said Morris . `` We may have been seen together . They may want to know what we have spoken about. '' '' Ah ! that 's well thought of . `` `` I offer you a clerkship in my store . `` `` And I refuse it . That 's our business . Well , so long , Brother Morris , and may you find things go better with you in the future . `` That same afternoon , as McMurdo sat smoking , lost in thought beside the stove of his sitting-room , the door swung open and its framework was filled with the huge figure of Boss McGinty . He passed the sign , and then seating himself opposite to the young man he looked at him steadily for some time , a look which was as steadily returned . `` I 'm not much of a visitor , Brother McMurdo , '' he said at last . `` I guess I am too busy over the folk that visit me . But I thought I 'd stretch a point and drop down to see you in your own house . `` `` I 'm proud to see you here , Councillor , '' McMurdo answered heartily , bringing his whisky bottle out of the cupboard . `` It 's an honour that I had not expected . `` `` How 's the arm ? '' asked the Boss.McMurdo made a wry face . `` Well , I 'm not forgetting it , '' he said ; `` but it 's worth it . `` `` Yes , it 's worth it , '' the other answered , `` to those that are loyal and go through with it and are a help to the lodge . What were you speaking to Brother Morris about on Miller Hill this morning ? `` The question came so suddenly that it was well that he had his answer prepared . He burst into a hearty laugh . `` Morris did n't know I could earn a living here at home . He sha n't know either ; for he has got too much conscience for the likes of me . But he 's a good-hearted old chap . It was his idea that I was at a loose end , and that he would do me a good turn by offering me a clerkship in a drygoods store . `` `` Oh , that was it ? `` `` Yes , that was it . `` `` And you refused it ? '' '' Sure . Could n't I earn ten times as much in my own bedroom with four hours ' work ? `` `` That 's so . But I would n't get about too much with Morris . `` `` Why not ? `` `` Well , I guess because I tell you not . That 's enough for most folk in these parts . `` `` It may be enough for most folk ; but it ai n't enough for me , Councillor , '' said McMurdo boldly . `` If you are a judge of men , you 'll know that . `` The swarthy giant glared at him , and his hairy paw closed for an instant round the glass as though he would hurl it at the head of his companion . Then he laughed in his loud , boisterous , insincere fashion . `` You 're a queer card , for sure , '' said he . `` Well , if you want reasons , I 'll give them . Did Morris say nothing to you against the lodge ? '' '' No . `` `` Nor against me ? '' '' No . `` `` Well , that 's because he dare n't trust you . But in his heart he is not a loyal brother . We know that well . So we watch him and we wait for the time to admonish him . I 'm thinking that the time is drawing near . There 's no room for scabby sheep in our pen . But if you keep company with a disloyal man , we might think that you were disloyal , too . See ? `` `` There 's no chance of my keeping company with him ; for I dislike the man , '' McMurdo answered . `` As to being disloyal , if it was any man but you he would not use the word to me twice . `` `` Well , that 's enough , '' said McGinty , draining off his glass . `` I came down to give you a word in season , and you 've had it . `` `` I 'd like to know , '' said McMurdo , `` how you ever came to learn that I had spoken with Morris at all ? `` McGinty laughed . `` It 's my business to know what goes on in this township , '' said he . `` I guess you 'd best reckon on my hearing all that passes . Well , time 's up , and I 'll just say -- - '' But his leavetaking was cut short in a very unexpected fashion . With a sudden crash the door flew open , and three frowning , intent faces glared in at them from under the peaks of police caps . McMurdo sprang to his feet and half drew his revolver ; but his arm stopped midway as he became conscious that two Winchester rifles were levelled at his head . A man in uniform advanced into the room , a six-shooter in his hand . It was Captain Marvin , once of Chicago , and now of the Mine Constabulary . He shook his head with a half-smile at McMurdo . `` I thought you 'd be getting into trouble , Mr. Crooked McMurdo of Chicago , '' said he . `` Ca n't keep out of it , can you ? Take your hat and come along with us . `` `` I guess you 'll pay for this , Captain Marvin , '' said McGinty . `` Who are you , I 'd like to know , to break into a house in this fashion and molest honest , law-abiding men ? `` `` You 're standing out in this deal , Councillor McGinty , '' said the police captain . `` We are not out after you , but after this man McMurdo . It is for you to help , not to hinder us in our duty . `` `` He is a friend of mine , and I 'll answer for his conduct , '' said the Boss . `` By all accounts , Mr. McGinty , you may have to answer for your own conduct some of these days , '' the captain answered . `` This man McMurdo was a crook before ever he came here , and he 's a crook still . Cover him , Patrolman , while I disarm him . `` `` There 's my pistol , '' said McMurdo coolly . `` Maybe , Captain Marvin , if you and I were alone and face to face you would not take me so easily . `` `` Where 's your warrant ? '' asked McGinty . `` By Gar ! a man might as well live in Russia as in Vermissa while folk like you are running the police . It 's a capitalist outrage , and you 'll hear more of it , I reckon . `` `` You do what you think is your duty the best way you can , Councillor . We 'll look after ours . `` `` What am I accused of ? '' asked McMurdo . `` Of being concerned in the beating of old Editor Stanger at the Herald office . It was n't your fault that it is n't a murder charge . `` `` Well , if that 's all you have against him , '' cried McGinty with a laugh , `` you can save yourself a deal of trouble by dropping it right now . This man was with me in my saloon playing poker up to midnight ,
