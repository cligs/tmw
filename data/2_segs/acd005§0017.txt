. `` `` Read the passage again . '' `` Et si , quand je lui dis le secret de mon ame , Avec moins de rigueur elle eut traite ma flamme , Dans ma fayon de vivre , et suivant mon humeur , Une autre eut bientot le present de mon coeur . `` `` Yes , the third line has a foot too many . Do you not remark it , madame ? `` `` No ; but I fear that I should make a poor critic . `` `` Your Majesty is perfectly right , '' said Corneille unblushingly . `` I shall mark the passage , and see that it is corrected . `` `` I thought that it was wrong . If I do not write myself , you can see that I have at least got the correct ear . A false quantity jars upon me . It is the same in music . Although I know little of the matter , I can tell a discord where Lully himself would miss it . I have often shown him errors of the sort in his operas , and I have always convinced him that I was right . `` `` I can readily believe it , your Majesty . '' Corneille had picked up his book again , and was about to resume his reading when there came a sharp tap at the door . `` It is his Highness the minister , Monsieur de Louvois , '' saidMademoiselle Nanon . `` Admit him , '' answered Louis . `` Monsieur Corneille , I am obliged to you for what you have read , and I regret that an affair of state will now interrupt your comedy . Some other day perhaps I may have the pleasure of hearing the rest of it . '' He smiled in the gracious fashion which made all who came within his personal influence forget his faults and remember him only as the impersonation of dignity and of courtesy.The poet , with his book under his arm , slipped out , while the famous minister , tall , heavily wigged , eagle-nosed , and commanding , came bowing into the little room . His manner was that of exaggerated politeness , but his haughty face marked only too plainly his contempt for such a chamber and for the lady who dwelt there . She was well aware of the feeling with which he regarded her , but her perfect self-command prevented her from ever by word or look returning his dislike . `` My apartments are indeed honoured to-day , '' said she , rising with outstretched hand . `` Can monsieur condescend to a stool , since I have no fitter seat to offer you in this little doll 's house ? But perhaps I am in the way , if you wish to talk of state affairs to the king . I can easily withdraw into my boudoir . `` `` No , no , nothing of the kind , madame , '' cried Louis . `` It is my wish that you should remain here . What is it , Louvois ? `` `` A messenger arrived from England with despatches , your Majesty , '' answered the minister , his ponderous figure balanced upon the three-legged stool . `` There is very ill feeling there , and there is some talk of a rising . The letter from Lord Sunderland wished to know whether , in case the Dutch took the side of the malcontents , the king might look to France for help . Of course , knowing your Majesty 's mind , I answered unhesitatingly that he might . `` `` You did what ? `` `` I answered , sire , that he might . `` King Louis flushed with anger , and he caught up the tongs from the grate with a motion as though he would have struck his minister with them . Madame sprang from her chair , and laid her hand upon his arm with a soothing gesture . He threw down the tongs again , but his eyes still flashed with passion as he turned them upon Louvois . `` How dared you ? '' he cried . `` But , sire -- - '' '' How dared you , I say ? What ! You venture to answer such a message without consulting me ! How often am I to tell you that I am the state -- - I alone ; that all is to come from me ; and that I am answerable to God only ? What are you ? My instrument ! my tool ! And you venture to act without my authority ! `` `` I thought that I knew your wishes , sire , '' stammered Louvois , whose haughty manner had quite deserted him , and whose face was as white as the ruffles of his shirt . `` You are not there to think about my wishes , sir . You are there to consult them and to obey them . Why is it that I have turned away from my old nobility , and have committed the affairs of my kingdom to men whose names have never been heard of in the history of France , such men as Colbert and yourself ? I have been blamed for it . There was the Duc de St. Simon , who said , the last time that he was at the court , that it was a bourgeois government . So it is . But I wished it to be so , because I knew that the nobles have a way of thinking for themselves , and I ask for no thought but mine in the governing of France . But if my bourgeois are to receive messages and give answers to embassies , then indeed I am to be pitied . I have marked you of late , Louvois . You have grown beyond your station . You take too much upon yourself . See to it that I have not again to complain to you upon this matter . `` The humiliated minister sat as one crushed , with his chin sunk upon his breast . The king muttered and frowned for a few minutes , but the cloud cleared gradually from his face , for his fits of anger were usually as short as they were fierce and sudden . `` You will detain that messenger , Louvois , '' he said at last , in a calm voice . `` Yes , sire . `` `` And we shall see at the council meeting to-morrow that a fitting reply be sent to Lord Sunderland . It would be best perhaps not to be too free with our promises in the matter . These English have ever been a thorn in our sides . If we could leave them among their own fogs with such a quarrel as would keep them busy for a few years , then indeed we might crush this Dutch prince at our leisure . Their last civil war lasted ten years , and their next may do as much . We could carry our frontier to the Rhine long ere that . Eh , Louvois ? `` `` Your armies are ready , sire , on the day that you give the word . `` `` But war is a costly business . I do not wish to have to sell the court plate , as we did the other day . How are the public funds ? `` `` We are not very rich , sire . But there is one way in which money may very readily be gained . There was some talk this morning about the Huguenots , and whether they should dwell any longer in this Catholic kingdom . Now , if they are driven out , and if their property were taken by the state , then indeed your Majesty would at once become the richest monarch in Christendom . `` `` But you were against it this morning , Louvois ? `` `` I had not had time to think of it , sire . `` `` You mean that Father la Chaise and the bishop had not had time to get at you , '' said Louis sharply . `` Ah , Louvois , I have not lived with a court round me all these years without learning how things are done . It is a word to him , and so on to another , and so to a third , and so to the king . When my good fathers of the Church have set themselves to bring anything to pass , I see traces of them at every turn , as one traces a mole by the dirt which it has thrown up . But I will not be moved against my own reason to do wrong to those who , however mistaken they may be , are still the subjects whom God has given me . `` `` I would not have you do so , sire , '' cried Louvois in confusion . The king 's accusation had been so true that he had been unable at the moment even to protest . `` I know but one person , '' continued Louis , glancing across at Madame de Maintenon , `` who has no ambitions , who desires neither wealth nor preferment , and who can therefore never be bribed to sacrifice my interests . That is why I value that person 's opinion so highly . '' He smiled at the lady as he spoke , while his minister cast a glance at her which showed the jealousy which ate into his soul . `` It was my duty to point this out to you , sire , not as a suggestion , but as a possibility , '' said he , rising . `` I fear that I have already taken up too much of your Majesty 's time , and I shall now withdraw . '' Bowing slightly to the lady , and profoundly to the monarch , he walked from the room . `` Louvois grows intolerable , '' said the king . `` I know not where his insolence will end . Were it not that he is an excellent servant , I should have sent him from the court before this . He has his own opinions upon everything . It was but the other day that he would have it that I was wrong when I said that one of the windows in the Trianon was smaller than any of the others . It was the same size , said he . I brought Le Metre with his measures , and of course the window was , as I had said , too small . But I see by your clock that it is four o'clock . I must go . `` `` My clock , sire , is half an hour slow . `` `` Half an hour ! '' The king looked dismayed for an instant , and then began to laugh . `` Nay , in that case , '' said he , `` I had best remain where I am , for it is too late to go , and I can say with a clear conscience that it was the clock 's fault rather than mine . `` `` I trust that it was nothing of very great importance , sire , '' said the lady , with a look of demure triumph in her eyes . `` By no means . `` `` No state affair ? `` `` No , no ; it was only that it was the hour at which
