man who is as strong as an ox and has not a nerve in his body , like Malone here , could hardly get up the stairs before he fell unconscious . Is it likely that anyone could stand seventeen minutes of it , far less hours ? `` `` Unless someone saw it coming and made preparation , same as old friend Challenger did . `` `` That , I think , is hardly probable , '' said Challenger , projecting his beard and sinking his eyelids . `` The combination of observation , inference , and anticipatory imagination which enabled me to foresee the danger is what one can hardly expect twice in the same generation . `` `` Then your conclusion is that everyone is certainly dead ? `` `` There can be little doubt of that . We have to remember , however , that the poison worked from below upwards and would possibly be less virulent in the higher strata of the atmosphere . It is strange , indeed , that it should be so ; but it presents one of those features which will afford us in the future a fascinating field for study . One could imagine , therefore , that if one had to search for survivors one would turn one 's eyes with best hopes of success to some Tibetan village or some Alpine farm , many thousands of feet above the sea level . `` `` Well , considerin ' that there are no railroads and no steamers you might as well talk about survivors in the moon , '' said Lord John . `` But what I 'm askin ' myself is whether it 's really over or whether it 's only half-time . `` Summerlee craned his neck to look round the horizon . `` It seems clear and fine , '' said he in a very dubious voice ; `` but so it did yesterday . I am by no means assured that it is all over . `` Challenger shrugged his shoulders . `` We must come back once more to our fatalism , '' said he . `` If the world has undergone this experience before , which is not outside the range of possibility , it was certainly a very long time ago . Therefore , we may reasonably hope that it will be very long before it occurs again . `` `` That 's all very well , '' said Lord John , `` but if you get an earthquake shock you are mighty likely to have a second one right on the top of it . I think we 'd be wise to stretch our legs and have a breath of air while we have the chance . Since our oxygen is exhausted we may just as well be caught outside as in . `` It was strange the absolute lethargy which had come upon us as a reaction after our tremendous emotions of the last twenty-four hours . It was both mental and physical , a deep-lying feeling that nothing mattered and that everything was a weariness and a profitless exertion . Even Challenger had succumbed to it , and sat in his chair , with his great head leaning upon his hands and his thoughts far away , until Lord John and I , catching him by each arm , fairly lifted him on to his feet , receiving only the glare and growl of an angry mastiff for our trouble . However , once we had got out of our narrow haven of refuge into the wider atmosphere of everyday life , our normal energy came gradually back to us once more.But what were we to begin to do in that graveyard of a world ? Could ever men have been faced with such a question since the dawn of time ? It is true that our own physical needs , and even our luxuries , were assured for the future . All the stores of food , all the vintages of wine , all the treasures of art were ours for the taking . But what were we to *do* ? Some few tasks appealed to us at once , since they lay ready to our hands . We descended into the kitchen and laid the two domestics upon their respective beds . They seemed to have died without suffering , one in the chair by the fire , the other upon the scullery floor . Then we carried in poor Austin from the yard . His muscles were set as hard as a board in the most exaggerated rigor mortis , while the contraction of the fibres had drawn his mouth into a hard sardonic grin . This symptom was prevalent among all who had died from the poison . Wherever we went we were confronted by those grinning faces , which seemed to mock at our dreadful position , smiling silently and grimly at the ill-fated survivors of their race . `` Look here , '' said Lord John , who had paced restlessly about the dining-room whilst we partook of some food , `` I do n't know how you fellows feel about it , but for my part , I simplycan'tsit here and do nothin ' . `` `` Perhaps , '' Challenger answered , `` you would have the kindness to suggest what you think we ought to do . `` `` Get a move on us and see all that has happened . `` `` That is what I should myself propose . `` `` But not in this little country village . We can see from the window all that this place can teach us . `` `` Where should we go , then ? `` `` To London ! `` `` That 's all very well , '' grumbled Summerlee . `` You may be equal to a forty-mile walk , but I 'm not so sure about Challenger , with his stumpy legs , and I am perfectly sure about myself . '' Challenger was very much annoyed . `` If you could see your way , sir , to confining your remarks to your own physical peculiarities , you would find that you had an ample field for comment , '' he cried . `` I had no intention to offend you , my dear Challenger , '' cried our tactless friend . `` You ca n't be held responsible for your own physique . If nature has given you a short , heavy body you can not possibly help having stumpy legs . `` Challenger was too furious to answer . He could only growl and blink and bristle . Lord John hastened to intervene before the dispute became more violent . `` You talk of walking . Why should we walk ? '' said he . `` Do you suggest taking a train ? '' asked Challenger , still simmering . `` What 's the matter with the motor-car ? Why should we not go in that ? `` `` I am not an expert , '' said Challenger , pulling at his beard reflectively . `` At the same time , you are right in supposing that the human intellect in its higher manifestations should be sufficiently flexible to turn itself to anything . Your idea is an excellent one , Lord John . I myself will drive you all to London . `` `` You will do nothing of the kind , '' said Summerlee with decision . `` No , indeed , George ! '' cried his wife . `` You only tried once , and you remember how you crashed through the gate of the garage . `` `` It was a momentary want of concentration , '' said Challenger complacently . `` You can consider the matter settled . I will certainly drive you all to London . `` The situation was relieved by Lord John . `` What 's the car ? '' he asked . `` A twenty-horsepower Humber . `` `` Why , I 've driven one for years , '' said he . `` By George ! '' he added . `` I never thought I 'd live to take the whole human race in one load . There 's just room for five , as I remember it . Get your things on , and I 'll be ready at the door by ten o'clock . `` Sure enough , at the hour named , the car came purring and crackling from the yard with Lord John at the wheel . I took my seat beside him , while the lady , a useful little buffer state , was squeezed in between the two men of wrath at the back . Then Lord John released his brakes , slid his lever rapidly from first to third , and we sped off upon the strangest drive that ever human beings have taken since man first came upon the earth.You are to picture the loveliness of nature upon that August day , the freshness of the morning air , the golden glare of the summer sunshine , the cloudless sky , the luxuriant green of the Sussex woods , and the deep purple of heather-clad downs . As you looked round upon the many-coloured beauty of the scene all thought of a vast catastrophe would have passed from your mind had it not been for one sinister sign -- -the solemn , all-embracing silence . There is a gentle hum of life which pervades a closely-settled country , so deep and constant that one ceases to observe it , as the dweller by the sea loses all sense of the constant murmur of the waves . The twitter of birds , the buzz of insects , the far-off echo of voices , the lowing of cattle , the distant barking of dogs , roar of trains , and rattle of carts -- -all these form one low , unremitting note , striking unheeded upon the ear . We missed it now . This deadly silence was appalling . So solemn was it , so impressive , that the buzz and rattle of our motor-car seemed an unwarrantable intrusion , an indecent disregard of this reverent stillness which lay like a pall over and round the ruins of humanity . It was this grim hush , and the tall clouds of smoke which rose here and there over the country-side from smoldering buildings , which cast a chill into our hearts as we gazed round at the glorious panorama of the Weald.And then there were the dead ! At first those endless groups of drawn and grinning faces filled us with a shuddering horror . So vivid and mordant was the impression that I can live over again that slow descent of the station hill , the passing by the nurse-girl with the two babes , the sight of the old horse on his knees between the shafts , the cabman twisted across his seat , and the young man inside with his hand upon the open door in the very act of springing out . Lower down were six reapers all in a litter , their limbs crossing , their dead , unwinking eyes gazing upwards at the glare of heaven . These things I see as in a photograph . But soon , by the merciful provision of nature , the over-excited nerve ceased to respond . The very vastness of the horror took away from its personal appeal . Individuals merged into groups , groups into crowds , crowds into a universal phenomenon which one soon accepted as the inevitable detail of every scene . Only here and there , where some particularly brutal or grotesque incident caught the attention , did the mind come back
