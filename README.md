tmw - Topic Modeling Workflow
=============================

## What is tmw?

tmw is a python module for topic modeling, including some preprocessing of texts and some postprocessing of topic model data.

## Usage

* Make sure you have Python 3 (tested with 3.4), Mallet (tested with 2.0.7) and TreeTagger installed.
* Make sure you have the Python 3 packages numpy, pandas, matplotlib, lxml, scipy, seaborn, wordcloud. 
* Make sure all necessary files (documents, stoplist) are in one directory (your working directory)
* Download the files tmw.py (the module) and my_tmw.py (the configuration file)
* Set the working directory ("wdir") in the configuration file
* (Optionally, you may adapt the module itself in the "tmw.py" file.) 
* Activate or deactivate functions in the configuration file by un-commenting them as needed
* For each function you want to use, set the parameters as necessary.
* Run the workflow by executing the configuration file in a Python IDE.
