has lived ever in the woods , is sent here to see something of men and cities . Ah , my God ! what can have happened now ? `` A sudden chorus of screams and cries had broken out from the passage beneath , with the shouting of a man and the sound of rushing steps . In an instant De Catinat was half-way down the stairs , and was staring in amazement at the scene in the hall beneath.Two maids stood , screaming at the pitch of their lungs , at either side . In the centre the aged man-servant Pierre , a stern old Calvinist , whose dignity had never before been shaken , was spinning round , waving his arms , and roaring so that he might have been heard at the Louvre . Attached to the gray worsted stocking which covered his fleshless calf was a fluffy black hairy ball , with one little red eye glancing up , and the gleam of two white teeth where it held its grip . At the shrieks , the young stranger , who had gone out to his horse , came rushing back , and plucking the creature off , he slapped it twice across the snout , and plunged it head-foremost back into the leather bag from which it had emerged . `` It is nothing , '' said he , speaking in excellent French ; `` it is only a bear . `` `` Ah , my God ! '' cried Pierre , wiping the drops from his brow . `` Ah , it has aged me five years ! I was at the door , bowing to monsieur , and in a moment it had me from behind . `` `` It was my fault for leaving the bag loose . The creature was but pupped the day we left New York , six weeks come Tuesday . Do I speak with my father 's friend , Monsieur Catinat ? `` `` No , monsieur , '' said the guardsman , from the staircase . `` My uncle is out , but I am Captain de Catinat , at your service , and here is Mademoiselle Catinat , who is your hostess . `` The stranger ascended the stair , and paid his greetings to them both with the air of a man who was as shy as a wild deer , and yet who had steeled himself to carry a thing through . He walked with them to the sitting-room , and then in an instant was gone again , and they heard his feet thudding upon the stairs . Presently he was back , with a lovely glossy skin in his hands . `` The bear is for your father , mademoiselle , '' said he . `` This little skin I have brought from America for you . It is but a trifle , and yet it may serve to make a pair of mocassins or a pouch . `` Adele gave a cry of delight as her hands sank into the depths of its softness . She might well admire it , for no king in the world could have had a finer skin . `` Ah , it is beautiful , monsieur , '' she cried ; `` and what creature is it ? and where did it come from ? `` `` It is a black fox . I shot it myself last fall up near the Iroquois villages at Lake Oneida . `` She pressed it to her cheek , her white face showing up like marble against its absolute blackness . `` I am sorry my father is not here to welcome you , monsieur , '' she said ; `` but I do so very heartily in his place . Your room is above . Pierre will show you to it , if you wish . `` `` My room ? For what ? `` `` Why , monsieur , to sleep in ! `` `` And must I sleep in a room ? `` De Catinat laughed at the gloomy face of the American . `` You shall not sleep there if you do not wish , '' said he.The other brightened at once and stepped across to the further window , which looked down upon the court-yard . `` Ah , '' he cried . `` There is a beech-tree there , mademoiselle , and if I might take my blanket out yonder , I should like it better than any room . In winter , indeed , one must do it , but in summer I am smothered with a ceiling pressing down upon me . `` `` You are not from a town then ? '' said De Catinat . `` My father lives in New York -- -two doors from the house of Peter Stuyvesant , of whom you must have heard . He is a very hardy man , and he can do it , but I -- -even a few days of Albany or of Schenectady are enough for me . My life has been in the woods . `` `` I am sure my father would wish you to sleep where you like and to do what you like , as long as it makes you happy . `` `` I thank you , mademoiselle . Then I shall take my things out there , andI shall groom my horse . `` `` Nay , there is Pierre . `` `` I am used to doing it myself . `` `` Then I will come with you , '' said De Catinat , `` for I would have a word with you . Until to-morrow , then , Adele , farewell ! `` `` Until to-morrow , Amory . `` The two young men passed downstairs together , and the guardsman followed the American out into the yard . `` You have had a long journey , '' he said . `` Yes ; from Rouen . `` `` Are you tired ? `` `` No ; I am seldom tired . `` `` Remain with the lady , then , until her father comes back . `` `` Why do you say that ? `` `` Because I have to go , and she might need a protector . `` The stranger said nothing , but he nodded , and throwing off his black coat , set to work vigorously rubbing down his travel-stained horse.It was the morning after the guardsman had returned to his duties . Eight o'clock had struck on the great clock of Versailles , and it was almost time for the monarch to rise . Through all the long corridors and frescoed passages of the monster palace there was a subdued hum and rustle , with a low muffled stir of preparation , for the rising of the king was a great state function in which many had a part to play . A servant with a steaming silver saucer hurried past , bearing it to Monsieur de St. Quentin , the state barber . Others , with clothes thrown over their arms , bustled down the passage which led to the ante-chamber . The knot of guardsmen in their gorgeous blue and silver coats straightened themselves up and brought their halberds to attention , while the young officer , who had been looking wistfully out of the window at some courtiers who were laughing and chatting on the terraces , turned sharply upon his heel , and strode over to the white and gold door of the royal bedroom.He had hardly taken his stand there before the handle was very gently turned from within , the door revolved noiselessly upon its hinges , and a man slid silently through the aperture , closing it again behind him. '' Hush ! '' said he , with his finger to his thin , precise lips , while his whole clean-shaven face and high-arched brows were an entreaty and a warning . `` The king still sleeps . `` The words were whispered from one to another among the group who had assembled outside the door . The speaker , who was Monsieur Bontems , headvalet de Chambre , gave a sign to the officer of the guard , and led him into the window alcove from which he had lately come . `` Good-morning , Captain de Catinat , '' said he , with a mixture of familiarity and respect in his manner . `` Good-morning , Bontems . How has the king slept ? '' '' Admirably . `` `` But it is his time. '' '' Hardly . `` `` You will not rouse him yet ? `` `` In seven and a half minutes . '' The valet pulled out the little round watch which gave the law to the man whowasthe law to twenty millions of people . `` Who commands at the main guard ? `` `` Major de Brissac . `` `` And you will be here ? `` `` For four hours I attend the king . `` `` Very good . He gave me some instructions for the officer of the guard , when he was alone last night after thepetit coucher . He bade me to say that Monsieur de Vivonne was not to be admitted to thegrand lever . You are to tell him so . `` `` I shall do so . `` `` Then , should a note come fromher -- -you understand me , the new one -- - '' '' Madame de Maintenon ? '' '' Precisely . But it is more discreet not to mention names . Should she send a note , you will take it and deliver it quietly when the king gives you an opportunity . `` `` It shall be done . `` `` But if the other should come , as is possible enough -- -the other , you understand me , the former -- - '' '' Madame de Montespan . `` `` Ah , that soldierly tongue of yours , captain ! Should she come , I say , you will gently bar her way , with courteous words , you understand , but on no account is she to be permitted to enter the royal room . `` `` Very good , Bontems . `` `` And now we have but three minutes . `` He strode through the rapidly increasing group of people in the corridor with an air of proud humility as befitted a man who , if he was a valet , was at least the king of valets , by being the valet of the king . Close by the door stood a line of footmen , resplendent in their powdered wigs , red plush coats , and silver shoulder knots . `` Is the officer of the oven here ? '' asked Bontems . `` Yes , sir , '' replied a functionary who bore in front of him an enamelled tray heaped with pine shavings . `` The opener of the shutters ? `` `` Here , sir . `` `` The remover of the taper ? `` `` Here , sir . `` `` Be ready for the word . '' He turned the handle once more , and slipped into the darkened room.It was a large square apartment , with two high windows upon the further side , curtained across with priceless velvet hangings . Through the chinks the morning sun shot a few little gleams , which widened as they crossed the room to break in bright blurs of light upon the primrose-tinted wall . A large arm-chair stood by the side of the burnt-out fire , shadowed over by the huge marble mantel-piece , the back of which was carried
