tossed it about . Other smaller pieces of wreckage dotted the waters , while innumerable spars and packages were littered over the sands . These were being drawn up and collected in a place of safety by gangs of peasants . I noticed that a couple of broad-winged gulls were hovering and skimming over the scene of the shipwreck , as though many strange things were visible to them beneath the waves . At times we could hear their raucous voices as they cried to one another of what they saw . `` She was a leaky old craft , '' said the captain , looking sadly out to sea , `` but there 's always a feeling of sorrow when we see the last of a ship we have sailed in . Well , well , she would have been broken up in any case , and sold for firewood . `` `` It looks a peaceful scene , '' I remarked . `` Who would imagine that three men lost their lives last night in those very waters ? `` `` Poor fellows , '' said the captain , with feeling . `` Should they be cast up after our departure , I am sure , Mr. West , that you will have them decently interred . `` I was about to make some reply when the mate burst into a loud guffaw , slapping his thigh and choking with merriment . `` If you want to bury them , '' he said , `` you had best look sharp , or they may clear out of the country . You remember what I said last night ? Just look at the top of that 'ere hillock , and tell me whether I was in the right or not ? `` There was a high sand dune some little distance along the coast , and upon the summit of this the figure was standing which had attracted the mate 's attention . The captain threw up his hands in astonishment as his eyes rested upon it . `` By the eternal , '' he shouted , `` it 's Ram Singh himself ! Let us overhaul him ! `` Taking to his heels in his excitement he raced along the beach , followed by the mate and myself , as well as by one or two of the fishermen who had observed the presence of the stranger.The latter , perceiving our approach , came down from his post of observation and walked quietly in our direction , with his head sunk upon his breast , like one who is absorbed in thought.I could not help contrasting our hurried and tumultuous advance with the gravity and dignity of this lonely Oriental , nor was the matter mended when he raised a pair of steady , thoughtful dark eyes and inclined his head in a graceful , sweeping salutation . It seemed to me that we were like a pack of schoolboys in the presence of a master.The stranger 's broad , unruffled brow , his clear , searching gaze , firm-set yet sensitive mouth , and clean-cut , resolute expression , all combined to form the most imposing and noble presence which I had ever known . I could not have imagined that such imperturbable calm and at the same time such a consciousness of latent strength could have been expressed by any human face.He was dressed in a brown velveteen coat , loose , dark trousers , with a shirt that was cut low in the collar , so as to show the muscular , brown neck , and he still wore the red fez which I had noticed the night before.I observed with a feeling of surprise , as we approached him , that none of these garments showed the slightest indication of the rough treatment and wetting which they must have received during their wearer 's submersion and struggle to the shore . `` So you are none the worse for your ducking , '' he said in a pleasant , musical voice , looking from the captain to the mate . `` I hope that your poor sailors have found pleasant quarters . `` `` We are all safe , '' the captain answered . `` But we had given you up for lost -- -you and your two friends . Indeed , I was just making arrangements for your burial with Mr. West here . `` The stranger looked at me and smiled . `` We wo n't give Mr. West that trouble for a little time yet , '' he remarked ; `` my friends and I came ashore all safe , and we have found shelter in a hut a mile or so along the coast . It is lonely down there , but we have everything which we can desire . `` `` We start for Glasgow this afternoon , '' said the captain ; `` I shall be very glad if you will come with us . If you have not been in England before you may find it awkward travelling alone . `` `` We are very much indebted to you for your thoughtfulness , '' Ram Singh answered ; `` but we will not take advantage of your kind offer . Since Nature has driven us here we intend to have a look about us before we leave . `` `` As you like , '' the captain said , shrugging his shoulders . `` I do n't think you are likely to find very much to interest you in this hole of a place . `` `` Very possibly not , '' Ram Singh answered with an amused smile . `` You remember Milton 's lines : 'The mind is its own place , and in itself Can make a hell of Heaven , a heaven of Hell . 'I dare say we can spend a few days here comfortably enough . Indeed , I think you must be wrong in considering this to be a barbarous locality . I am much mistaken if this young gentleman 's father is not Mr. James Hunter West , whose name is known and honoured by the pundits of India . `` `` My father is , indeed , a well-known Sanscrit scholar , '' I answered in astonishment . `` The presence of such a man , '' observed the stranger slowly , `` changes a wilderness into a city . One great mind is surely a higher indication of civilisation than are incalculable leagues of bricks and mortar . `` Your father is hardly so profound as Sir William Jones , or so universal as the Baron Von Hammer-Purgstall , but he combines many of the virtues of each . You may tell him , however , from me that he is mistaken in the analogy which he has traced between the Samoyede and Tamulic word roots . `` `` If you have determined to honour our neighbourhood by a short stay , '' said I , `` you will offend my father very much if you do not put up with him . He represents the laird here , and it is the laird 's privilege , according to our Scottish custom , to entertain all strangers of repute who visit this parish . `` My sense of hospitality prompted me to deliver this invitation , though I could feel the mate twitching at my sleeves as if to warn me that the offer was , for some reason , an objectionable one . His fears were , however , unnecessary , for the stranger signified by a shake of the head that it was impossible for him to accept it . `` My friends and I are very much obliged to you , '' he said , `` but we have our own reasons for remaining where we are . The hut which we occupy is deserted and partly ruined , but we Easterns have trained ourselves to do without most of those things which are looked upon as necessaries in Europe , believing firmly in that wise axiom that a man is rich , not in proportion to what he has , but in proportion to what he can dispense with . A good fisherman supplies us with bread and with herbs , we have clean , dry straw for our couches ; what could man wish for more ? `` `` But you must feel the cold at night , coming straight from the tropics , '' remarked the captain . `` Perhaps our bodies are cold sometimes . We have not noticed it . We have all three spent many years in the Upper Himalayas on the border of the region of eternal snow , so we are not very sensitive to inconveniences of the sort . `` `` At least , '' said I , `` you must allow me to send you over some fish and some meat from our larder . `` `` We are not Christians , '' he answered , `` but Buddhists of the higher school . We do not recognise that man has a moral right to slay an ox or a fish for the gross use of his body . He has not put life into them , and has assuredly no mandate from the Almighty to take life from them save under most pressing need . We could not , therefore , use your gift if you were to send it . `` `` But , sir , '' I remonstrated , `` if in this changeable and inhospitable climate you refuse all nourishing food your vitality will fail you -- -you will die . `` `` We shall die then , '' he answered , with an amused smile . `` And now , Captain Meadows , I must bid you adieu , thanking you for your kindness during the voyage , and you , too , good-bye -- -you will command a ship of your own before the year is out . I trust , Mr. West , that I may see you again before I leave this part of the country . Farewell ! `` He raised his red fez , inclined his noble head with the stately grace which characterised all his actions , and strode away in the direction from which he had come . `` Let me congratulate you , Mr. Hawkins , '' said the captain to the mate as we walked homewards . `` You are to command your own ship within the year . `` `` No such luck ! '' the mate answered , with a pleased smile upon his mahogany face , `` still , there 's no saying how things may come out . What d 'ye think of him , Mr . West ? `` `` Why , '' said I , `` I am very much interested in him . What a magnificent head and bearing he has for a young man . I suppose he can not be more than thirty . `` `` Forty , '' said the mate . `` Sixty , if he is a day , '' remarked Captain Meadows . `` Why , I have heard him talk quite familiarly of the first Afghan war . He was a man then , and that is close on forty years ago. '' '' Wonderful ! '' I ejaculated . `` His skin is as smooth and his eyes are as clear as mine are . He is the superior priest of the three , no doubt . `` `` The inferior , '' said the captain confidently . `` That is why he does all the talking for them . Their minds are too elevated to descend to mere worldly chatter . `` `` They
