John , `` a bridge ! `` `` Exactly , my friends , a bridge ! It is not for nothing that I expended an hour last night in focusing my mind upon the situation . I have some recollection of once remarking to our young friend here that G. E. C. is at his best when his back is to the wall . Last night you will admit that all our backs were to the wall . But where will-power and intellect go together , there is always a way out . A drawbridge had to be found which could be dropped across the abyss . Behold it ! `` It was certainly a brilliant idea . The tree was a good sixty feet in height , and if it only fell the right way it would easily cross the chasm . Challenger had slung the camp axe over his shoulder when he ascended . Now he handed it to me . `` Our young friend has the thews and sinews , '' said he . `` I think he will be the most useful at this task . I must beg , however , that you will kindly refrain from thinking for yourself , and that you will do exactly what you are told . `` Under his direction I cut such gashes in the sides of the trees as would ensure that it should fall as we desired . It had already a strong , natural tilt in the direction of the plateau , so that the matter was not difficult . Finally I set to work in earnest upon the trunk , taking turn and turn with Lord John . In a little over an hour there was a loud crack , the tree swayed forward , and then crashed over , burying its branches among the bushes on the farther side . The severed trunk rolled to the very edge of our platform , and for one terrible second we all thought it was over . It balanced itself , however , a few inches from the edge , and there was our bridge to the unknown.All of us , without a word , shook hands with Professor Challenger , who raised his straw hat and bowed deeply to each in turn . `` I claim the honor , '' said he , `` to be the first to cross to the unknown land -- -a fitting subject , no doubt , for some future historical painting . `` He had approached the bridge when Lord John laid his hand upon his coat . `` My dear chap , '' said he , `` I really can not allow it . `` `` Can not allow it , sir ! '' The head went back and the beard forward . `` When it is a matter of science , do n't you know , I follow your lead because you are by way of bein ' a man of science . But it 's up to you to follow me when you come into my department . `` `` Your department , sir ? `` `` We all have our professions , and soldierin ' is mine . We are , accordin ' to my ideas , invadin ' a new country , which may or may not be chock-full of enemies of sorts . To barge blindly into it for want of a little common sense and patience is n't my notion of management . `` The remonstrance was too reasonable to be disregarded . Challenger tossed his head and shrugged his heavy shoulders . `` Well , sir , what do you propose ? `` `` For all I know there may be a tribe of cannibals waitin ' for lunch-time among those very bushes , '' said Lord John , looking across the bridge . `` It 's better to learn wisdom before you get into a cookin'-pot ; so we will content ourselves with hopin ' that there is no trouble waitin ' for us , and at the same time we will act as if there were . Malone and I will go down again , therefore , and we will fetch up the four rifles , together with Gomez and the other . One man can then go across and the rest will cover him with guns , until he sees that it is safe for the whole crowd to come along . `` Challenger sat down upon the cut stump and groaned his impatience ; but Summerlee and I were of one mind that Lord John was our leader when such practical details were in question . The climb was a more simple thing now that the rope dangled down the face of the worst part of the ascent . Within an hour we had brought up the rifles and a shot-gun . The half-breeds had ascended also , and under Lord John 's orders they had carried up a bale of provisions in case our first exploration should be a long one . We had each bandoliers of cartridges . `` Now , Challenger , if you really insist upon being the first man in , '' said Lord John , when every preparation was complete . `` I am much indebted to you for your gracious permission , '' said the angry Professor ; for never was a man so intolerant of every form of authority . `` Since you are good enough to allow it , I shall most certainly take it upon myself to act as pioneer upon this occasion . `` Seating himself with a leg overhanging the abyss on each side , and his hatchet slung upon his back , Challenger hopped his way across the trunk and was soon at the other side . He clambered up and waved his arms in the air . `` At last ! '' he cried ; `` at last ! `` I gazed anxiously at him , with a vague expectation that some terrible fate would dart at him from the curtain of green behind him . But all was quiet , save that a strange , many-colored bird flew up from under his feet and vanished among the trees.Summerlee was the second . His wiry energy is wonderful in so frail a frame . He insisted upon having two rifles slung upon his back , so that both Professors were armed when he had made his transit . I came next , and tried hard not to look down into the horrible gulf over which I was passing . Summerlee held out the butt-end of his rifle , and an instant later I was able to grasp his hand . As to Lord John , he walked across -- -actually walked without support ! He must have nerves of iron.And there we were , the four of us , upon the dreamland , the lost world , of Maple White . To all of us it seemed the moment of our supreme triumph . Who could have guessed that it was the prelude to our supreme disaster ? Let me say in a few words how the crushing blow fell upon us.We had turned away from the edge , and had penetrated about fifty yards of close brushwood , when there came a frightful rending crash from behind us . With one impulse we rushed back the way that we had come . The bridge was gone ! Far down at the base of the cliff I saw , as I looked over , a tangled mass of branches and splintered trunk . It was our beech tree . Had the edge of the platform crumbled and let it through ? For a moment this explanation was in all our minds . The next , from the farther side of the rocky pinnacle before us a swarthy face , the face of Gomez the half-breed , was slowly protruded . Yes , it was Gomez , but no longer the Gomez of the demure smile and the mask-like expression . Here was a face with flashing eyes and distorted features , a face convulsed with hatred and with the mad joy of gratified revenge . `` Lord Roxton ! '' he shouted . `` Lord John Roxton ! `` `` Well , '' said our companion , `` here I am . `` A shriek of laughter came across the abyss . `` Yes , there you are , you English dog , and there you will remain ! I have waited and waited , and now has come my chance . You found it hard to get up ; you will find it harder to get down . You cursed fools , you are trapped , every one of you ! `` We were too astounded to speak . We could only stand there staring in amazement . A great broken bough upon the grass showed whence he had gained his leverage to tilt over our bridge . The face had vanished , but presently it was up again , more frantic than before . `` We nearly killed you with a stone at the cave , '' he cried ; `` but this is better . It is slower and more terrible . Your bones will whiten up there , and none will know where you lie or come to cover them . As you lie dying , think of Lopez , whom you shot five years ago on the Putomayo River . I am his brother , and , come what will I will die happy now , for his memory has been avenged . '' A furious hand was shaken at us , and then all was quiet.Had the half-breed simply wrought his vengeance and then escaped , all might have been well with him . It was that foolish , irresistible Latin impulse to be dramatic which brought his own downfall . Roxton , the man who had earned himself the name of the Flail of the Lord through three countries , was not one who could be safely taunted . The half-breed was descending on the farther side of the pinnacle ; but before he could reach the ground Lord John had run along the edge of the plateau and gained a point from which he could see his man . There was a single crack of his rifle , and , though we saw nothing , we heard the scream and then the distant thud of the falling body . Roxton came back to us with a face of granite . `` I have been a blind simpleton , '' said he , bitterly , `` It 's my folly that has brought you all into this trouble . I should have remembered that these people have long memories for blood-feuds , and have been more upon my guard . `` `` What about the other one ? It took two of them to lever that tree over the edge . `` `` I could have shot him , but I let him go . He may have had no part in it . Perhaps it would have been better if I had killed him , for he must , as you say , have lent a hand . `` Now that we had the clue to his action , each of us could cast back and remember some sinister act upon the part of the half-breed -- -his constant desire to know our plans , his arrest outside our tent when he was over-hearing them , the furtive looks of hatred which from time to time one or other of us had surprised . We were still discussing it , endeavoring to adjust our minds to these new conditions , when a singular scene in
