were of no avail ; and even then we felt no security until we had pinioned his feet as well as his hands . That done , we rose to our feet breathless and panting . `` We have his cab , '' said Sherlock Holmes . `` It will serve to take him to Scotland Yard . And now , gentlemen , '' he continued , with a pleasant smile , `` we have reached the end of our little mystery . You are very welcome to put any questions that you like to me now , and there is no danger that I will refuse to answer them . `` In the central portion of the great North American Continent there lies an arid and repulsive desert , which for many a long year served as a barrier against the advance of civilisation . From the Sierra Nevada to Nebraska , and from the Yellowstone River in the north to the Colorado upon the south , is a region of desolation and silence . Nor is Nature always in one mood throughout this grim district . It comprises snow-capped and lofty mountains , and dark and gloomy valleys . There are swift-flowing rivers which dash through jagged ca√±ons ; and there are enormous plains , which in winter are white with snow , and in summer are grey with the saline alkali dust . They all preserve , however , the common characteristics of barrenness , inhospitality , and misery.There are no inhabitants of this land of despair . A band of Pawnees or of Blackfeet may occasionally traverse it in order to reach other hunting-grounds , but the hardiest of the braves are glad to lose sight of those awesome plains , and to find themselves once more upon their prairies . The coyote skulks among the scrub , the buzzard flaps heavily through the air , and the clumsy grizzly bear lumbers through the dark ravines , and picks up such sustenance as it can amongst the rocks . These are the sole dwellers in the wilderness.In the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from the northern slope of the Sierra Blanco . As far as the eye can reach stretches the great flat plain-land , all dusted over with patches of alkali , and intersected by clumps of the dwarfish chaparral bushes . On the extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain peaks , with their rugged summits flecked with snow . In this great stretch of country there is no sign of life , nor of anything appertaining to life . There is no bird in the steel-blue heaven , no movement upon the dull , grey earth -- -above all , there is absolute silence . Listen as one may , there is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness ; nothing but silence -- -complete and heart-subduing silence.It has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad plain . That is hardly true . Looking down from the Sierra Blanco , one sees a pathway traced out across the desert , which winds away and is lost in the extreme distance . It is rutted with wheels and trodden down by the feet of many adventurers . Here and there there are scattered white objects which glisten in the sun , and stand out against the dull deposit of alkali . Approach , and examine them ! They are bones : some large and coarse , others smaller and more delicate . The former have belonged to oxen , and the latter to men . For fifteen hundred miles one may trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of those who had fallen by the wayside.Looking down on this very scene , there stood upon the fourth of May , eighteen hundred and forty-seven , a solitary traveller . His appearance was such that he might have been the very genius or demon of the region . An observer would have found it difficult to say whether he was nearer to forty or to sixty . His face was lean and haggard , and the brown parchment-like skin was drawn tightly over the projecting bones ; his long , brown hair and beard were all flecked and dashed with white ; his eyes were sunken in his head , and burned with an unnatural lustre ; while the hand which grasped his rifle was hardly more fleshy than that of a skeleton . As he stood , he leaned upon his weapon for support , and yet his tall figure and the massive framework of his bones suggested a wiry and vigorous constitution . His gaunt face , however , and his clothes , which hung so baggily over his shrivelled limbs , proclaimed what it was that gave him that senile and decrepit appearance . The man was dying -- -dying from hunger and from thirst.He had toiled painfully down the ravine , and on to this little elevation , in the vain hope of seeing some signs of water . Now the great salt plain stretched before his eyes , and the distant belt of savage mountains , without a sign anywhere of plant or tree , which might indicate the presence of moisture . In all that broad landscape there was no gleam of hope . North , and east , and west he looked with wild questioning eyes , and then he realised that his wanderings had come to an end , and that there , on that barren crag , he was about to die . `` Why not here , as well as in a feather bed , twenty years hence , '' he muttered , as he seated himself in the shelter of a boulder.Before sitting down , he had deposited upon the ground his useless rifle , and also a large bundle tied up in a grey shawl , which he had carried slung over his right shoulder . It appeared to be somewhat too heavy for his strength , for in lowering it , it came down on the ground with some little violence . Instantly there broke from the grey parcel a little moaning cry , and from it there protruded a small , scared face , with very bright brown eyes , and two little speckled , dimpled fists . `` You 've hurt me ! '' said a childish voice reproachfully . `` Have I though , '' the man answered penitently , `` I did n't go for to do it . '' As he spoke he unwrapped the grey shawl and extricated a pretty little girl of about five years of age , whose dainty shoes and smart pink frock with its little linen apron all bespoke a mother 's care . The child was pale and wan , but her healthy arms and legs showed that she had suffered less than her companion . `` How is it now ? '' he answered anxiously , for she was still rubbing the towsy golden curls which covered the back of her head . `` Kiss it and make it well , '' she said , with perfect gravity , shoving 19 the injured part up to him . `` That 's what mother used to do . Where 's mother ? `` `` Mother 's gone . I guess you 'll see her before long . `` `` Gone , eh ! '' said the little girl . `` Funny , she did n't say good-bye ; she 'most always did if she was just goin ' over to Auntie 's for tea , and now she 's been away three days . Say , it 's awful dry , ai n't it ? Ai n't there no water , nor nothing to eat ? `` `` No , there ai n't nothing , dearie . You 'll just need to be patient awhile , and then you 'll be all right . Put your head up agin me like that , and then you 'll feel bullier . It ai n't easy to talk when your lips is like leather , but I guess I 'd best let you know how the cards lie . What 's that you 've got ? `` `` Pretty things ! fine things ! '' cried the little girl enthusiastically , holding up two glittering fragments of mica . `` When we goes back to home I 'll give them to brother Bob . `` `` You 'll see prettier things than them soon , '' said the man confidently . `` You just wait a bit . I was going to tell you though -- -you remember when we left the river ? `` `` Oh , yes . `` `` Well , we reckoned we 'd strike another river soon , d 'ye see . But there was somethin ' wrong ; compasses , or map , or somethin ' , and it did n't turn up . Water ran out . Just except a little drop for the likes of you and -- -and -- -- -- '' '' And you could n't wash yourself , '' interrupted his companion gravely , staring up at his grimy visage . `` No , nor drink . And Mr. Bender , he was the fust to go , and then Indian Pete , and then Mrs. McGregor , and then Johnny Hones , and then , dearie , your mother . `` `` Then mother 's a deader too , '' cried the little girl dropping her face in her pinafore and sobbing bitterly . `` Yes , they all went except you and me . Then I thought there was some chance of water in this direction , so I heaved you over my shoulder and we tramped it together . It do n't seem as though we 've improved matters . There 's an almighty small chance for us now ! `` `` Do you mean that we are going to die too ? '' asked the child , checking her sobs , and raising her tear-stained face . `` I guess that 's about the size of it . `` `` Why did n't you say so before ? '' she said , laughing gleefully . `` You gave me such a fright . Why , of course , now as long as we die we 'll be with mother again . `` `` Yes , you will , dearie . `` `` And you too . I 'll tell her how awful good you 've been . I 'll bet she meets us at the door of Heaven with a big pitcher of water , and a lot of buckwheat cakes , hot , and toasted on both sides , like Bob and me was fond of . How long will it be first ? `` `` I do n't know -- -not very long . '' The man 's eyes were fixed upon the northern horizon . In the blue vault of the heaven there had appeared three little specks which increased in size every moment , so rapidly did they approach . They speedily resolved themselves into three large brown birds , which circled over the heads of the two wanderers , and then settled upon some rocks which overlooked them . They were buzzards , the vultures of the west , whose coming is the forerunner of death . `` Cocks and hens , '' cried the little girl gleefully , pointing at their ill-omened forms , and clapping her hands to make them rise . `` Say , did God make this country ? `` `` In course He did , '' said her companion
