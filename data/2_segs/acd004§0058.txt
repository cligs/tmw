I shall never be worthy of her . `` `` By thinking so you become worthy . Is she then of noble birth ? `` `` She is , my lord , '' faltered Alleyne . `` Of a knightly house ? '' '' Yes . `` `` Have a care , Alleyne , have a care ! '' said Sir Nigel , kindly . `` The higher the steed the greater the fall . Hawk not at that which may be beyond thy flight . `` `` My lord , I know little of the ways and usages of the world , '' cried Alleyne , `` but I would fain ask your rede upon the matter . You have known my father and my kin : is not my family one of good standing and repute ? `` `` Beyond all question . `` `` And yet you warn me that I must not place my love too high . `` `` Were Minstead yours , Alleyne , then , by St. Paul ! I can not think that any family in the land would not be proud to take you among them , seeing that you come of so old a strain . But while the Socman lives -- -- -- Ha , by my soul ! if this is not Sir Oliver 's step I am the more mistaken . `` As he spoke , a heavy footfall was heard without , and the portly knight flung open the door and strode into the room . `` Why , my little coz , '' said he , `` I have come across to tell you that I live above the barber 's in the Rue de la Tour , and that there is a venison pasty in the oven and two flasks of the right vintage on the table . By St. James ! a blind man might find the place , for one has but to get in the wind from it , and follow the savory smell . Put on your cloak , then , and come , for Sir Walter Hewett and Sir Robert Briquet , with one or two others , are awaiting us . `` `` Nay , Oliver , I can not be with you , for I must to Montaubon this day . `` `` To Montaubon ? But I have heard that your Company is to come with my forty Winchester rascals to Dax . `` `` If you will take charge of them , Oliver . For I will go to Montaubon with none save my two squires and two archers . Then , when I have found the rest of my Company I shall lead them to Dax . We set forth this morning . `` `` Then I must back to my pasty , '' said Sir Oliver . `` You will find us at Dax , I doubt not , unless the prince throw me into prison , for he is very wroth against me . `` `` And why , Oliver ? '' '' Pardieu ! because I have sent my cartel , gauntlet , and defiance to Sir John Chandos and to Sir William Felton . `` `` To Chandos ? In God 's name , Oliver , why have you done this ? `` `` Because he and the other have used me despitefully . `` `` And how ? `` `` Because they have passed me over in choosing those who should joust for England . Yourself and Audley I could pass , coz , for you are mature men ; but who are Wake , and Percy , and Beauchamp ? By my soul ! I was prodding for my food into a camp-kettle when they were howling for their pap . Is a man of my weight and substance to be thrown aside for the first three half-grown lads who have learned the trick of the tilt-yard ? But hark ye , coz , I think of sending my cartel also to the prince. '' '' Oliver ! Oliver ! You are mad ! `` `` Not I , i ' faith ! I care not a denier whether he be prince or no . By Saint James ! I see that your squire 's eyes are starting from his head like a trussed crab . Well , friend , we are all three men of Hampshire , and not lightly to be jeered at . `` `` Has he jeered at you than ? '' '' Pardieu ! yes , 'Old Sir Oliver 's heart is still stout , ' said one of his court . 'Else had it been out of keeping with the rest of him , ' quoth the prince . 'And his arm is strong , ' said another . 'So is the backbone of his horse , ' quoth the prince . This very day I will send him my cartel and defiance . `` `` Nay , nay , my dear Oliver , '' said Sir Nigel , laying his hand upon his angry friend 's arm . `` There is naught in this , for it was but saying that you were a strong and robust man , who had need of a good destrier . And as to Chandos and Felton , bethink you that if when you yourself were young the older lances had ever been preferred , how would you then have had the chance to earn the good name and fame which you now bear ? You do not ride as light as you did , Oliver , and I ride lighter by the weight of my hair , but it would be an ill thing if in the evening of our lives we showed that our hearts were less true and loyal than of old . If such a knight as Sir Oliver Buttesthorn may turn against his own prince for the sake of a light word , then where are we to look for steadfast faith and constancy ? '' '' Ah ! my dear little coz , it is easy to sit in the sunshine and preach to the man in the shadow . Yet you could ever win me over to your side with that soft voice of yours . Let us think no more of it then . But , holy Mother ! I had forgot the pasty , and it will be as scorched as Judas Iscariot ! Come , Nigel , lest the foul fiend get the better of me again . `` `` For one hour , then ; for we march at mid-day . Tell Aylward , Alleyne , that he is to come with me to Montaubon , and to choose one archer for his comrade . The rest will to Dax when the prince starts , which will be before the feast of the Epiphany . Have Pommers ready at mid-day with my sycamore lance , and place my harness on the sumpter mule . `` With these brief directions , the two old soldiers strode off together , while Alleyne hastened to get all in order for their journey.It was a bright , crisp winter 's day when the little party set off from Bordeaux on their journey to Montaubon , where the missing half of their Company had last been heard of . Sir Nigel and Ford had ridden on in advance , the knight upon his hackney , while his great war-horse trotted beside his squire . Two hours later Alleyne Edricson followed ; for he had the tavern reckoning to settle , and many other duties which fell to him as squire of the body . With him came Aylward and Hordle John , armed as of old , but mounted for their journey upon a pair of clumsy Landes horses , heavy-headed and shambling , but of great endurance , and capable of jogging along all day , even when between the knees of the huge archer , who turned the scale at two hundred and seventy pounds . They took with them the sumpter mules , which carried in panniers the wardrobe and table furniture of Sir Nigel ; for the knight , though neither fop nor epicure , was very dainty in small matters , and loved , however bare the board or hard the life , that his napery should still be white and his spoon of silver.There had been frost during the night , and the white hard road rang loud under their horses ' irons as they spurred through the east gate of the town , along the same broad highway which the unknown French champion had traversed on the day of the jousts . The three rode abreast , Alleyne Edricson with his eyes cast down and his mind distrait , for his thoughts were busy with the conversation which he had had with Sir Nigel in the morning . Had he done well to say so much , or had he not done better to have said more ? What would the knight have said had he confessed to his love for the Lady Maude ? Would he cast him off in disgrace , or might he chide him as having abused the shelter of his roof ? It had been ready upon his tongue to tell him all when Sir Oliver had broken in upon them . Perchance Sir Nigel , with his love of all the dying usages of chivalry , might have contrived some strange ordeal or feat of arms by which his love should be put to the test . Alleyne smiled as he wondered what fantastic and wondrous deed would be exacted from him . Whatever it was , he was ready for it , whether it were to hold the lists in the court of the King of Tartary , to carry a cartel to the Sultan of Baghdad , or to serve a term against the wild heathen of Prussia . Sir Nigel had said that his birth was high enough for any lady , if his fortune could but be amended . Often had Alleyne curled his lip at the beggarly craving for land or for gold which blinded man to the higher and more lasting issues of life . Now it seemed as though it were only by this same land and gold that he might hope to reach his heart 's desire . But then , again , the Socman of Minstead was no friend to the Constable of Twynham Castle . It might happen that , should he amass riches by some happy fortune of war , this feud might hold the two families aloof . Even if Maude loved him , he knew her too well to think that she would wed him without the blessing of her father . Dark and murky was it all , but hope mounts high in youth , and it ever fluttered over all the turmoil of his thoughts like a white plume amid the shock of horsemen.If Alleyne Edricson had enough to ponder over as he rode through the bare plains of Guienne , his two companions were more busy with the present and less thoughtful of the future . Aylward rode for half a mile with his chin upon his shoulder , looking back at a white kerchief which fluttered out of the gable window of a high house which peeped over the corner of the battlements . When at last a dip of the road hid it from his view , he cocked his steel cap , shrugged his broad shoulders , and rode on with laughter in his eyes , and his weather-beaten face all ashine with pleasant memories . John also rode in silence , but his eyes wandered slowly
