tae his ain weepon , '' he says . `` Now I warrant ye could do something wi ' a guid crab-tree cudgel ! `` `` Aye , could I , '' I answered blithely , `` as well as ony lad on the Border . `` `` This is a lonely hoose , '' says he , `` and we might be molested by some rascals . It 's weel tae be ready for whatever may come . Me and you and my son Mordaunt and Mr. Fothergill West of Branksome , who would come if he was required , ought tae be able tae show a bauld face -- -what think ye ? `` `` 'Deed , sir , '' I says , `` feastin ' is aye better than fechtin ' -- -but if ye 'll raise me a pund a month , I 'll no ' shirk my share o ' either . `` `` We wo n't quarrel ower that , '' says he , and agreed tae the extra twal ' pund a year as easy as though it were as many bawbees . Far be it frae me tae think evil , but I couldna help surmisin ' at the time that money that was so lightly pairted wi ' was maybe no ' so very honestly cam by.I 'm no ' a curious or a pryin ' mun by nature , but I was sair puzzled in my ain mind tae tell why it was that the general walked aboot at nicht and what kept him frae his sleep.Weel , ane day I was cleanin ' doon the passages when my e'e fell on a great muckle heap o ' curtains and auld cairpets and sic ' like things that were piled away in a corner , no vera far frae the door o ' the general 's room . A ' o ' a sudden a thocht came intae my heid and I says tae mysel ' : '' Israel , laddie , '' says I , `` what 's tae stop ye frae hidin ' behind that this vera nicht and seein ' the auld mun when he doesna ken human e'e is on him ? `` The mair I thocht o't the mair seemple it appeared , and I made up my mind tae put the idea intae instant execution.When the nicht cam roond I tauld the women-folk that I was bad wi ' the jawache , and would gang airly tae my room . I kenned fine when ance I got there that there was na chance o ' ony ane disturbin ' me , so I waited a wee while , and then when a ' was quiet , I slippit aff my boots and ran doon the ither stair until I cam tae the heap o ' auld clothes , and there I lay doon wi ' ane e'e peepin ' through a kink and a ' the rest covered up wi ' a great , ragged cairpet.There I bided as quiet as a mouse until the general passed me on his road tae bed , and a ' was still in the hoose.My certie ! I wouldna gang through wi ' it again for a ' the siller at the Union Bank of Dumfries , I canna think o't noo withoot feelin ' cauld a ' the way doon my back.It was just awfu ' lyin ' there in the deid silence , waitin ' and waitin ' wi ' never a soond tae break the monotony , except the heavy tickin ' o ' an auld clock somewhere doon the passage.First I would look doon the corridor in the one way , and syne I 'd look doon in t'ither , but it aye seemed to me as though there was something coming up frae the side that I wasna lookin ' at . I had a cauld sweat on my broo , and my hairt was beatin ' twice tae ilka tick o ' the clock , and what feared me most of a ' was that the dust frae the curtains and things was aye gettin ' doon intae my lungs , and it was a ' I could dae tae keep mysel ' frae coughin'.Godsakes ! I wonder my hair wasna grey wi ' a ' that I went through . I wouldna dae it again to be made Lord Provost o ' Glasgie.Weel , it may have been twa o'clock in the mornin ' or maybe a little mair , and I was just thinkin ' that I wasna tae see onything after a ' -- -and I wasna very sorry neither -- -when all o ' a sudden a soond cam tae my ears clear and distinct through the stillness o ' the nicht.I 've been asked afore noo tae describe that soond , but I 've aye foond that it 's no ' vera easy tae gie a clear idea o't , though it was unlike any other soond that ever I hearkened tae . It was a shairp , ringin ' clang , like what could be caused by flippin ' the rim o ' a wineglass , but it was far higher and thinner than that , and had in it , tae , a kind o ' splash , like the tinkle o ' a rain-drop intae a water-butt.In my fear I sat up amang my cairpets , like a puddock among gowan-leaves , and I listened wi ' a ' my ears . A ' was still again noo , except for the dull tickin ' o ' the distant clock.Suddenly the soond cam again , as clear , as shrill , as shairp as ever , and this time the general heard it , for I heard him gie a kind o ' groan , as a tired man might wha has been roosed oot o ' his sleep.He got up frae his bed , and I could make oot a rustling noise , as though he were dressin ' himsel ' , and presently his footfa ' as he began tae walk up and doon in his room.Mysakes ! it didna tak lang for me tae drap doon amang the cairpets again and cover mysel ' ower . There I lay tremblin ' in every limb , and sayin ' as mony prayers as I could mind , wi ' my e'e still peepin ' through the keek-hole , and fixed upon the door o ' the general 's room.I heard the rattle o ' the handle presently , and the door swung slowly open . There was a licht burnin ' in the room beyond , an ' I could just catch a glimpse o ' what seemed tae me like a row o ' swords stuck alang the side o ' the wa ' , when the general stepped oot and shut the door behind him . He was dressed in a dressin ' goon , wi ' a red smokin'-cap on his heid , and a pair o ' slippers wi ' the heels cut off and the taes turned up.For a moment it cam into my held that maybe he was walkin ' in his sleep , but as he cam towards me I could see the glint o ' the licht in his e'en , and his face was a ' twistin ' , like a man that 's in sair distress o ' mind . On my conscience , it gies me the shakes noo when I think o ' his tall figure and his yelley face comin ' sae solemn and silent doon the lang , lone passage.I haud my breath and lay close watchin ' him , but just as he cam tae where I was my vera hairt stood still in my breast , for `` ting ! '' -- -loud and clear , within a yaird o ' me cam the ringin ' , clangin ' soond that I had a'ready hairkened tae.Where it cam frae is mair than I can tell or what was the cause o't . It might ha ' been that the general made it , but I was sair puzzled tae tell hoo , for his honds were baith doon by his side as he passed me . It cam frae his direction , certainly , but it appeared tae me tae come frae ower his heid , but it was siccan a thin , eerie , high-pitched , uncanny kind o ' soond that it wasna easy tae say just exactly where it did come frae.The general tuk nae heed o't , but walked on and was soon oot o ' sicht , and I didna lose a minute in creepin ' oot frae my hidin ' place and scamperin ' awa ' back tae my room , and if a ' the bogies in the Red Sea were trapesin ' up and doon the hale nicht through , I wud never put my heid oot again tae hae a glimpse o ' them.I didna say a word tae anybody aboot what I 'd seen , but I made up my mind that I wudna stay muckle langer at Cloomber Ha ' . Four pund a month is a good wage , but it isna enough tae pay a man for the loss o ' his peace o ' mind , and maybe the loss o ' his soul as weel , for when the deil is aboot ye canna tell what sort o ' a trap he may lay for ye , and though they say that Providence is stronger than him , it 's maybe as weel no ' to risk it.It was clear tae me that the general and his hoose were baith under some curse , and it was fit that that curse should fa ' on them that had earned it , and no ' on a righteous Presbyterian , wha had ever trod the narrow path.My hairt was sair for young Miss Gabriel -- -for she was a bonnie and winsome lassie -- -but for a ' that , I felt that my duty was tae mysel ' and that I should gang forth , even as Lot ganged oot o ' the wicked cities o ' the plain.That awfu ' cling-clang was aye dingin ' in my lugs , and I couldna bear to be alane in the passages for fear o ' hearin ' it ance again . I only wanted a chance or an excuse tae gie the general notice , and tae gang back to some place where I could see Christian folk , and have the kirk within a stone-cast tae fa ' back upon.But it proved tae be ordained that , instead o ' my saying the word , it should come frae the general himsel'.It was ane day aboot the beginning of October , I was comin ' oot o ' the stable , after giein ' its oats tae the horse , when I seed a great muckle loon come hoppin ' on ane leg up the drive , mair like a big , ill-faured craw than a man.When I clapped my een on him I thocht that maybe this was ane of the rascals that the maister had been speakin ' aboot , so withoot mair ado I fetched oot my bit stick with the intention o ' tryin ' it upon the limmer 's heid . He seed me comin ' towards him , and readin ' my intention frae my look maybe , or frae the stick in my hand , he pu'ed oot a lang knife frae his pocket and swore wi ' the most awfu ' oaths that if I didna stan ' back he 'd be
