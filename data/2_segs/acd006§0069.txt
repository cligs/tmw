at the end of it . Instead of that , her eye fell upon the signature of Ezra Girdlestone . What could he have to say to her ? She moved the solitary candle on to the mantelpiece , and read the following note , roughly scribbled upon a coarse piece of paper : -- - # # # # # `` MY DEAR MISS HARSTON . `` `` I am afraid your confinement here has been very irksome to you . I have repeatedly requested my father to alleviate or modify it , but he has invariably refused . As he still persists in his refusal , I wish to offer you my aid , and , to show you that I am your sincere friend in spite of all that has passed , it you could slip out to-night at nine o'clock and meet me by the withered oak at the head of the avenue , I shall see you safe to Bedsworth , and you can , if you wish , go on to Portsmouth by the next train . I shall manage so that you may find the door open by that time . I shall not , of course , go to Portsmouth with you , but shall return here after dropping you at the station . I do this small thing to show you that , hopeless as it may be , the affection which I bear you is still as deep as ever . `` `` Yours , '' # # # # # `` E . GIRDLESTONE . `` Our heroine was so surprised at this epistle that she sat for some time dangling the slip of paper between her fingers and lost in thought . When she glanced round , Rebecca had left the room . She rolled the paper up and threw it into the fire . Ezra , then , was not so hard-hearted as she had thought him . He had used his influence to soften his father . Should she accept this chance of escape , or should she wait some word from her friends ? Perhaps they were already in Bedsworth , but did not know how to communicate with her . If so , this offer of Ezra 's was just what was needed . In any case , she could go on to Portsmouth and telegraph from there to the Dimsdales . It was too good an offer to be refused . She made up her mind that she would accept it . It was past eight now , and nine was the hour . She stood up with the intention of putting on her cloak and her bonnet.This conversation with Rebecca had suggested to Ezra that he might still have influence enough with his father 's ward to induce her to come out of doors , and so put herself within the reach of Burt . He had proposed the plan to his father , who approved of it heartily . The only weak point in his scheme had been the difficulty which might arise in inducing the girl to venture out of the Priory on that tempestuous winter 's night . There was evidently only one incentive strong enough to bring it about , and that was the hope of escape . By harping skilfully upon this string they might lure her into the trap . Ezra and his father composed the letter together , and the former handed it to Mrs. Jorrocks , with a request that she should deliver it.It chanced , however , that Rebecca , keenly alive to any attempt at communication between the young merchant and her mistress , saw the crone hobbling down the passage with the note in her hand . `` What 's that , mother ? '' she asked . `` It 's a letter for her , '' wheezed the old woman , nodding her tremulous head in the direction of Kate 's room . `` I 'll take it up , '' said Rebecca eagerly . `` I am just going up there with her tea . `` `` Thank ye . Them stairs tries my rheumatiz something cruel . `` The maid took the note and carried it upstairs . Instead of taking it straight to her mistress she slipped into her own room and read every word of it . It appeared to confirm her worst suspicions . Here was Ezra asking an interview with the woman whom he had assured her that he hated . It was true that the request was made in measured words and on a plausible pretext . No doubt that was merely to deceive any other eye which might rest upon it . There was an understanding between them , and this was an assignation . The girl walked swiftly up and down the room like a caged tigress , striking her head with her clenched hands in her anger and biting her lip until the blood came . It was some time before she could overcome her agitation sufficiently to deliver the note , and when she did so her mistress , as we have seen , noticed that her manner was nervous and wild . She little dreamed of the struggle which was going on in the dark-eyed girl 's mind against the impulse which urged her to seize her imagined rival by the white throat and choke the life out of her . `` It 's eight o'clock now , '' Ezra was saying downstairs . `` I wonder whether she will come ? `` `` She is sure to come , '' his father said briefly . `` Suppose she did n't ? `` `` In that case we should find other means to bring her out . We have not gone so far , to break down over a trifle at the last moment . `` `` I must have something to drink , '' Ezra said , after a pause , helping himself from the bottle . `` I feel as cold as ice and as nervous as a cat . I ca n't understand how you look so unconcerned . If you were going to sign an invoice or audit an account or anything else in the way of business you could not take it more calmly . I wish the time would come . This waiting is terrible . `` `` Let us pass the time to advantage , '' said John Girdlestone ; and drawing a little fat Bible from his pocket he began to read it aloud in a solemn and sonorous voice . The yellow light illuminated the old merchant 's massive features as he stooped forwards towards the candle . His strongly marked nose and his hollow cheeks gave him a vulture-like aspect , which was increased by the effect of his deep-set glittering eyes.Ezra , leaning back in his chair with the firelight flickering over his haggard but still handsome face , looked across at his father with a puzzled expression . He had never yet been able to determine whether the old man was a consummate hypocrite or a religious monomaniac . Burt lay with his feet in the light of the fire and his head sunk back across the arm of the chair , fast asleep and snoring loudly . `` Is n't it time to wake him up ? '' Ezra asked , interrupting the reading . `` Yes , I think it is , '' his father answered , closing the sacred volume reverently and replacing it in his bosom.Ezra took up the candle and held it over the sleeping man . `` What a brute he looks ! '' he said . `` Did ever you see such an animal in your life ? `` The navvy was certainly not a pretty sight . His muscular arms and legs were all a-sprawl and his head hung back at a strange angle to his body , so that his fiery red beard pointed upwards , exposing all the thick sinewy throat beneath it . His eyes were half open and looked bleared and unhealthy , while his thick lips puffed out with a whistling sound at every expiration . His dirty brown coat was thrown open , and out of one of the pockets protruded a short thick cudgel with a leaden head.John Girdlestone picked it out and tried it in the air . `` I think I could kill an ox with this , '' he said . `` Do n't wave it about *my* head , '' cried Ezra . `` As you stand in the firelight brandishing that stick in your long arms you are less attractive than usual . `` John Girdlestone smiled and replaced the cudgel in the sleeper 's pocket . `` Wake up , Burt , '' he cried , shaking him by the arm . `` It 's half-past eight . `` The navvy started to his feet with an oath and then fell back into his chair , staring round him vacantly , at a loss as to where he might be . His eye fell upon the bottle of Hollands , which was now nearly empty , and he held out his hand to it with an exclamation of recognition . `` I 've been asleep , guv'nor , '' he said hoarsely . `` Must have a dram to set me straight . Did you say it was time for the job . `` `` We have made arrangements by which she will be out by the withered oak at nine o'clock . `` `` That 's not for half an hour , '' cried Burt , in a surly voice . `` You need not have woke me yet . `` `` We 'd better go out there now . She may come rather before the time '' '' Come on , then ! '' said the navvy , buttoning up his coat and rolling a ragged cravat round his throat . `` Who is a-comin ' with me ? `` `` We shall both come , '' answered John Girdlestone firmly . `` You will need help to carry her to the railway line . `` `` Surely Burt can do that himself , '' Ezra remarked . `` She 's not so very heavy . `` Girdlestone drew his son aside . `` Do n't be so foolish , Ezra , '' he said . `` We ca n't trust the half-drunken fellow . It must be done with the greatest carefulness and precision , and no traces left . Our old business watchword was to overlook everything ourselves , and we shall certainly do so now . `` `` It 's a horrible affair ! '' Ezra said , with a shudder . `` I wish I was out of it . `` `` You wo n't think that to-morrow morning when you realize that the firm is saved and no one the wiser . He has gone on . Do n't lose sight of him . `` They both hurried out , and found Burt standing in front of the door . It was blowing half a gale now , and the wind was bitterly cold . There came a melancholy rasping and rustling from the leafless wood , and every now and again a sharp crackling sound would announce that some rotten branch had come crashing down . The clouds drove across the face of the moon , so that at times the cold , clear light silvered the dark wood and the old monastery , while at others all was plunged in darkness . From the open door a broad golden bar was shot across the lawn from the lamp in the hall . The three dark figures
