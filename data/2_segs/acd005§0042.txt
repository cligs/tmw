him . `` I have the same counsel , then , from all of you , '' said he , -- - '' from you , bishop ; from you , father ; from you , madame ; from you , abbe ; and from you , Louvois . Well , if ill come from it , may it not be visited upon me ! But what is this ? `` De Catinat had taken a step forward with his hand outstretched . His ardent , impetuous nature had suddenly broken down all the barriers of caution , and he seemed for the instant to see that countless throng of men , women , and children of his own faith , all unable to say a word for themselves , and all looking to him as their champion and spokesman . He had thought little of such matters when all was well , but now , when danger threatened , the deeper side of his nature was moved , and he felt how light a thing is life and fortune when weighed against a great abiding cause and principle . `` Do not sign it , sire , '' he cried . `` You will live to wish that your hand had withered ere it grasped that pen . I know it , sire . I am sure of it . Consider all these helpless folk -- -the little children , the young girls , the old and the feeble . Their creed is themselves . As well ask the leaves to change the twigs on which they grow . They could not change . At most you could but hope to turn them from honest folk into hypocrites . And why should you do it ? They honour you . They love you . They harm none . They are proud to serve in your armies , to fight for you , to work for you , to build up the greatness of your kingdom . I implore you , sire , to think again before you sign an order which will bring misery and desolation to so many . `` For a moment the king had hesitated as he listened to the short abrupt sentences in which the soldier pleaded for his fellows , but his face hardened again as he remembered how even his own personal entreaty had been unable to prevail with this young dandy of the court . `` France 's religion should be that of France 's king , '' said he , `` and if my own guardsmen thwart me in such a matter , I must find others who will be more faithful . That major 's commission in the mousquetaires must go to Captain de Belmont , Louvois . `` `` Very good , sire . `` `` And De Catinat 's commission may be transferred to LieutenantLabadoyere . `` `` Very good , sire . `` `` And I am to serve you no longer ? `` `` You are too dainty for my service . `` De Catinat 's arms fell listlessly to his side , and his head sunk forward upon his breast . Then , as he realised the ruin of all the hopes of his life , and the cruel injustice with which he had been treated , he broke into a cry of despair , and rushed from the room with the hot tears of impotent anger running down his face . So , sobbing , gesticulating , with coat unbuttoned and hat awry , he burst into the stable where placid Amos Green was smoking his pipe and watching with critical eyes the grooming of the horses . `` What in thunder is the matter now ? '' he asked , holding his pipe by the bowl , while the blue wreaths curled up from his lips . `` This sword , '' cried the Frenchman -- - '' I have no right to wear it ! I shall break it ! `` `` Well , and I 'll break my knife too if it will hearten you up . `` `` And these , '' cried De Catinat , tugging at his silver shoulder-straps , `` they must go . `` `` Ah , you draw ahead of me there , for I never had any . But come , friend , let me know the trouble , that I may see if it may not be mended . `` `` To Paris ! to Paris ! '' shouted the guardsman frantically . `` If I am ruined , I may yet be in time to save them . The horses , quick ! `` It was clear to the American that some sudden calamity had befallen , so he aided his comrade and the grooms to saddle and bridle.Five minutes later they were flying on their way , and in little more than an hour their steeds , all reeking and foam-flecked , were pulled up outside the high house in the Rue St. Martin . De Catinat sprang from his saddle and rushed upstairs , while Amos followed in his own leisurely fashion.The old Huguenot and his beautiful daughter were seated at one side of the great fireplace , her hand in his , and they sprang up together , she to throw herself with a glad cry into the arms of her lover , and he to grasp the hand which his nephew held out to him.At the other side of the fireplace , with a very long pipe in his mouth and a cup of wine upon a settle beside him , sat a strange-looking man , with grizzled hair and beard , a fleshy red projecting nose , and two little gray eyes , which twinkled out from under huge brindled brows . His long thin face was laced and seamed with wrinkles , crossing and recrossing everywhere , but fanning out in hundreds from the corners of his eyes . It was set in an unchanging expression , and as it was of the same colour all over , as dark as the darkest walnut , it might have been some quaint figure-head cut out of a coarse-grained wood . He was clad in a blue serge jacket , a pair of red breeches smeared at the knees with tar , clean gray worsted stockings , large steel buckles over his coarse square-toed shoes , and beside him , balanced upon the top of a thick oaken cudgel , was a weather-stained silver-laced hat . His gray-shot hair was gathered up behind into a short stiff tail , and a seaman 's hanger , with a brass handle , was girded to his waist by a tarnished leather belt.De Catinat had been too occupied to take notice of this singular individual , but Amos Green gave a shout of delight at the sight of him , and ran forward to greet him . The other 's wooden face relaxed so far as to show two tobacco-stained fangs , and , without rising , he held out a great red hand , of the size and shape of a moderate spade . `` Why , Captain Ephraim , '' cried Amos in English , `` who ever would have thought of finding you here ? De Catinat , this is my old friend Ephraim Savage , under whose charge I came here . `` `` Anchor 's apeak , lad , and the hatches down , '' said the stranger , in the peculiar drawling voice which the New Englanders had retained from their ancestors , the English Puritans . `` And when do you sail ? `` `` As soon as your foot is on her deck , if Providence serve us with wind and tide . And how has all gone with thee , Amos ? `` `` Right well . I have much to tell you of . `` `` I trust that you have held yourself apart from all their popish devilry . `` `` Yes , yes , Ephraim . `` `` And have had no truck with the scarlet woman . `` `` No , no ; but what is it now ? `` The grizzled hair was bristling with rage , and the little gray eyes were gleaming from under the heavy tufts . Amos , following their gaze , saw that De Catinat was seated with his arm round Adele , while her head rested upon his shoulder . `` Ah , if I but knew their snip-snap , lippetty-chippetty lingo ! Saw one ever such a sight ! Amos , lad , what is the French for 'a shameless hussy ' ? `` `` Nay , nay , Ephraim . Surely one may see such a sight , and think no harm of it , on our side of the water . `` Never , Amos . In no godly country. '' '' Tut ! I have seen folks courting in New York . `` `` Ah , New York ! I said in no godly country . I can not answer for New York or Virginia . South of Cape Cod , or of New Haven at the furthest , there is no saying what folk will do . Very sure I am that in Boston or Salem or Plymouth she would see the bridewell and he the stocks for half as much . Ah ! '' He shook his head and bent his brows at the guilty couple.But they and their old relative were far too engrossed with their own affairs to give a thought to the Puritan seaman . De Catinat had told his tale in a few short , bitter sentences , the injustice that had been done to him , his dismissal from the king 's service , and the ruin which had come upon the Huguenots of France . Adele , as is the angel instinct of woman , thought only of her lover and his misfortunes as she listened to his story , but the old merchant tottered to his feet when he heard of the revocation of the Edict , and stood with shaking limbs , staring about him in bewilderment . `` What am I to do ? '' he cried . `` What am I to do ? I am too old to begin my life again . `` `` Never fear , uncle , '' said De Catinat heartily . `` There are other lands beyond France . `` `` But not for me . No , no ; I am too old . Lord , but Thy hand is heavy upon Thy servants . Now is the vial opened , and the carved work of the sanctuary thrown down . Ah , what shall I do , and whither shall I turn ? '' He wrung his hands in his perplexity . `` What is amiss with him , then , Amos ? '' asked the seaman . `` Though I know nothing of what he says , yet I can see that he flies a distress signal . `` `` He and his must leave the country , Ephraim . `` `` And why ? `` `` Because they are Protestants , and the king will not abide their creed . `` Ephraim Savage was across the room in an instant , and had enclosed the old merchant 's thin hand in his own great knotted fist . There was a brotherly sympathy in his strong grip and rugged weather-stained face which held up the other 's courage as no words could have done . `` What is the French for 'the scarlet woman , ' Amos ? '' he asked , glancing over his shoulder . `` Tell this man that we shall see him
