hear aboot me or my affairs . I am na sae sure o ' that , for the Stakes is a family weel kenned and respecked on baith sides o ' the Border , and there 's mony in Nithsdale and Annandale as would be gey pleased to hear news o ' the son o ' Archie Stakes , o ' Ecclefechan.I maun e'en do as I 'm tauld , however , for Mr. West 's sake , hoping he 'll no forget me when I chance to hae a favour tae ask . ( 1 ) I 'm no able tae write mysel ' because my feyther sent me oot to scare craws instead o ' sendin ' me tae school , but on the ither hond he brought me up in the preenciples and practice o ' the real kirk o ' the Covenant , for which may the Lord be praised ! It way last May twel'month that the factor body , Maister McNeil , cam ower tae me in the street and speered whether I was in want o ' a place as a coachman and gairdner . As it fell oot I chanced tae be on the look oot for something o ' the sort mysel ' at the time , but I wasna ower quick to let him see that I wanted it . `` Ye can tak it or leave it , '' says he sharp like . `` It 's a guid place , and there 's mony would be glad o't . If ye want it ye can come up tae my office at twa the morn and put your ain questions tae the gentleman . `` That was a ' I could get frae him , for he 's a close man and a hard one at a bargain -- -which shall profit him leetle in the next life , though he lay by a store o ' siller in this . When the day comes there 'll be a hantle o ' factors on the left hand o ' the throne , and I shouldna be surprised if Maister McNeil found himsel ' amang them.Weel , on the morn I gaed up to the office and there I foond the factor and a lang , thin , dour man wi ' grey hair and a face as brown and crinkled as a walnut . He looked hard at me wi ' a pair o ' een that glowed like twa spunks , and then he says , says he : '' You 've been born in these pairts , I understan ' ? `` `` Aye , '' says I , `` and never left them neither . `` `` Never been oot o ' Scotland ? '' he speers . `` Twice to Carlisle fair , '' says I , for I am a man wha loves the truth ; and besides I kenned that the factor would mind my gaeing there , for I bargained fur twa steers and a stirk that he wanted for the stockin ' o ' the Drumleugh Fairm . `` I learn frae Maister McNeil , '' says General Heatherstone -- -for him it was and nane ither -- - '' that ye canna write . `` `` Na , '' says I . `` Nor read ? `` `` Na , '' says I . `` It seems tae me , '' says he , turnin ' tae the factor , `` that this is the vera man I want . Servants is spoilt noo-a-days , '' says he , `` by ower muckle eddication . I hae nae doobt , Stakes , that ye will suit me well enough . Ye 'll hae three pund a month and a ' foond , but I shall resairve the right o ' givin ' ye twenty-four hoors ' notice at any time . How will that suit ye ? `` `` It 's vera different frae my last place , '' says I , discontented-like.And the words were true enough , for auld Fairmer Scott only gave me a pund a month and parritch twice a day . `` Weel , weel , '' says he , `` maybe we 'll gie ye a rise if ye suit . Meanwhile here 's the han'sel shillin ' that Maister McNeil tells me it 's the custom tae give , and I shall expec ' tae see ye at Cloomber on Monday . `` When the Monday cam roond I walked oot tae Cloomber , and a great muckle hoose it is , wi ' a hunderd windows or mair , and space enough tae hide awa ' half the parish.As tae gairdening , there was no gairden for me tae work at , and the horse was never taken oot o ' the stables frae week 's end tae week 's end . I was busy enough for a ' that , for there was a deal o ' fencing tae be put up , and one thing or anither , forbye cleanin ' the knives and brushin ' the boots and such-like jobs as is mair fit for an auld wife than for a grown man.There was twa besides mysel ' in the kitchen , the cook Eliza , and Mary the hoosemaid , puir , benighted beings baith o ' them , wha had wasted a ' their lives in London , and kenned leetle aboot the warld or the ways o ' the flesh.I hadna muckle tae say to them , for they were simple folk who could scarce understand English , and had hardly mair regard for their ain souls than the tods on the moor . When the cook said she didna think muckle o ' John Knox , and the ither that she wouldna give saxpence tae hear the discourse o ' Maister Donald McSnaw o ' the true kirk , I kenned it was time for me tae leave them tae a higher Judge.There was four in family , the general , my leddy , Maister Mordaunt , and Miss Gabriel , and it wasna long before I found that a ' wasna just exactly as it should be . My leddy was as thin and as white as a ghaist , and many 's the time as I 've come on her and found her yammerin ' and greetin ' all by hersel ' . I 've watched her walkin ' up and doon in the wood where she thought nane could see her and wringin ' her honds like one demented.There was the young gentleman , tae , and his sister -- -they baith seemed to hae some trouble on their minds , and the general maist of a ' , for the ithers were up ane day and down anither ; but he was aye the same , wi ' a face as dour and sad as a felon when he feels the tow roond his neck.I speered o ' the hussies in the kitchen whether they kenned what was amiss wi ' the family , but the cook she answered me back that it wasna for her tae inquire into the affairs o ' her superiors , and that it was naething to her as long as she did her work and had her wages . They were puir , feckless bodies , the twa o ' them , and would scarce gie an answer tae a ceevil question , though they could clack lood eneugh when they had a mind.Weel , weeks passed into months and a ' things grew waur instead o ' better in the Hall . The general he got mair nairvous , and his leddy mair melancholy every day , and yet there wasna any quarrel or bickering between them , for when they 've been togither in the breakfast room I used often tae gang round and prune the rose-tree alongside o ' the window , so that I couldna help hearin ' a great pairt o ' their conversation , though sair against the grain.When the young folk were wi ' them they would speak little , but when they had gone they would aye talk as if some waefu ' trial ere aboot to fa ' upon them , though I could never gather from their words what it was that they were afeared o'.I 've heard the general say mair than ance that he wasna frighted o ' death , or any danger that he could face and have done wi ' , but that it was the lang , weary waitin ' and the uncertainty that had taken a ' the strength and the mettle oot o ' him . Then my leddy would console him and tell him that maybe it wasna as bad as he thocht , and that a ' would come richt in the end -- -but a ' her cheery words were clean throwed away upon him.As tae the young folks , I kenned weel that they didna bide in the groonds , and that they were awa ' whenever they got a chance wi ' Maister Fothergill West tae Branksome , but the general was too fu ' o ' his ain troubles tae ken aboot it , and it didna seem tae me that it was pairt o ' my duties either as coachman or as gairdner tae mind the bairns . He should have lairnt that if ye forbid a lassie and a laddie to dae anything it 's just the surest way o ' bringin ' it aboot . The Lord foond that oot in the gairden o ' Paradise , and there 's no muckle change between the folk in Eden and the folk in Wigtown.There 's ane thing that I havena spoke aboot yet , but that should be set doon.The general didna share his room wi ' his wife , but slept a ' alane in a chamber at the far end o ' the hoose , as distant as possible frae every one else . This room was aye lockit when he wasna in it , and naebody was ever allowed tae gang into it . He would mak ' his ain bed , and red it up and dust it a ' by himsel ' , but he wouldna so much as allow one o ' us to set fut on the passage that led tae it.At nicht he would walk a ' ower the hoose , and he had lamps hung in every room and corner , so that no pairt should be dark.Many 's the time frae my room in the garret I 've heard his futsteps comin ' and gangin ' , comin ' and gangin ' doon one passage and up anither frae midnight till cockcraw . It was weary wark to lie listenin ' tae his clatter and wonderin ' whether he was clean daft , or whether maybe he 'd lairnt pagan and idolatrous tricks oot in India , and that his conscience noo was like the worm which gnaweth and dieth not . I 'd ha ' speered frae him whether it wouldna ease him to speak wi ' the holy Donald McSnaw , but it might ha ' been a mistake , and the general wasna a man that you 'd care tae mak ' a mistake wi'.Ane day I was workin ' at the grass border when he comes up and he says , says he : '' Did ye ever have occasion tae fire a pistol , Israel ? '' '' Godsakes ! '' says I , `` I never had siccan a thing in my honds in my life . `` `` Then you 'd best not begin noo , '' says he . `` Every man
