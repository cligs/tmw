desperate men like rats in a hole . He must oppose his simple weapon to the six-shooter and the life-preserver . All these thoughts , and the remembrance of his wife and children at home , and of how easy it would be not to observe the open door , come upon him , and then what does he do ? Why , with the thought of duty in his heart , and his little cudgel in his hand , he goes to what is too often his death , like a valiant high-minded Englishman , who fears the reproach of his own conscience more than pistol bullet , or bludgeon stroke.Which digression may serve to emphasize the fact that these three burly Hampshire policemen , having been placed upon our friends ' track by the ostler of theFlying Bull , and having themselves observed manoeuvres which could only be characterized as suspicious , charged down with such vehemence , that in less time than it takes to tell it , both Tom and the major and Von Baumser were in safe custody . The Nihilist , who had an unextinguishable hatred of the law , and who could never be brought to understand that it might under any circumstances be on his side , pulled himself very straight and held his knife down at his hip as though he meant to use it , while Bulow , of Kiel , likewise assumed an aggressive attitude . Fortunately , however , the appearance of their prisoners and a few hurried words from the major made the inspector in charge understand how the land lay , and he transferred his attention to Burt , on whose wrists he placed the handcuffs . He then listened to a more detailed account of the circumstances from the lips of the major . `` Who is this young lady ? '' he asked , pointing to Kate . `` This is the Miss Harston whom we came to rescue , and for whom no doubt the blow was intended which killed this unhappy girl . `` `` Perhaps , sir , '' said the inspector to Tom , `` you had better take her up to the house . `` `` Thank you , '' said Tom , and went off through the wood with Kate upon his arm . On their way , she told him how , being unable to find her bonnet and cloak , which Rebecca had abstracted , she had determined to keep her appointment without them . Her delay rendered her a little late , however ; but on reaching the withered oak she heard voices and steps in front of her , which she had followed . These had led her to the open gate , and the lighting of the lantern had revealed her to friends and foes . Ere she concluded her story Tom noticed that she leaned more and more heavily upon him , until by the time that they reached the Priory he was obliged to lift her up and carry her to prevent her from falling . The hardships of the last few weeks , and this final terrible and yet most joyful incident of all , had broken down her strength . He bore her into the house , and laying her by the fire in the dining-room , watched tenderly over her , and exhausted his humble stock of medical knowledge in devising remedies for her condition.In the meantime the inspector , having thoroughly grasped the major 's lucid narrative , was taking prompt and energetic measures . `` You go down to the station , Constable Jones , '' he ordered . `` Wire to London , 'John Girdlestone , aged sixty-one , and his son , aged twenty-eight , wanted for murder . Address , Eccleston Square and Fenchurch Street , City . ' Send a description of them . 'Father , six feet one inch in height , hatchet-faced , grey hair and whiskers , deep-set eyes , heavy brows , round shoulders . Son , five feet ten , dark-faced , black eyes , black curly hair , strongly made , legs rather bandy , well dressed , usually wears a dog 's head scarf-pin . ' That ought to do ! `` `` Yes , that 's near enough , '' observed the major . `` Wire to every station along the line to be on the look-out . Send a description to the chief constable of Portsmouth , and have a watch kept on the shipping . That should catch them ! `` `` It vill , '' cried Von Baumser confidentially . `` I 'll bet money dat it vill . '' It was as well that the German 's sporting offer found no takers , otherwise our good friend would have been a poorer man . `` Let us carry the poor soul up to the house , '' the inspector continued , after making careful examination of the ground all round the body.The party assisted in raising the girl up , and in carrying her back along the path by which she had been brought.Burt tramped stolidly along behind with the remaining policeman beside him . The Nihilist brought up the rear with his keen eye fixed upon the navvy , and his knife still ready for use . When they reached the Priory the prisoner was safely locked away in one of the numerous empty rooms , while Rebecca was carried upstairs and laid upon the very bed which had been hers . `` We must search the house , '' the inspector said ; and Mrs. Jorrocks having been brought out of her room , and having forthwith fainted and been revived again , was ordered to accompany the police in their investigation , which she did in a very dazed and stupefied manner . Indeed , not a word could be got from her until , entering the dining-room , she perceived her bottle of Hollands upon the table , on which she raised up her voice and cursed the whole company , from the inspector downwards , with the shrillest volubility of invective . Having satisfied her soul in this manner , she wound up by a perfect shriek of profanity , and breaking away from her guardians , she regained the shelter of her room and locked herself up there , after which they could hear by the drumming of her heels that she went into a violent hysterical attack upon the floor.Kate had , however , recovered sufficiently to be able to show the police the different rooms , and to explain to them which was which . The inspector examined the scanty furniture of Kate 's apartment with great interest . `` You say you have been living here for three weeks ? '' he said . `` Nearly a month , '' Kate answered . `` God help you ! No wonder you look pale and ill. You have a fine prospect from the window . '' He drew the blind aside and looked out into the darkness . A gleam of moonlight lay upon the heaving ocean , and in the centre of this silver streak was a single brown-sailed fishing-boat running to the eastward before the wind . The inspector 's keen eye rested upon it for an instant , and then he dropped the blind and turned away . It never flashed across his mind that the men whom he was hunting down could have chosen that means of escape , and were already beyond his reach.He examined very carefully the rooms of Ezra and of his father . Both had been furnished comfortably , if not solidly , with spring mattresses to their beds and carpets upon the floor . The young man 's room had little in it beyond the mere furniture , which was natural , as his visits were so short . In the merchant 's chamber , however , were many books and papers . On the little square table was a long slip of foolscap covered with complex figures . It appeared to be a statement of his affairs , in which he had been computing the liabilities of the firm . By the side of it was a small calf-bound diary . The inspector glanced over one of the pages and uttered an exclamation of disgust . `` Here are some pretty entries , '' he cried . `` 'Feel the workings of grace within me ! ' 'Prayed that I might be given a livelier interest in the Holy Scriptures ! ' The book 's full of that sort of thing ! '' he added , turning over the leaves . `` The fellow seems to have played the hypocrite even with himself , for he could never have known that other eyes would rest upon this . `` `` Dere 'll be some queer company among de elect if he is dere ! '' VonBaumser remarked . `` What 's all this ? '' asked the inspector , tumbling a heap of clothes out of the corner with his foot . `` Why , here 's a monk 's dress ! `` Kate sprang forward at the words . `` Then I did see him ! '' she cried . `` I had almost persuaded myself that it was a dream . `` `` What was that ? `` Kate told her story as well as she could , and the inspector made notes of it . `` The crafty old dog ! '' he cried . `` No doubt he could reconcile it with his conscience more easily to frighten you to death than to actually kill you . He told you that cock-and-a-bull story to excite your imagination , and then , feeling sure that you would sooner or later try and escape by night , he kept guard in this rig . The only wonder is that he did n't succeed in either killing you or driving you mad with fright . `` `` Never mind now , dear , '' Tom whispered , as he saw the look of fear spring into her eyes at the recollection of what had passed . `` Do n't think of these terrible things . You will soon be safe in Phillimore Gardens in my mother 's arms . In the meanwhile , I think you would be the better for some sleep . `` `` I think I should , Tom . `` `` Are you afraid to sleep in your own room ? `` `` No ; I am afraid of nothing , now that I know you are near me . I knew so well that you would come . I have been expecting you all the evening . `` `` I can never thank my good friends here enough for the help which they have given me ! '' Tom exclaimed , turning to his companions . `` It is I who should thank them , '' said Kate earnestly , `` I have found friends , indeed . Who can say now that the days of chivalry are past ? `` `` Me dear young lady , '' the major answered , bowing with all the innate grace of an Irish gentleman , `` ye have warmed us by what ye say . I personally was , as ye know , under orders which left me no choice but to come . I hope , however , that ye will believe that had Mrs. Scully not occupied the place in me affections which she does , I should still be as prompt as me friends here to hasten to the rescue of a lady . Tobias Clutterbuck may be ould , Miss Harston , but his
