up and was known to no one . In the centre stood the treasure-chest , resting upon two rafters . He lowered it through the hole , and there it lies . He computes the value of the jewels at not less than half a million sterling . `` At the mention of this gigantic sum we all stared at one another open-eyed . Miss Morstan , could we secure her rights , would change from a needy governess to the richest heiress in England . Surely it was the place of a loyal friend to rejoice at such news ; yet I am ashamed to say that selfishness took me by the soul , and that my heart turned as heavy as lead within me . I stammered out some few halting words of congratulation , and then sat downcast , with my head drooped , deaf to the babble of our new acquaintance . He was clearly a confirmed hypochondriac , and I was dreamily conscious that he was pouring forth interminable trains of symptoms , and imploring information as to the composition and action of innumerable quack nostrums , some of which he bore about in a leather case in his pocket . I trust that he may not remember any of the answers which I gave him that night . Holmes declares that he overheard me caution him against the great danger of taking more than two drops of castor oil , while I recommended strychnine in large doses as a sedative . However that may be , I was certainly relieved when our cab pulled up with a jerk and the coachman sprang down to open the door . `` This , Miss Morstan , is Pondicherry Lodge , '' said Mr. Thaddeus Sholto , as he handed her out.It was nearly eleven o'clock when we reached this final stage of our night 's adventures . We had left the damp fog of the great city behind us , and the night was fairly fine . A warm wind blew from the westward , and heavy clouds moved slowly across the sky , with half a moon peeping occasionally through the rifts . It was clear enough to see for some distance , but Thaddeus Sholto took down one of the side-lamps from the carriage to give us a better light upon our way.Pondicherry Lodge stood in its own grounds , and was girt round with a very high stone wall topped with broken glass . A single narrow iron-clamped door formed the only means of entrance . On this our guide knocked with a peculiar postman-like rat-tat . `` Who is there ? '' cried a gruff voice from within . `` It is I , McMurdo . You surely know my knock by this time . `` There was a grumbling sound and a clanking and jarring of keys . The door swung heavily back , and a short , deep-chested man stood in the opening , with the yellow light of the lantern shining upon his protruded face and twinkling distrustful eyes . `` That you , Mr. Thaddeus ? But who are the others ? I had no orders about them from the master . `` `` No , McMurdo ? You surprise me ! I told my brother last night that I should bring some friends . `` `` He ai n't been out o ' his room to-day , Mr. Thaddeus , and I have no orders . You know very well that I must stick to regulations . I can let you in , but your friends must just stop where they are . `` This was an unexpected obstacle . Thaddeus Sholto looked about him in a perplexed and helpless manner . `` This is too bad of you , McMurdo ! '' he said . `` If I guarantee them , that is enough for you . There is the young lady , too . She can not wait on the public road at this hour . `` `` Very sorry , Mr. Thaddeus , '' said the porter , inexorably . `` Folk may be friends o ' yours , and yet no friends o ' the master 's . He pays me well to do my duty , and my duty I 'll do . I do n't know none o ' your friends . `` `` Oh , yes you do , McMurdo , '' cried Sherlock Holmes , genially . `` I do n't think you can have forgotten me . Do n't you remember the amateur who fought three rounds with you at Alison 's rooms on the night of your benefit four years back ? `` `` Not Mr. Sherlock Holmes ! '' roared the prize-fighter . `` God 's truth ! how could I have mistook you ? If instead o ' standin ' there so quiet you had just stepped up and given me that cross-hit of yours under the jaw , I 'd ha ' known you without a question . Ah , you 're one that has wasted your gifts , you have ! You might have aimed high , if you had joined the fancy . `` `` You see , Watson , if all else fails me I have still one of the scientific professions open to me , '' said Holmes , laughing . `` Our friend wo n't keep us out in the cold now , I am sure . `` `` In you come , sir , in you come , -- -you and your friends , '' he answered . `` Very sorry , Mr. Thaddeus , but orders are very strict . Had to be certain of your friends before I let them in . `` Inside , a gravel path wound through desolate grounds to a huge clump of a house , square and prosaic , all plunged in shadow save where a moonbeam struck one corner and glimmered in a garret window . The vast size of the building , with its gloom and its deathly silence , struck a chill to the heart . Even Thaddeus Sholto seemed ill at ease , and the lantern quivered and rattled in his hand . `` I can not understand it , '' he said . `` There must be some mistake . I distinctly told Bartholomew that we should be here , and yet there is no light in his window . I do not know what to make of it . `` `` Does he always guard the premises in this way ? '' asked Holmes . `` Yes ; he has followed my father 's custom . He was the favorite son , you know , and I sometimes think that my father may have told him more than he ever told me . That is Bartholomew 's window up there where the moonshine strikes . It is quite bright , but there is no light from within , I think . `` `` None , '' said Holmes . `` But I see the glint of a light in that little window beside the door . `` `` Ah , that is the housekeeper 's room . That is where old Mrs. Bernstone sits . She can tell us all about it . But perhaps you would not mind waiting here for a minute or two , for if we all go in together and she has no word of our coming she may be alarmed . But hush ! what is that ? `` He held up the lantern , and his hand shook until the circles of light flickered and wavered all round us . Miss Morstan seized my wrist , and we all stood with thumping hearts , straining our ears . From the great black house there sounded through the silent night the saddest and most pitiful of sounds , -- -the shrill , broken whimpering of a frightened woman . `` It is Mrs. Bernstone , '' said Sholto . `` She is the only woman in the house . Wait here . I shall be back in a moment . '' He hurried for the door , and knocked in his peculiar way . We could see a tall old woman admit him , and sway with pleasure at the very sight of him . `` Oh , Mr. Thaddeus , sir , I am so glad you have come ! I am so glad you have come , Mr. Thaddeus , sir ! '' We heard her reiterated rejoicings until the door was closed and her voice died away into a muffled monotone.Our guide had left us the lantern . Holmes swung it slowly round , and peered keenly at the house , and at the great rubbish-heaps which cumbered the grounds . Miss Morstan and I stood together , and her hand was in mine . A wondrous subtle thing is love , for here were we two who had never seen each other before that day , between whom no word or even look of affection had ever passed , and yet now in an hour of trouble our hands instinctively sought for each other . I have marvelled at it since , but at the time it seemed the most natural thing that I should go out to her so , and , as she has often told me , there was in her also the instinct to turn to me for comfort and protection . So we stood hand in hand , like two children , and there was peace in our hearts for all the dark things that surrounded us . `` What a strange place ! '' she said , looking round . `` It looks as though all the moles in England had been let loose in it . I have seen something of the sort on the side of a hill near Ballarat , where the prospectors had been at work . `` `` And from the same cause , '' said Holmes . `` These are the traces of the treasure-seekers . You must remember that they were six years looking for it . No wonder that the grounds look like a gravel-pit . `` At that moment the door of the house burst open , and Thaddeus Sholto came running out , with his hands thrown forward and terror in his eyes . `` There is something amiss with Bartholomew ! '' he cried . `` I am frightened ! My nerves can not stand it . '' He was , indeed , half blubbering with fear , and his twitching feeble face peeping out from the great Astrakhan collar had the helpless appealing expression of a terrified child . `` Come into the house , '' said Holmes , in his crisp , firm way . `` Yes , do ! '' pleaded Thaddeus Sholto . `` I really do not feel equal to giving directions . `` We all followed him into the housekeeper 's room , which stood upon the left-hand side of the passage . The old woman was pacing up and down with a scared look and restless picking fingers , but the sight of Miss Morstan appeared to have a soothing effect upon her . `` God bless your sweet calm face ! '' she cried , with an hysterical sob . `` It does me good to see you . Oh , but I have been sorely tried this day ! `` Our companion patted her thin , work-worn hand , and murmured some few words of kindly womanly comfort which brought the color back into the others bloodless cheeks . `` Master has locked himself in and will not answer me , '' she explained . `` All day I
