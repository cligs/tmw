to my eyes between the leaded bourgeois type of a Times article and the slovenly print of an evening half-penny paper as there could be between your negro and your Esquimau . The detection of types is one of the most elementary branches of knowledge to the special expert in crime , though I confess that once when I was very young I confused the Leeds Mercury with the Western Morning News . But a Times leader is entirely distinctive , and these words could have been taken from nothing else . As it was done yesterday the strong probability was that we should find the words in yesterday 's issue . `` `` So far as I can follow you , then , Mr. Holmes , '' said Sir Henry Baskerville , `` someone cut out this message with a scissors -- - '' '' Nail-scissors , '' said Holmes . `` You can see that it was a very short-bladed scissors , since the cutter had to take two snips over 'keep away . ' '' '' That is so . Someone , then , cut out the message with a pair of short-bladed scissors , pasted it with paste -- - '' '' Gum , '' said Holmes . `` With gum on to the paper . But I want to know why the word 'moor ' should have been written ? `` `` Because he could not find it in print . The other words were all simple and might be found in any issue , but 'moor ' would be less common . `` `` Why , of course , that would explain it . Have you read anything else in this message , Mr . Holmes ? `` `` There are one or two indications , and yet the utmost pains have been taken to remove all clues . The address , you observe is printed in rough characters . But the Times is a paper which is seldom found in any hands but those of the highly educated . We may take it , therefore , that the letter was composed by an educated man who wished to pose as an uneducated one , and his effort to conceal his own writing suggests that that writing might be known , or come to be known , by you . Again , you will observe that the words are not gummed on in an accurate line , but that some are much higher than others . 'Life , ' for example is quite out of its proper place . That may point to carelessness or it may point to agitation and hurry upon the part of the cutter . On the whole I incline to the latter view , since the matter was evidently important , and it is unlikely that the composer of such a letter would be careless . If he were in a hurry it opens up the interesting question why he should be in a hurry , since any letter posted up to early morning would reach Sir Henry before he would leave his hotel . Did the composer fear an interruption -- -and from whom ? `` `` We are coming now rather into the region of guesswork , '' said Dr . Mortimer . `` Say , rather , into the region where we balance probabilities and choose the most likely . It is the scientific use of the imagination , but we have always some material basis on which to start our speculation . Now , you would call it a guess , no doubt , but I am almost certain that this address has been written in a hotel . `` `` How in the world can you say that ? `` `` If you examine it carefully you will see that both the pen and the ink have given the writer trouble . The pen has spluttered twice in a single word and has run dry three times in a short address , showing that there was very little ink in the bottle . Now , a private pen or ink-bottle is seldom allowed to be in such a state , and the combination of the two must be quite rare . But you know the hotel ink and the hotel pen , where it is rare to get anything else . Yes , I have very little hesitation in saying that could we examine the waste-paper baskets of the hotels around Charing Cross until we found the remains of the mutilated Times leader we could lay our hands straight upon the person who sent this singular message . Halloa ! Halloa ! What 's this ? `` He was carefully examining the foolscap , upon which the words were pasted , holding it only an inch or two from his eyes. '' Well ? `` `` Nothing , '' said he , throwing it down . `` It is a blank half-sheet of paper , without even a water-mark upon it . I think we have drawn as much as we can from this curious letter ; and now , Sir Henry , has anything else of interest happened to you since you have been in London ? `` `` Why , no , Mr. Holmes . I think not . `` `` You have not observed anyone follow or watch you ? `` `` I seem to have walked right into the thick of a dime novel , '' said our visitor . `` Why in thunder should anyone follow or watch me ? `` `` We are coming to that . You have nothing else to report to us before we go into this matter ? `` `` Well , it depends upon what you think worth reporting . `` `` I think anything out of the ordinary routine of life well worth reporting . `` Sir Henry smiled . `` I do n't know much of British life yet , for I have spent nearly all my time in the States and in Canada . But I hope that to lose one of your boots is not part of the ordinary routine of life over here . `` `` You have lost one of your boots ? `` `` My dear sir , '' cried Dr. Mortimer , `` it is only mislaid . You will find it when you return to the hotel . What is the use of troubling Mr. Holmes with trifles of this kind ? `` `` Well , he asked me for anything outside the ordinary routine . `` `` Exactly , '' said Holmes , `` however foolish the incident may seem . You have lost one of your boots , you say ? `` `` Well , mislaid it , anyhow . I put them both outside my door last night , and there was only one in the morning . I could get no sense out of the chap who cleans them . The worst of it is that I only bought the pair last night in the Strand , and I have never had them on . `` `` If you have never worn them , why did you put them out to be cleaned ? `` `` They were tan boots and had never been varnished . That was why I put them out . `` `` Then I understand that on your arrival in London yesterday you went out at once and bought a pair of boots ? `` `` I did a good deal of shopping . Dr. Mortimer here went round with me . You see , if I am to be squire down there I must dress the part , and it may be that I have got a little careless in my ways out West . Among other things I bought these brown boots -- -gave six dollars for them -- -and had one stolen before ever I had them on my feet . `` `` It seems a singularly useless thing to steal , '' said Sherlock Holmes . `` I confess that I share Dr. Mortimer 's belief that it will not be long before the missing boot is found . `` `` And , now , gentlemen , '' said the baronet with decision , `` it seems to me that I have spoken quite enough about the little that I know . It is time that you kept your promise and gave me a full account of what we are all driving at . `` `` Your request is a very reasonable one , '' Holmes answered . `` Dr. Mortimer , I think you could not do better than to tell your story as you told it to us . `` Thus encouraged , our scientific friend drew his papers from his pocket and presented the whole case as he had done upon the morning before . Sir Henry Baskerville listened with the deepest attention and with an occasional exclamation of surprise . `` Well , I seem to have come into an inheritance with a vengeance , '' said he when the long narrative was finished . `` Of course , I 've heard of the hound ever since I was in the nursery . It 's the pet story of the family , though I never thought of taking it seriously before . But as to my uncle 's death -- -well , it all seems boiling up in my head , and I ca n't get it clear yet . You do n't seem quite to have made up your mind whether it 's a case for a policeman or a clergyman. '' '' Precisely . `` `` And now there 's this affair of the letter to me at the hotel . I suppose that fits into its place . `` `` It seems to show that someone knows more than we do about what goes on upon the moor , '' said Dr . Mortimer . `` And also , '' said Holmes , `` that someone is not ill-disposed towards you , since they warn you of danger . `` `` Or it may be that they wish , for their own purposes , to scare me away . `` `` Well , of course , that is possible also . I am very much indebted to you , Dr. Mortimer , for introducing me to a problem which presents several interesting alternatives . But the practical point which we now have to decide , Sir Henry , is whether it is or is not advisable for you to go to Baskerville Hall . `` `` Why should I not go ? `` `` There seems to be danger . `` `` Do you mean danger from this family fiend or do you mean danger from human beings ? `` `` Well , that is what we have to find out . `` `` Whichever it is , my answer is fixed . There is no devil in hell , Mr. Holmes , and there is no man upon earth who can prevent me from going to the home of my own people , and you may take that to be my final answer . '' His dark brows knitted and his face flushed to a dusky red as he spoke . It was evident that the fiery temper of the Baskervilles was not extinct in this their last representative . `` Meanwhile , '' said he , `` I have hardly had time to think over all that you have told me . It 's a big thing for a man to have to understand and to decide at one sitting . I should like to have a quiet hour by myself to make up my mind . Now , look here , Mr.
