Mr. Sherlock Holmes , who was usually very late in the mornings , save upon those not infrequent occasions when he was up all night , was seated at the breakfast table . I stood upon the hearth-rug and picked up the stick which our visitor had left behind him the night before . It was a fine , thick piece of wood , bulbous-headed , of the sort which is known as a `` Penang lawyer . '' Just under the head was a broad silver band nearly an inch across . `` To James Mortimer , M.R.C.S. , from his friends of the C.C.H. , '' was engraved upon it , with the date `` 1884 . '' It was just such a stick as the old-fashioned family practitioner used to carry -- -dignified , solid , and reassuring . `` Well , Watson , what do you make of it ? `` Holmes was sitting with his back to me , and I had given him no sign of my occupation . `` How did you know what I was doing ? I believe you have eyes in the back of your head . `` `` I have , at least , a well-polished , silver-plated coffee-pot in front of me , '' said he . `` But , tell me , Watson , what do you make of our visitor 's stick ? Since we have been so unfortunate as to miss him and have no notion of his errand , this accidental souvenir becomes of importance . Let me hear you reconstruct the man by an examination of it . `` `` I think , '' said I , following as far as I could the methods of my companion , `` that Dr. Mortimer is a successful , elderly medical man , well-esteemed since those who know him give him this mark of their appreciation. '' '' Good ! '' said Holmes . `` Excellent ! `` `` I think also that the probability is in favour of his being a country practitioner who does a great deal of his visiting on foot . `` `` Why so ? `` `` Because this stick , though originally a very handsome one has been so knocked about that I can hardly imagine a town practitioner carrying it . The thick-iron ferrule is worn down , so it is evident that he has done a great amount of walking with it . `` `` Perfectly sound ! '' said Holmes . `` And then again , there is the 'friends of the C.C.H . ' I should guess that to be the Something Hunt , the local hunt to whose members he has possibly given some surgical assistance , and which has made him a small presentation in return . `` `` Really , Watson , you excel yourself , '' said Holmes , pushing back his chair and lighting a cigarette . `` I am bound to say that in all the accounts which you have been so good as to give of my own small achievements you have habitually underrated your own abilities . It may be that you are not yourself luminous , but you are a conductor of light . Some people without possessing genius have a remarkable power of stimulating it . I confess , my dear fellow , that I am very much in your debt . `` He had never said as much before , and I must admit that his words gave me keen pleasure , for I had often been piqued by his indifference to my admiration and to the attempts which I had made to give publicity to his methods . I was proud , too , to think that I had so far mastered his system as to apply it in a way which earned his approval . He now took the stick from my hands and examined it for a few minutes with his naked eyes . Then with an expression of interest he laid down his cigarette , and carrying the cane to the window , he looked over it again with a convex lens . `` Interesting , though elementary , '' said he as he returned to his favourite corner of the settee . `` There are certainly one or two indications upon the stick . It gives us the basis for several deductions . `` `` Has anything escaped me ? '' I asked with some self-importance . `` I trust that there is nothing of consequence which I have overlooked ? `` `` I am afraid , my dear Watson , that most of your conclusions were erroneous . When I said that you stimulated me I meant , to be frank , that in noting your fallacies I was occasionally guided towards the truth . Not that you are entirely wrong in this instance . The man is certainly a country practitioner . And he walks a good deal . `` `` Then I was right . `` `` To that extent . `` `` But that was all . `` `` No , no , my dear Watson , not all -- -by no means all . I would suggest , for example , that a presentation to a doctor is more likely to come from a hospital than from a hunt , and that when the initials 'C.C . ' are placed before that hospital the words 'Charing Cross ' very naturally suggest themselves . `` `` You may be right . `` `` The probability lies in that direction . And if we take this as a working hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start our construction of this unknown visitor . `` `` Well , then , supposing that 'C.C.H . ' does stand for 'Charing Cross Hospital , ' what further inferences may we draw ? `` `` Do none suggest themselves ? You know my methods . Apply them ! `` `` I can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man has practised in town before going to the country . `` `` I think that we might venture a little farther than this . Look at it in this light . On what occasion would it be most probable that such a presentation would be made ? When would his friends unite to give him a pledge of their good will ? Obviously at the moment when Dr. Mortimer withdrew from the service of the hospital in order to start a practice for himself . We know there has been a presentation . We believe there has been a change from a town hospital to a country practice . Is it , then , stretching our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the occasion of the change ? `` `` It certainly seems probable . `` `` Now , you will observe that he could not have been on the staff of the hospital , since only a man well-established in a London practice could hold such a position , and such a one would not drift into the country . What was he , then ? If he was in the hospital and yet not on the staff he could only have been a house-surgeon or a house-physician -- -little more than a senior student . And he left five years ago -- -the date is on the stick . So your grave , middle-aged family practitioner vanishes into thin air , my dear Watson , and there emerges a young fellow under thirty , amiable , unambitious , absent-minded , and the possessor of a favourite dog , which I should describe roughly as being larger than a terrier and smaller than a mastiff . `` I laughed incredulously as Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his settee and blew little wavering rings of smoke up to the ceiling . `` As to the latter part , I have no means of checking you , '' said I , `` but at least it is not difficult to find out a few particulars about the man 's age and professional career . '' From my small medical shelf I took down the Medical Directory and turned up the name . There were several Mortimers , but only one who could be our visitor . I read his record aloud . `` Mortimer , James , M.R.C.S. , 1882 , Grimpen , Dartmoor , Devon . House-surgeon , from 1882 to 1884 , at Charing Cross Hospital . Winner of the Jackson prize for Comparative Pathology , with essay entitled 'Is Disease a Reversion ? ' Corresponding member of the Swedish Pathological Society . Author of 'Some Freaks of Atavism ' ( Lancet 1882 ) . 'Do We Progress ? ' ( Journal of Psychology , March , 1883 ) . Medical Officer for the parishes of Grimpen , Thorsley , and High Barrow . '' `` No mention of that local hunt , Watson , '' said Holmes with a mischievous smile , `` but a country doctor , as you very astutely observed . I think that I am fairly justified in my inferences . As to the adjectives , I said , if I remember right , amiable , unambitious , and absent-minded . It is my experience that it is only an amiable man in this world who receives testimonials , only an unambitious one who abandons a London career for the country , and only an absent-minded one who leaves his stick and not his visiting-card after waiting an hour in your room . `` `` And the dog ? `` `` Has been in the habit of carrying this stick behind his master . Being a heavy stick the dog has held it tightly by the middle , and the marks of his teeth are very plainly visible . The dog 's jaw , as shown in the space between these marks , is too broad in my opinion for a terrier and not broad enough for a mastiff . It may have been -- -yes , by Jove , it is a curly-haired spaniel . `` He had risen and paced the room as he spoke . Now he halted in the recess of the window . There was such a ring of conviction in his voice that I glanced up in surprise . `` My dear fellow , how can you possibly be so sure of that ? `` `` For the very simple reason that I see the dog himself on our very door-step , and there is the ring of its owner . Do n't move , I beg you , Watson . He is a professional brother of yours , and your presence may be of assistance to me . Now is the dramatic moment of fate , Watson , when you hear a step upon the stair which is walking into your life , and you know not whether for good or ill. What does Dr. James Mortimer , the man of science , ask of Sherlock Holmes , the specialist in crime ? Come in ! `` The appearance of our visitor was a surprise to me , since I had expected a typical country practitioner . He was a very tall , thin man , with a long nose like a beak , which jutted out between two keen , gray eyes , set closely together and sparkling brightly from behind a pair of gold-rimmed glasses . He was clad in a professional but rather slovenly fashion , for his frock-coat was dingy and his trousers frayed . Though young , his long back was already bowed , and he walked with a forward thrust of his head and a general air of peering benevolence . As he
