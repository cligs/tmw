an old servant of mine , Mrs. Jorrocks , chanced to reside in the neighbourhood , I have warned her that at any time I might come down and should expect to find things ready . Your rash and heartless conduct has , however , precipitated matters , and we have arrived before her preparations were complete . Our future arrangements will therefore be less primitive than they are at present . Here you shall remain , young lady , until you show signs of repentance , and of a willingness to undo the harm which you have done . `` `` If you mean until I consent to marry your son , then I shall live and die here , '' the girl said bravely . `` That rests with yourself . As I said before , you are under discipline here , and you may not find existence such a bed of roses as it was in Eccleston Square . `` `` Can I have my maid ? '' Kate asked . `` I can hardly stay here with no one but the old woman in the house . `` `` Rebecca is coming down . I had a telegram from Ezra to that effect , and he will himself join us for a day or two in each week . `` `` Ezra here ! '' Kate cried in horror . Her chief consolation through all her troubles had been that there seemed to be some chance of getting rid of her terrible suitor . `` And why not ? '' the old man asked angrily . `` Are you so bitter against the lad as to grudge him the society of his own father ? `` Kate was saved from further reproaches by the entrance of the old woman to clear the table . The last item of intelligence , however , had given her a terrible shock , and at the same time had filled her with astonishment . What could the fast-living , comfort-seeking man about town want in this dreary abode ? She knew Ezra well , and was sure that he was not a man to alter his ways of life or suffer discomfort of any kind without some very definite object . It seemed to her that this was a new mesh in the net which was being drawn round her.When her guardian had left the room Kate asked Mrs. Jorrocks for a sheet of paper . The crone shook her head and wagged her pendulous lip in derision . `` Mister Girdlestone thought as you would be after that , '' she said . `` There ai n't no paper here , nor pens neither , nor ink neither . `` `` What , none ! Dear Mrs. Jorrocks , do have pity on me , and get me a sheet , however old and soiled . See , here is some silver ! You are very welcome to it if you will give me the materials for writing one letter. '' Mrs . Jorrocks looked longingly with her bleared eyes at the few shillings which the girl held out to her , but she shook her head . `` I durs n't do it , '' she said . `` It 's as much as my place is worth . `` `` Then I shall walk down to Bedsworth myself , '' said Kate angrily . `` I have no doubt that the people in the post office will let me sit there and write it . `` The old hag laughed hoarsely to herself until the scraggy sinews of her withered neck stood out like whipcord . She was still chuckling and coughing when the merchant came back into the room . `` What then ? '' he asked sternly , looking from one to the other . He was himself constitutionally averse to merriment , and he was irritated by it in others . `` Why are you laughing , Mrs . Jorrocks ? `` `` I was a-laughing at her , '' the woman wheezed , pointing with tremulous fingers . `` She was askin ' me for paper , and sayin ' as she would go and write a letter at the Bedsworth Post Office . `` `` You must understand once for all , '' Girdlestone roared , turning savagely upon the girl , `` that you are cut off entirely from the outer world . I shall give you no loophole which you may utilize to continue your intimacy with undesirable people . I have given orders that you should not be provided with either paper or ink . `` Poor Kate 's last hope seemed to be fading away . Her heart sank within her , but she kept a brave face , for she did not wish him to see how his words had stricken her . She had a desperate plan in her head , which would be more likely to be successful could she but put him off his guard.She spent the morning in her own little room . She had been provided with a ponderous brown Bible , out of which the fly leaves had been carefully cut , and this she read , though her thoughts often wandered away from the sacred pages . About one o'clock she heard the clatter of hoofs and the sound of wheels on the drive . Going down , she found that it was a cart which had come from Bedsworth with furniture . There were carpets , a chest of drawers , tables , and several other articles , which the driver proceeded to carry upstairs , helped by John Girdlestone . The old woman was in the upper room . It seemed to Kate that she might never again have such an opportunity of carrying out the resolve which she had formed . She put on her bonnet , and began to stroll listlessly about in front of the door , picking a few straggling leaves from the neglected lawn . Gradually she sauntered away in this manner to the head of the avenue , and then , taking one swift timid glance around , she slipped in among the trees , and made the best of her way , half walking , half running , down the dark winding drive.Oh , the joy of the moment when the great white house which had already become so hateful to her was obscured among the trees behind her ! She had some idea of the road which she had traversed the night before . Behind her were all her troubles . In front the avenue gate , Bedsworth , and freedom . She would send both a telegram and a letter to Dr. Dimsdale , and explain to him her exact situation . If the kind-hearted and energetic physician once knew of it , he would take care that no harm befell her . She could return then , and face with a light heart the worst which her guardian could do to her . Here was the avenue entrance now , the high lichen-eaten stone pillars , with the battered device upon the top . The iron gate between was open . With a glad cry she quickened her pace , and in another moment would have been in the high-road , when -- - '' Now then , where are you a-comin ' to ? '' cried a gruff voice from among the bushes which flanked the gate.The girl stopped , all in a tremble . In the shadow of the trees there was a camp-stool , and on the camp-stool sat a savage-looking man , dressed in a dark corduroy suit , with a blackened clay pipe stuck in the corner of his mouth . His weather-beaten mahogany face was plentifully covered with small-pox marks , and one of his eyes was sightless and white from the effects of the same disease . He rose now , and interposed himself between her and the gate . `` Sink me , if it ai n't her , '' he said slowly , surveying her from head to foot . `` I were given to understand that she was a spanker , an ' a spanker she be . '' With this oracular remark he took a step back and surveyed Kate again with his one eye . `` My good man , '' she said , in a trembling voice , for his appearance was far from reassuring , `` I wish to go past and to get to Bedsworth . Here is a shilling , and I beg that you will not detain me . `` Her companion stretched out a very dirty hand , took the coin , spun it up in the air , caught it , bit it , and finally plunged it into the depths of his trouser pockets . `` No road this way , missy , '' he said ; `` I 've given my word to the guv'nor , and I ca n't go back from it . `` `` You have no right to detain me , '' Kate cried angrily . `` I have good friends in London who will make you suffer for this . `` `` She 's a-goin ' to flare up , '' said the one-eyed man ; `` knock me helpless , if she ai n't ! `` `` I shall come through ! '' the girl cried in desperation . She was only a dozen yards from the lane which led to freedom , so she made a quick little feminine rush in the hope of avoiding this dreadful sentinel who barred her passage . He caught her round the waist , however , and hurled her back with such violence that she staggered across the path , and would have fallen had she not struck violently against a tree . As it was , she was badly bruised and the breath shaken out of her body . `` Shehasflared up , '' said the one-eyed man , removing his pipe from his lips . `` Blow me asunder if she bea n't a rustler ! '' He brought his camp-stool from the side of the pillar and , planting it right in the centre of the gateway , sat down upon it again . `` You see , missy , '' he remarked , `` it 's no manner o ' use . If you did get out it would only be to be put in a reg'lar 'sylum . `` `` An asylum ! '' gasped Kate , sobbing with pain and anger . `` Do you think I am mad , then ? `` `` I do n't think nowt about it , '' the man remarked calmly . `` I knows it . `` This was a new light to Kate . She was so bewildered that she could hardly realize the significance of the remark . `` Who are you ? '' she said . `` Why is it that you treat me in this cruel way ? `` `` Ah , now we come to business , '' he said , in a satisfied way , crossing his legs , and blowing great wreaths from his pipe . `` This is more like reason . Who am I ? says you . Well , my name 's Stevens -- -Bill Stevens , hesquire , o ' Claxton , in the county o ' Hants . I 've been an A.B . in the navy , and I 've got my pension to show it . I 've been in the loon'cy business , too -- -was second warder in the suicide ward at Portsmouth for more'n two year . I 've been out of a billet
