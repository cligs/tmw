poor men that are trying in our own way to get our rights . `` Ettie threw her arms round her lover 's neck . `` Give it up , Jack ! For my sake , for God 's sake , give it up ! It was to ask you that I came here to-day . Oh , Jack , see -- -I beg it of you on my bended knees ! Kneeling here before you I implore you to give it up ! `` He raised her and soothed her with her head against his breast . `` Sure , my darlin ' , you do n't know what it is you are asking . How could I give it up when it would be to break my oath and to desert my comrades ? If you could see how things stand with me you could never ask it of me . Besides , if I wanted to , how could I do it ? You do n't suppose that the lodge would let a man go free with all its secrets ? `` `` I 've thought of that , Jack . I 've planned it all . Father has saved some money . He is weary of this place where the fear of these people darkens our lives . He is ready to go . We would fly together to Philadelphia or New York , where we would be safe from them . `` McMurdo laughed . `` The lodge has a long arm . Do you think it could not stretch from here to Philadelphia or New York ? `` `` Well , then , to the West , or to England , or to Germany , where father came from -- -anywhere to get away from this Valley of Fear ! `` McMurdo thought of old Brother Morris . `` Sure , it is the second time I have heard the valley so named , '' said he . `` The shadow does indeed seem to lie heavy on some of you . `` `` It darkens every moment of our lives . Do you suppose that Ted Baldwin has ever forgiven us ? If it were not that he fears you , what do you suppose our chances would be ? If you saw the look in those dark , hungry eyes of his when they fall on me ! `` `` By Gar ! I 'd teach him better manners if I caught him at it ! But see here , little girl . I ca n't leave here . I ca n't -- -take that from me once and for all . But if you will leave me to find my own way , I will try to prepare a way of getting honourably out of it . `` `` There is no honour in such a matter . `` `` Well , well , it 's just how you look at it . But if you 'll give me six months , I 'll work it so that I can leave without being ashamed to look others in the face . `` The girl laughed with joy . `` Six months ! '' she cried . `` Is it a promise ? `` `` Well , it may be seven or eight . But within a year at the furthest we will leave the valley behind us . `` It was the most that Ettie could obtain , and yet it was something . There was this distant light to illuminate the gloom of the immediate future . She returned to her father 's house more light-hearted than she had ever been since Jack McMurdo had come into her life.It might be thought that as a member , all the doings of the society would be told to him ; but he was soon to discover that the organization was wider and more complex than the simple lodge . Even Boss McGinty was ignorant as to many things ; for there was an official named the County Delegate , living at Hobson 's Patch farther down the line , who had power over several different lodges which he wielded in a sudden and arbitrary way . Only once did McMurdo see him , a sly , little gray-haired rat of a man , with a slinking gait and a sidelong glance which was charged with malice . Evans Pott was his name , and even the great Boss of Vermissa felt towards him something of the repulsion and fear which the huge Danton may have felt for the puny but dangerous Robespierre.One day Scanlan , who was McMurdo 's fellow boarder , received a note from McGinty inclosing one from Evans Pott , which informed him that he was sending over two good men , Lawler and Andrews , who had instructions to act in the neighbourhood ; though it was best for the cause that no particulars as to their objects should be given . Would the Bodymaster see to it that suitable arrangements be made for their lodgings and comfort until the time for action should arrive ? McGinty added that it was impossible for anyone to remain secret at the Union House , and that , therefore , he would be obliged if McMurdo and Scanlan would put the strangers up for a few days in their boarding house.The same evening the two men arrived , each carrying his gripsack . Lawler was an elderly man , shrewd , silent , and self-contained , clad in an old black frock coat , which with his soft felt hat and ragged , grizzled beard gave him a general resemblance to an itinerant preacher . His companion Andrews was little more than a boy , frank-faced and cheerful , with the breezy manner of one who is out for a holiday and means to enjoy every minute of it . Both men were total abstainers , and behaved in all ways as exemplary members of the society , with the one simple exception that they were assassins who had often proved themselves to be most capable instruments for this association of murder . Lawler had already carried out fourteen commissions of the kind , and Andrews three.They were , as McMurdo found , quite ready to converse about their deeds in the past , which they recounted with the half-bashful pride of men who had done good and unselfish service for the community . They were reticent , however , as to the immediate job in hand . `` They chose us because neither I nor the boy here drink , '' Lawler explained . `` They can count on us saying no more than we should . You must not take it amiss , but it is the orders of the County Delegate that we obey . `` `` Sure , we are all in it together , '' said Scanlan , McMurdo 's mate , as the four sat together at supper . `` That 's true enough , and we 'll talk till the cows come home of the killing of Charlie Williams or of Simon Bird , or any other job in the past . But till the work is done we say nothing . `` `` There are half a dozen about here that I have a word to say to , '' said McMurdo , with an oath . `` I suppose it is n't Jack Knox of Ironhill that you are after . I 'd go some way to see him get his deserts . `` `` No , it 's not him yet . `` `` Or Herman Strauss ? `` `` No , nor him either . `` `` Well , if you wo n't tell us we ca n't make you ; but I 'd be glad to know . `` Lawler smiled and shook his head . He was not to be drawn.In spite of the reticence of their guests , Scanlan and McMurdo were quite determined to be present at what they called `` the fun . '' When , therefore , at an early hour one morning McMurdo heard them creeping down the stairs he awakened Scanlan , and the two hurried on their clothes . When they were dressed they found that the others had stolen out , leaving the door open behind them . It was not yet dawn , and by the light of the lamps they could see the two men some distance down the street . They followed them warily , treading noiselessly in the deep snow.The boarding house was near the edge of the town , and soon they were at the crossroads which is beyond its boundary . Here three men were waiting , with whom Lawler and Andrews held a short , eager conversation . Then they all moved on together . It was clearly some notable job which needed numbers . At this point there are several trails which lead to various mines . The strangers took that which led to the Crow Hill , a huge business which was in strong hands which had been able , thanks to their energetic and fearless New England manager , Josiah H. Dunn , to keep some order and discipline during the long reign of terror.Day was breaking now , and a line of workmen were slowly making their way , singly and in groups , along the blackened path.McMurdo and Scanlan strolled on with the others , keeping in sight of the men whom they followed . A thick mist lay over them , and from the heart of it there came the sudden scream of a steam whistle . It was the ten-minute signal before the cages descended and the day 's labour began.When they reached the open space round the mine shaft there were a hundred miners waiting , stamping their feet and blowing on their fingers ; for it was bitterly cold . The strangers stood in a little group under the shadow of the engine house . Scanlan and McMurdo climbed a heap of slag from which the whole scene lay before them . They saw the mine engineer , a great bearded Scotchman named Menzies , come out of the engine house and blow his whistle for the cages to be lowered.At the same instant a tall , loose-framed young man with a clean-shaved , earnest face advanced eagerly towards the pit head . As he came forward his eyes fell upon the group , silent and motionless , under the engine house . The men had drawn down their hats and turned up their collars to screen their faces . For a moment the presentiment of Death laid its cold hand upon the manager 's heart . At the next he had shaken it off and saw only his duty towards intrusive strangers . `` Who are you ? '' he asked as he advanced . `` What are you loitering there for ? `` There was no answer ; but the lad Andrews stepped forward and shot him in the stomach . The hundred waiting miners stood as motionless and helpless as if they were paralyzed . The manager clapped his two hands to the wound and doubled himself up . Then he staggered away ; but another of the assassins fired , and he went down sidewise , kicking and clawing among a heap of clinkers . Menzies , the Scotchman , gave a roar of rage at the sight and rushed with an iron spanner at the murderers ; but was met by two balls in the face which dropped him dead at their very feet.There was a surge forward of some of the miners , and an inarticulate cry of pity and of anger ; but a couple of
