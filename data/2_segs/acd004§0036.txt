'' said Sir Nigel , `` it would be a very strange thing if any ship were not a war-ship when it had such men as these upon her decks . Certes , we shall do as I say , and that no later than this very day . `` `` My lord , '' said a rough-haired , dark-faced man , who walked by the knight 's other stirrup , with his head sloped to catch all that he was saying . `` By your leave , I have no doubt that you are skilled in land fighting and the marshalling of lances , but , by my soul ! you will find it another thing upon the sea . I am the master-shipman of this yellow cog , and my name is Goodwin Hawtayne . I have sailed since I was as high as this staff , and I have fought against these Normans and against the Genoese , as well as the Scotch , the Bretons , the Spanish , and the Moors . I tell you , sir , that my ship is over light and over frail for such work , and it will but end in our having our throats cut , or being sold as slaves to the Barbary heathen . `` `` I also have experienced one or two gentle and honorable ventures upon the sea , '' quoth Sir Nigel , `` and I am right blithe to have so fair a task before us . I think , good master-shipman , that you and I may win great honor in this matter , and I can see very readily that you are a brave and stout man . `` `` I like it not , '' said the other sturdily . `` In God 's name , I like it not . And yet Goodwin Hawtayne is not the man to stand back when his fellows are for pressing forward . By my soul ! be it sink or swim , I shall turn her beak into Freshwater Bay , and if good Master Witherton , of Southampton , like not my handling of his ship then he may find another master-shipman . `` They were close by the old north gate of the little town , and Alleyne , half turning in his saddle , looked back at the motley crowd who followed . The bowmen and men-at-arms had broken their ranks and were intermingled with the fishermen and citizens , whose laughing faces and hearty gestures bespoke the weight of care from which this welcome arrival had relieved them . Here and there among the moving throng of dark jerkins and of white surcoats were scattered dashes of scarlet and blue , the whimples or shawls of the women . Aylward , with a fishing lass on either arm , was vowing constancy alternately to her on the right and her on the left , while big John towered in the rear with a little chubby maiden enthroned upon his great shoulder , her soft white arm curled round his shining headpiece . So the throng moved on , until at the very gate it was brought to a stand by a wondrously fat man , who came darting forth from the town with rage in every feature of his rubicund face . `` How now , Sir Mayor ? '' he roared , in a voice like a bull . `` How now , Sir Mayor ? How of the clams and the scallops ? `` `` By Our Lady ! my sweet Sir Oliver , '' cried the mayor . `` I have had so much to think of , with these wicked villains so close upon us , that it had quite gone out of my head . `` `` Words , words ! '' shouted the other furiously . `` Am I to be put off with words ? I say to you again , how of the clams and scallops ? `` `` My fair sir , you flatter me , '' cried the mayor . `` I am a peaceful trader , and I am not wont to be so shouted at upon so small a matter. '' '' Small ! '' shrieked the other . `` Small ! Clams and scallops ! Ask me to your table to partake of the dainty of the town , and when I come a barren welcome and a bare board ! Where is my spear-bearer ? `` `` Nay , Sir Oliver , Sir Oliver ! '' cried Sir Nigel , laughing . `` Let your anger be appeased , since instead of this dish you come upon an old friend and comrade . `` `` By St. Martin of Tours ! '' shouted the fat knight , his wrath all changed in an instant to joy , `` if it is not my dear little game rooster of the Garonne . Ah , my sweet coz , I am right glad to see you . What days we have seen together ! `` `` Aye , by my faith , '' cried Sir Nigel , with sparkling eyes , `` we have seen some valiant men , and we have shown our pennons in some noble skirmishes . By St. Paul ! we have had great joys in France . `` `` And sorrows also , '' quoth the other . `` I have some sad memories of the land . Can you recall that which befell us at Libourne ? `` `` Nay , I can not call to mind that we ever so much as drew sword at the place . `` `` Man , man , '' cried Sir Oliver , `` your mind still runs on nought but blades and bassinets . Hast no space in thy frame for the softer joys . Ah , even now I can scarce speak of it unmoved . So noble a pie , such tender pigeons , and sugar in the gravy instead of salt ! You were by my side that day , as were Sir Claude Latour and the Lord of Pommers . `` `` I remember it , '' said Sir Nigel , laughing , `` and how you harried the cook down the street , and spoke of setting fire to the inn . By St. Paul ! most worthy mayor , my old friend is a perilous man , and I rede you that you compose your difference with him on such terms as you may . `` `` The clams and scallops shall be ready within the hour , '' the mayor answered . `` I had asked Sir Oliver Buttesthorn to do my humble board the honor to partake at it of the dainty upon which we take some little pride , but in sooth this alarm of pirates hath cast such a shadow on my wits that I am like one distrait . But I trust , Sir Nigel , that you will also partake of none-meat with me ? `` `` I have overmuch to do , '' Sir Nigel answered , `` for we must be aboard , horse and man , as early as we may . How many do you muster , Sir Oliver ? `` `` Three and forty . The forty are drunk , and the three are but indifferent sober . I have them all safe upon the ship . `` `` They had best find their wits again , for I shall have work for every man of them ere the sun set . It is my intention , if it seems good to you , to try a venture against these Norman and Genoese rovers . `` `` They carry caviare and certain very noble spices from the Levant aboard of ships from Genoa , '' quoth Sir Oliver . `` We may come to great profit through the business . I pray you , master-shipman , that when you go on board you pour a helmetful of sea-water over any of my rogues whom you may see there . `` Leaving the lusty knight and the Mayor of Lepe , Sir Nigel led the Company straight down to the water 's edge , where long lines of flat lighters swiftly bore them to their vessel . Horse after horse was slung by main force up from the barges , and after kicking and plunging in empty air was dropped into the deep waist of the yellow cog , where rows of stalls stood ready for their safe keeping . Englishmen in those days were skilled and prompt in such matters , for it was so not long before that Edward had embarked as many as fifty thousand men in the port of Orwell , with their horses and their baggage , all in the space of four-and-twenty hours . So urgent was Sir Nigel on the shore , and so prompt was Goodwin Hawtayne on the cog , that Sir Oliver Buttesthorn had scarce swallowed his last scallop ere the peal of the trumpet and clang of nakir announced that all was ready and the anchor drawn . In the last boat which left the shore the two commanders sat together in the sheets , a strange contrast to one another , while under the feet of the rowers was a litter of huge stones which Sir Nigel had ordered to be carried to the cog . These once aboard , the ship set her broad mainsail , purple in color , and with a golden St. Christopher bearing Christ upon his shoulder in the centre of it . The breeze blew , the sail bellied , over heeled the portly vessel , and away she plunged through the smooth blue rollers , amid the clang of the minstrels on her poop and the shouting of the black crowd who fringed the yellow beach . To the left lay the green Island of Wight , with its long , low , curving hills peeping over each other 's shoulders to the sky-line ; to the right the wooded Hampshire coast as far as eye could reach ; above a steel-blue heaven , with a wintry sun shimmering down upon them , and enough of frost to set the breath a-smoking . `` By St . Paul ! '' said Sir Nigel gayly , as he stood upon the poop and looked on either side of him , `` it is a land which is very well worth fighting for , and it were pity to go to France for what may be had at home . Did you not spy a crooked man upon the beach ? `` `` Nay , I spied nothing , '' grumbled Sir Oliver , `` for I was hurried down with a clam stuck in my gizzard and an untasted goblet of Cyprus on the board behind me . `` `` I saw him , my fair lord , '' said Terlake , `` an old man with one shoulder higher than the other . `` `` 'T is a sign of good fortune , '' quoth Sir Nigel . `` Our path was also crossed by a woman and by a priest , so all should be well with us . What say you , Edricson ? `` `` I can not tell , my fair lord . The Romans of old were a very wise people , yet , certes , they placed their faith in such matters . So , too , did the Greeks , and divers other ancient peoples who were famed for their learning . Yet of the moderns there are many who scoff at all omens . `` `` There can be no manner of doubt about it , '' said
