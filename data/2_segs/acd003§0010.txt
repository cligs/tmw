mystery . The Indian treasure , the curious plan found among Morstan 's baggage , the strange scene at Major Sholto 's death , the rediscovery of the treasure immediately followed by the murder of the discoverer , the very singular accompaniments to the crime , the footsteps , the remarkable weapons , the words upon the card , corresponding with those upon Captain Morstan 's chart , -- -here was indeed a labyrinth in which a man less singularly endowed than my fellow-lodger might well despair of ever finding the clue.Pinchin Lane was a row of shabby two-storied brick houses in the lower quarter of Lambeth . I had to knock for some time at No . 3 before I could make my impression . At last , however , there was the glint of a candle behind the blind , and a face looked out at the upper window . `` Go on , you drunken vagabone , '' said the face . `` If you kick up any more row I 'll open the kennels and let out forty-three dogs upon you . `` `` If you 'll let one out it 's just what I have come for , '' said I . `` Go on ! '' yelled the voice . `` So help me gracious , I have a wiper in the bag , an ' I 'll drop it on your 'ead if you do n't hook it . `` `` But I want a dog , '' I cried . `` I wo n't be argued with ! '' shouted Mr. Sherman . `` Now stand clear , for when I say 'three , ' down goes the wiper. '' '' Mr . Sherlock Holmes -- - '' I began , but the words had a most magical effect , for the window instantly slammed down , and within a minute the door was unbarred and open . Mr. Sherman was a lanky , lean old man , with stooping shoulders , a stringy neck , and blue-tinted glasses . `` A friend of Mr. Sherlock is always welcome , '' said he . `` Step in , sir . Keep clear of the badger ; for he bites . Ah , naughty , naughty , would you take a nip at the gentleman ? '' This to a stoat which thrust its wicked head and red eyes between the bars of its cage . `` Do n't mind that , sir : it 's only a slow-worm . It hai n't got no fangs , so I gives it the run o ' the room , for it keeps the beetles down . You must not mind my bein ' just a little short wi ' you at first , for I 'm guyed at by the children , and there 's many a one just comes down this lane to knock me up . What was it that Mr. Sherlock Holmes wanted , sir ? `` `` He wanted a dog of yours. '' '' Ah ! that would be Toby . `` `` Yes , Toby was the name . `` `` Toby lives at No . 7 on the left here . '' He moved slowly forward with his candle among the queer animal family which he had gathered round him . In the uncertain , shadowy light I could see dimly that there were glancing , glimmering eyes peeping down at us from every cranny and corner . Even the rafters above our heads were lined by solemn fowls , who lazily shifted their weight from one leg to the other as our voices disturbed their slumbers.Toby proved to be an ugly , long-haired , lop-eared creature , half spaniel and half lurcher , brown-and-white in color , with a very clumsy waddling gait . It accepted after some hesitation a lump of sugar which the old naturalist handed to me , and , having thus sealed an alliance , it followed me to the cab , and made no difficulties about accompanying me . It had just struck three on the Palace clock when I found myself back once more at Pondicherry Lodge . The ex-prize-fighter McMurdo had , I found , been arrested as an accessory , and both he and Mr. Sholto had been marched off to the station . Two constables guarded the narrow gate , but they allowed me to pass with the dog on my mentioning the detective 's name.Holmes was standing on the door-step , with his hands in his pockets , smoking his pipe . `` Ah , you have him there ! '' said he . `` Good dog , then ! Atheney Jones has gone . We have had an immense display of energy since you left . He has arrested not only friend Thaddeus , but the gatekeeper , the housekeeper , and the Indian servant . We have the place to ourselves , but for a sergeant up-stairs . Leave the dog here , and come up . `` We tied Toby to the hall table , and reascended the stairs . The room was as he had left it , save that a sheet had been draped over the central figure . A weary-looking police-sergeant reclined in the corner . `` Lend me your bull's-eye , sergeant , '' said my companion . `` Now tie this bit of card round my neck , so as to hang it in front of me . Thank you . Now I must kick off my boots and stockings. -- -Just you carry them down with you , Watson . I am going to do a little climbing . And dip my handkerchief into the creasote . That will do . Now come up into the garret with me for a moment . `` We clambered up through the hole . Holmes turned his light once more upon the footsteps in the dust . `` I wish you particularly to notice these footmarks , '' he said . `` Do you observe anything noteworthy about them ? `` `` They belong , '' I said , `` to a child or a small woman . `` `` Apart from their size , though . Is there nothing else ? `` `` They appear to be much as other footmarks . `` `` Not at all . Look here ! This is the print of a right foot in the dust . Now I make one with my naked foot beside it . What is the chief difference ? `` `` Your toes are all cramped together . The other print has each toe distinctly divided . `` `` Quite so . That is the point . Bear that in mind . Now , would you kindly step over to that flap-window and smell the edge of the wood-work ? I shall stay here , as I have this handkerchief in my hand . `` I did as he directed , and was instantly conscious of a strong tarry smell . `` That is where he put his foot in getting out . If YOU can trace him , I should think that Toby will have no difficulty . Now run down-stairs , loose the dog , and look out for Blondin . `` By the time that I got out into the grounds Sherlock Holmes was on the roof , and I could see him like an enormous glow-worm crawling very slowly along the ridge . I lost sight of him behind a stack of chimneys , but he presently reappeared , and then vanished once more upon the opposite side . When I made my way round there I found him seated at one of the corner eaves . `` That you , Watson ? '' he cried. '' Yes . `` `` This is the place . What is that black thing down there ? `` `` A water-barrel . `` `` Top on it ? '' '' Yes . `` `` No sign of a ladder ? '' '' No . `` `` Confound the fellow ! It 's a most break-neck place . I ought to be able to come down where he could climb up . The water-pipe feels pretty firm . Here goes , anyhow . `` There was a scuffling of feet , and the lantern began to come steadily down the side of the wall . Then with a light spring he came on to the barrel , and from there to the earth . `` It was easy to follow him , '' he said , drawing on his stockings and boots . `` Tiles were loosened the whole way along , and in his hurry he had dropped this . It confirms my diagnosis , as you doctors express it . `` The object which he held up to me was a small pocket or pouch woven out of colored grasses and with a few tawdry beads strung round it . In shape and size it was not unlike a cigarette-case . Inside were half a dozen spines of dark wood , sharp at one end and rounded at the other , like that which had struck Bartholomew Sholto . `` They are hellish things , '' said he . `` Look out that you do n't prick yourself . I 'm delighted to have them , for the chances are that they are all he has . There is the less fear of you or me finding one in our skin before long . I would sooner face a Martini bullet , myself . Are you game for a six-mile trudge , Watson ? `` `` Certainly , '' I answered . `` Your leg will stand it ? `` `` Oh , yes . `` `` Here you are , doggy ! Good old Toby ! Smell it , Toby , smell it ! '' He pushed the creasote handkerchief under the dog 's nose , while the creature stood with its fluffy legs separated , and with a most comical cock to its head , like a connoisseur sniffing the bouquet of a famous vintage . Holmes then threw the handkerchief to a distance , fastened a stout cord to the mongrel 's collar , and led him to the foot of the water-barrel . The creature instantly broke into a succession of high , tremulous yelps , and , with his nose on the ground , and his tail in the air , pattered off upon the trail at a pace which strained his leash and kept us at the top of our speed.The east had been gradually whitening , and we could now see some distance in the cold gray light . The square , massive house , with its black , empty windows and high , bare walls , towered up , sad and forlorn , behind us . Our course led right across the grounds , in and out among the trenches and pits with which they were scarred and intersected . The whole place , with its scattered dirt-heaps and ill-grown shrubs , had a blighted , ill-omened look which harmonized with the black tragedy which hung over it.On reaching the boundary wall Toby ran along , whining eagerly , underneath its shadow , and stopped finally in a corner screened by a young beech . Where the two walls joined , several bricks had been loosened , and the crevices left were worn down and rounded upon the lower side , as though they had frequently been used as a ladder . Holmes clambered up , and , taking the dog from me , he dropped it over upon the other side . `` There 's the print of wooden-leg 's hand , '' he remarked , as
