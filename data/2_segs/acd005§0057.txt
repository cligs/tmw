straight up against the red evening sky . `` I do n't like them , '' said he . `` They are Iroquois then ? '' '' Yes . `` `` Well , at least it proves that they are on the other side of the river . `` `` It proves that they are on this side. '' '' What ! `` Du Lhut lit his pipe from a tinder paper . `` The Iroquois are on this side , '' said he . `` They crossed to the south of us . `` `` And you never told us . How do you know that they crossed , and why did you not tell us ? `` `` I did not know until I saw the fires over yonder . `` `` And how did they tell you ? `` `` Tut , an Indian papoose could have told , '' said Du Lhut impatiently . `` Iroquois on the trail do nothing without an object . They have an object then in showing that smoke . If their war-parties were over yonder there would be no object . Therefore their braves must have crossed the river . And they could not get over to the north without being seen from the fort . They have got over on the south then . `` Amos nodded with intense appreciation . `` That 's it ! '' said he , `` that'sInjun ways . I 'll lay that he is right . `` `` Then they may be in the woods round us . We may be in danger , '' cried De la Noue.Du Lhut nodded and sucked at his pipe.De Catinat cast a glance round him at the grand tree trunks , the fading foliage , the smooth sward underneath with the long evening shadows barred across it . How difficult it was to realise that behind all this beauty there lurked a danger so deadly and horrible that a man alone might well shrink from it , far less one who had the woman whom he loved walking within hand 's touch of him . It was with a long heart-felt sigh of relief that he saw a wall of stockade in the midst of a large clearing in front of him , with the stone manor house rising above it . In a line from the stockade were a dozen cottages with cedar-shingled roofs turned up in the Norman fashion , in which dwelt the habitants under the protection of the seigneur 's chateau -- -a strange little graft of the feudal system in the heart of an American forest . Above the main gate as they approached was a huge shield of wood with a coat of arms painted upon it , a silver ground with a chevron ermine between three coronets gules . At either corner a small brass cannon peeped through an embrasure . As they passed the gate the guard inside closed it and placed the huge wooden bars into position . A little crowd of men , women , and children were gathered round the door of the chateau , and a man appeared to be seated on a high-backed chair upon the threshold . `` You know my father , '' said the young man with a shrug of his shoulders . `` He will have it that he has never left his Norman castle , and that he is still the Seigneur de la Noue , the greatest man within a day 's ride of Rouen , and of the richest blood of Normandy . He is now taking his dues and his yearly oaths from his tenants , and he would not think it becoming , if the governor himself were to visit him , to pause in the middle of so august a ceremony . But if it would interest you , you may step this way and wait until he has finished . You , madame , I will take at once to my mother , if you will be so kind as to follow me . `` The sight was , to the Americans at least , a novel one . A triple row of men , women , and children were standing round in a semicircle , the men rough and sunburned , the women homely and clean , with white caps upon their heads , the children open-mouthed and round-eyed , awed into an unusual quiet by the reverent bearing of their elders . In the centre , on his high-backed carved chair , there sat an elderly man very stiff and erect , with an exceedingly solemn face . He was a fine figure of a man , tall and broad , with large strong features , clean-shaven and deeply-lined , a huge beak of a nose , and strong shaggy eyebrows which arched right up to the great wig , which he wore full and long as it had been worn in France in his youth . On his wig was placed a white hat cocked jauntily at one side with a red feather streaming round it , and he wore a coat of cinnamon-coloured cloth with silver at the neck and pockets , which was still very handsome , though it bore signs of having been frayed and mended more than once . This , with black velvet knee-breeches and high well-polished boots , made a costume such as De Catinat had never before seen in the wilds of Canada.As they watched , a rude husbandman walked forwards from the crowd , and kneeling down upon a square of carpet placed his hands between those of the seigneur . `` Monsieur de Sainte Marie , Monsieur de Sainte Marie , Monsieur de Sainte Marie , '' said he three times , `` I bring you the faith and homage which I am bound to bring you on account of my fief Herbert , which I hold as a man of faith of your seigneury . `` `` Be true , my son . Be valiant and true ! '' said the old nobleman solemnly , and then with a sudden change of tone : `` What in the name of the devil has your daughter got there ? `` A girl had advanced from the crowd with a large strip of bark in front of her on which was heaped a pile of dead fish . `` It is your eleventh fish which I am bound by my oath to render to you , '' said thecensitaire . `` There are seventy-three in the heap , and I have caught eight hundred in the month . '' '' Peste ! `` cried the nobleman . `` Do you think , Andre Dubois , that I will disorder my health by eating three-and-seventy fish in this fashion ? Do you think that I and my body-servants and my personal retainers and the other members of my household have nothing to do but to eat your fish ? In future , you will pay your tribute not more than five at a time . Where is the major-domo ? Theuriet , remove the fish to our central store-house , and be careful that the smell does not penetrate to the blue tapestry chamber or to my lady 's suite . `` A man in very shabby black livery , all stained and faded , advanced with a large tin platter and carried off the pile of white fish . Then , as each of the tenants stepped forward to pay their old-world homage , they all left some share of their industry for their lord 's maintenance . With some it was a bundle of wheat , with some a barrel of potatoes , while others had brought skins of deer or of beaver . All these were carried off by the major-domo , until each had paid his tribute , and the singular ceremony was brought to a conclusion . As the seigneur rose , his son , who had returned , took De Catinat by the sleeve and led him through the throng . `` Father , '' said he , `` this is Monsieur de Catinat , whom you may remember some years ago at Quebec . `` The seigneur bowed with much condescension , and shook the guardsman by the hand . `` You are extremely welcome to my estates , both you and your body-servants -- - '' '' They are my friends , monsieur . This is Monsieur Amos Green and Captain Ephraim Savage . My wife is travelling with me , but your courteous son has kindly taken her to your lady . `` `` I am honoured -- -honoured indeed ! '' cried the old man , with a bow and a flourish . `` I remember you very well , sir , for it is not so common to meet men of quality in this country . I remember your father also , for he served with me at Rocroy , though he was in the Foot , and I in the Red Dragoons of Grissot . Your arms are a martlet in fess upon a field azure , and now that I think of it , the second daughter of your great-grand-father married the son of one of the La Noues of Andelys , which is one of our cadet branches . Kinsman , you are welcome ! '' He threw his arms suddenly round De Catinat and slapped him three times on the back.The young guardsman was only too delighted to find himself admitted to such an intimacy . `` I will not intrude long upon your hospitality , '' said he . `` We are journeying down to Lake Champlain , and we hope in a day or two to be ready to go on . `` `` A suite of rooms shall be laid at your disposal as long as you do me the honour to remain here.Peste ! It is not every day that I can open my gates to a man with good blood in his veins ! Ah , sir , that is what I feel most in my exile , for who is there with whom I can talk as equal to equal ? There is the governor , the intendant , perhaps , one or two priests , three or four officers , but how many of thenoblesse ? Scarcely one . They buy their titles over here as they buy their pelts , and it is better to have a canoe-load of beaver skins than a pedigree from Roland . But I forget my duties . You are weary and hungry , you and your friends . Come up with me to the tapestriedsalon , and we shall see if my stewards can find anything for your refreshment . You play piquet , if I remember right ? Ah , my skill is leaving me , and I should be glad to try a hand with you . `` The manor-house was high and strong , built of gray stone in a framework of wood . The large iron-clamped door through which they entered was pierced for musketry fire , and led into a succession of cellars and store-houses in which the beets , carrots , potatoes , cabbages , cured meat , dried eels , and other winter supplies were placed . A winding stone staircase led them through a huge kitchen , flagged and lofty , from which branched the rooms of the servants or retainers as the old nobleman preferred to call them . Above this again was the principal suite , centering in the dining-hall with its huge fireplace and rude home-made furniture . Rich rugs formed of bear or deer-skin were littered thickly over the brown-stained floor
