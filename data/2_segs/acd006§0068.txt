one night 's work our friend here goes to the colonies a prosperous man , and the firm of Girdlestone holds up its head once more , stainless and irreproachable . `` `` Speak low ! '' said Ezra , in a whisper . `` I hear her coming downstairs . `` They listened to her light springy footstep as it passed the door . `` Come here , Burt , '' he said , after a pause . `` She is at work on the lawn.Come and have a look at her . `` They all went over to the window , and looked out . It was then thatKate , glancing up , saw the three cruel faces surveying her . `` She 's a rare well-built 'un , '' said Burt , as he stepped back from the window . `` It is the ugliest job as ever I was on . `` `` But we can rely upon you ? '' Girdlestone asked , looking at him with puckered eyes . `` You bet -- -as long as you pay me , '' the navvy answered phlegmatically , and went back to his pipe and to Mrs. Jorrocks ' bottle of Hollands.The grey winter evening was beginning to steal in before the details had all been arranged by the conspirators . It had grown so chill that Kate had abandoned her attempt at gardening , and had gone back to her room . Ezra left his father and Burt by the fire and came out to the open hall-door . The grim old trees looked gaunt and eerie as they waved their naked arms about in the cutting wind . A slight fog had come up from the sea and lay in light wreaths over the upper branches , like a thin veil of gauze . Ezra was shivering as he surveyed the dreary scene , when he felt a hand on his arm , and looking round saw that the maid Rebecca was standing beside him . `` Have n't you got one word for me ? '' she said sadly , looking up into his face . `` It 's but once a week , and then never a word of greeting . `` `` I did n't see you , my lass , '' Ezra answered . `` How does the Priory suit you ? `` `` One place is the same as another to me , '' she said drearily . `` You asked me to come here , and I have come . You said once that you would let me know how I could serve you down here . When am I to know ? `` `` Why , there 's no secret about that . You do serve me when you look after my father as you have done these weeks back . That old woman is n't fit to manage the whole place by herself . `` `` That was n't what you meant , though , '' said the girl , looking at him with questioning eyes . `` I remember your face now as you spoke the words . You have something on your mind , and have now , only you keep it to yourself . Why wo n't you trust me with it ? `` `` Do n't be a fool ! '' answered Ezra curtly . `` I have a great deal to worry me in business matters . Much good it would do telling you about them ! `` `` It 's more than that , '' said Rebecca doggedly . `` Who is that man who has come down ? `` `` A business man from London . He has come to consult my father about money matters . Any more questions you would like to ask ? `` `` I should like to know how long we are to be kept down here , and what the meaning of it all may be . `` `` We are going back before the end of the winter , and the meaning of it is that Miss Harston was not well and needed a change of air . Now are you satisfied ? '' He was determined to allay as far as possible any suspicions that the girl might have previously formed . `` And what bringsyoudown here ? '' she asked , with the same searching look . `` You do n't come down into this hole without some good reason . I did think at first that you might come down in order to see me , but you soon showed me that it was n't that . There was a time when you was fond of me . `` `` So I am now , lass . `` `` Ay , very fond ! Not a word nor a look from you last time you came.You must have some reason , though , that brings you here . `` `` There 's nothing wonderful in a man coming to see his own father , '' '' Much you cared for him in London , '' she cried , with a shrill laugh . `` If he was under the sod you would not be the sadder . It 's my belief as you come down after that doll-faced missy upstairs . `` `` Dry up , now ! '' said Ezra roughly . `` I 've had enough of your confounded nonsense . `` `` You do n't talk in that style to her , '' she said excitedly . `` You scorn me , but I know this , that if I ca n't have your love no one else shall . I 've got a dash of the gipsy in me , as you know . Rather than that girl should have you , I would knife her and you , too ! '' She shook her clenched right hand as she spoke , and her face was so full of vindictive passion that Ezra was astonished . `` I always knew that you were a spitfire , '' he said , `` but you never came it quite so strong as this before . `` The reaction had already come upon her , however , and tears were running down her cheeks . `` You 'll never leave me entirely ? '' she cried , clasping his arm . `` I could bear to share your love with another , but I would n't have you turn altogether against me . `` `` You 'll have my father out presently with your damned noise ! '' said Ezra . `` Get away , and wash your face . `` His word was law to her , and she turned away , still weeping bitterly . In her poor , dim , eventless life the sole bright spot had been the attention which the young merchant had occasionally shown her . To her distorted fancy he was a man among men , a hero , all that was admirable and magnificent . What was there which she would not do for him ? She had the faithfulness of a dog , but like a dog she would snarl fiercely at any one who came between her master 's affection and herself . Deep down in her heart rankled the one suspicion which no assurances could remove , that an understanding existed between the man she loved and the woman she hated . As she withdrew to her room she determined that during this visit of Ezra 's she would manage in such a way that no communication could pass between them without her knowledge . She knew that it was a dangerous thing to play the spy upon the young man , for he had shown her before now that her sex was no precaution against his brutality . Nevertheless , she set herself to do it , with all the cunning and perseverance of a jealous woman.As the light faded and the greys of evening deepened into darkness , Kate sat patiently in her bare little room . A coal fire sputtered and sparkled in the rusty grate , and there was a tin bucket full of coals beside the fender from which to replenish it . She was very cold , so she drew her single chair up to the blaze and held her hands over it . It was a lonesome and melancholy vigil , while the wind whistled through the branches of the trees and moaned drearily in the cracks and crannies of the old house . When were her friends coming ? Perhaps something had occurred to detain them to-day . This morning such a thing would have appeared to her to be an impossibility , but now that the time had come when she had expected them , it appeared probable enough that something might have delayed them . To-morrow at latest they could not fail to come . She wondered what they would do if they did arrive . Would they come boldly up the avenue and claim her from the Girdlestones , or would they endeavour to communicate with her first ? Whatever they decided upon would be sure to be for the best.She went to the window once and looked out . It promised to be a wild night . Far away in the south-west lay a great cumulus of rugged clouds from which dark streamers radiated over the sky , like the advance guard of an army . Here and there a pale star twinkled dimly out through the rifts , but the greater part of the heavens was black and threatening . It was so dark that she could no longer see the sea , but the crashing , booming sound of the great waves filled the air and the salt spray came driving in through the open window . She shut it and resumed her seat by the fire , shivering partly from cold and partly from some vague presentiment of evil.An hour or more had passed when she heard a step upon the stairs and a knock came to her door . It was Rebecca , with a cup of tea upon a tray and some bread-and-butter . Kate was grateful at this attention , for it saved her from having to go down to the dining-room and face Ezra and his unpleasant-looking companion . Rebecca laid down the tray , and then , to her mistress 's surprise , turned back and shut the door . The girl 's face was very pale , and her manner was wild and excited . `` Here 's a note for you , '' she said . `` It was given Mrs. Jorrocks to give you , but I am better at climbing stairs than she is , so I brought it up . '' She handed Kate a little slip of paper as she spoke.A note for her ! Could it be that her friends had arrived and had managed to send a message to her ? It must be so . She took it from the maid . As she did so she noticed that the other 's hands were shaking as though she had the ague . `` You are not well , Rebecca , '' said Kate kindly . `` Oh yes , I am . You read your note and do n't mind me , '' the girl answered , in her usual surly fashion . Instead of leaving the room , she was bustling about the bed as though putting things in order.Kate 's impatience was too great to allow her to wait , so she untwisted the paper , which had no seal or fastening . She had hoped in her heart to see the name of her lover
