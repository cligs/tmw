servant . How dare you speak to me in such a way ? Leave my room this instant ! `` The girl stood her ground as though she intended to brazen it out , but Kate swept towards her with so much honest anger in her voice , and such natural dignity in her bearing , that she sank her bold gaze , and with a few muttered words slunk away into her own room . Kate closed the door behind her , and then , her sense of the ludicrous overpowering her anger , she laughed for the first time since she had been in the Priory . It was so intensely ridiculous that even the most foolish of mortals should imagine that she could , under any circumstances , be desirous of seeing Ezra Girdlestone . The very thought of him brought her amusement to an end , for the maid was right , and to-morrow would bring him down once more . Perhaps her friends might arrive before he did . God grant it ! It was a cold but a bright day . From her window she could see the snow-white sails of the Hampshire fishing-boats dipping and rising against the deep blue sea . A single barque rode amongst them , like a swan among ducklings , beating up against the wind for Portsmouth or Southampton . Away on the right was the long line of white foam which marked the Winner Sands . The tide was in and the great mudbanks had disappeared , save that here and there their dun-coloured convexity rose above the surface like the back of a sleeping leviathan . Overhead a great flock of wild geese were flapping their way southward , like a broad arrow against the sky . It was an exhilarating , bracing scene , and accorded well with her own humour . She felt so full of life and hope that she could hardly believe that she was the same girl who that very morning had hurled away the poison bottle , knowing in her heart that unless she destroyed it she might be tempted to follow her guardian 's sinister suggestions . Yet the incident was real enough , for there were the fragments of glass scattered over the bare planks of her floor , and the insidious odour of the drug was still so strong that she opened the window in order to dissipate it . Looking back at it now , it all seemed like some hideous nightmare.She had no very clear idea as to what she expected her friends to do.That she would be saved , and that speedily , she never for one instantdoubted . She had only to wait patiently and all would be well.By to-morrow night , at the latest , her troubles would be over.So thought Girdlestone too , as he sat down below , with his head bent upon his breast and his eyes looking moodily from under his shaggy brows at the glowing coals . To-morrow evening would settle the matter once and for ever . Burt and Ezra would be down by five o'clock , and that would be the beginning of the end . As to Burt 's future there was no difficulty about that . He was a broken man . If well supplied with unlimited liquor he would not live long to trouble them . He had nothing to gain , and everything to lose by denouncing them . Should the worst come to the worst , the ravings of a dipsomaniac could do little harm to a man as respected as the African merchant . Every event had been foreseen and provided for by the old schemer . Above all , he had devised a method by which even a coroner 's inquiry could be faced with impunity , and which would do away with all necessity for elaborate concealment.He beckoned Mrs. Jorrocks over to him , for he had been sitting in the large room , which was used both as a dining-room and as a kitchen . `` What is the latest train to-morrow ? '' he asked . `` There be one that reaches Bedsworth at a quarter to ten . `` `` It passes the grounds at about twenty to ten , then ? `` `` That reg'lar that I could set my clock by it . `` `` That 'll do . Where is Miss Harston ? `` `` Upstairs , sir . She came back a-laughin ' and a-jumpin ' and as sassy as you please to them as was old before she was born. '' '' Laughing ! '' said Girdlestone , raising his eyebrows . `` She did not seem in a laughing mood this morning . You do n't think she has gone out of her mind , do you ? `` `` I do n't know nought about that . There was Rebecca came down here a-cryin ' 'cause she 'd ordered her out of her room . Oh , she 's mistress of the house -- -there 's no doubt about that . She 'll be a-givin ' of us all the sack presently . `` Girdlestone relapsed into silence , but his face showed that he was puzzled by what he had heard.Kate slept a sound and dreamless sleep that night . At her age trouble is shaken from the young mind like water from the feathers of a duck . It had been all very gloomy and terrible while it lasted , but now the dawn of better days had come . She woke cheerful and light-hearted . She felt that when once she was free she could forgive her guardian and Rebecca and all of them -- -even Ezra . She would bury the whole hideous incident , and never think of it or refer to it again.She amused herself that morning by reckoning up in her mind what the sequence of events would be in London , and how long it would be before she heard from her friends . If Mrs. Scully had telegraphed , news would have reached them last night . Probably she would write as well , giving all the particulars about her . The post came in about nine o'clock , she thought . Then some time would elapse before the major could find Tom . After that , no doubt they would have to consider what had best be done , and perhaps would go and consult with Dr. Dimsdale . That would occupy the morning and part of the afternoon . They could hardly reach the Priory before nightfall.Ezra would be down by that time . On the Saturday before he had arrived between five and six . A great dread filled her soul at the thought of meeting the young merchant again . It was merely the natural instinct of a lady shrinking from whatever is rough and coarse and antagonistic . She had no conception of the impending danger , or of what his coming might mean to her.Mr . Girdlestone was more gracious to her than usual that morning at breakfast . He seemed anxious to efface the remembrance of his fierce and threatening words the day before . Rebecca , who waited upon them , was astonished to hear the way in which he spoke . His whole manner was less heavy and ungainly than usual , for now that the time for action was at hand he felt braced and invigorated , as energetic men do . `` You should study botany while you are down here , '' he said blandly . `` Depend upon it , one can not learn too many things in one 's youth . Besides , a knowledge of natural science teaches us the marvellous harmony which prevails throughout the universe , and so enlarges our minds . `` `` I should very much like to know something of it , '' answered Kate . `` My only fear is that I should not be clever enough to learn it . `` `` The wood here is full of wonders . The tiniest mushroom is as extraordinary and as worthy of study as the largest oak . Your father was fond of plants and animals . `` `` Yes , I can remember that , '' said Kate , her face growing sad as her mind travelled back to years gone by . What would that same father have thought , she wondered , had he known how this man opposite to her had treated her ! What did it matter now , though , when she would so soon be out of his power ! `` I remember , '' said Girdlestone , stirring his tea thoughtfully , `` when we lived in the City as 'prentice lads together , we shared a room above the shop . He used to have a dormouse that he was very fond of . All his leisure time was spent in nursing the creature and cleaning its cage . It seemed to be his only pleasure in life . One night it was running across the floor , and I put my foot upon it . `` `` Oh , poor papa ! '' cried Kate . `` I did it upon principle . 'You have devoted too much time to the creature , ' I said . 'Raise up your thoughts higher ! ' He was grieved and angry , but in time he came to thank me . It was a useful lesson . `` Kate was so startled by this anecdote that she remained silent for some little time . `` How old were you then ? '' she asked at last . `` I was about sixteen . `` `` Then you were always -- -inclined that way ? '' She found some difficulty in conveying her meaning in polite tones . `` Yes ; I received a call when I was very young . I became one of the elect at an early age . `` `` And which are the elect ? '' his ward asked demurely . `` The members of the Community of the Primitive Trinitarians -- -or , at least those of them who frequent Purbrook Street Chapel . I hold that the ministers in the other chapels that I have attended do not preach the unadulterated Word , and have therefore missed the narrow path . `` `` Then , '' said Kate , `` you think that no one will be saved except those who frequent the Purbrook Street Chapel ? `` `` And not all of them -- -no , nor one in ten , '' the merchant said confidently , and with some approach to satisfaction . `` Heaven must be a very small place , '' Kate remarked , as she rose from the table . `` Are you going out ? `` `` I was thinking of having a stroll in the wood . `` `` Think over a text as you walk . It is an excellent commencement of the day . `` `` What text should I think of ? '' she asked , standing smiling in the doorway , with the bright sunshine bursting in behind her . `` 'In the midst of life we are in death , ' '' he said solemnly . His voice was so hollow and stern that it struck a chill into the girl 's heart . The effect was only momentary , however . The day was so fine , and the breeze so fresh , that sadness was out of the question . Besides , was not her deliverance at hand ! On this of all mornings she should be free from vague presentiments and dim forebodings . The change in her guardian
