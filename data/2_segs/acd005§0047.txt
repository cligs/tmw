will it be ? Mount Desert ? Cape Cod ? Long Island ? `` `` Nay , lad , we are in the latitude of the St. Lawrence , and are more like to see the Arcadia coast . Then with this wind a day should carry us south , or two at the most . A few more such voyages and I shall buy myself a fair brick house in Green Lane of North Boston , where I can look down on the bay , or on the Charles or the Mystic , and see the ships comin ' and goin ' . So I would end my life in peace and quiet . `` All day Amos Green , in spite of his friend 's assurance , strained his eyes in the fruitless search for land , and when at last the darkness fell he went below and laid out his fringed hunting tunic , his leather gaiters , and his raccoon-skin cap , which were very much more to his taste than the broadcloth coat in which the Dutch mercer of New York had clad him . De Catinat had also put on the dark coat of civil life , and he and Adele were busy preparing all things for the old man , who had fallen so weak that there was little which he could do for himself . A fiddle was screaming in the forecastle , and half the night through hoarse bursts of homely song mingled with the dash of the waves and the whistle of the wind , as the New England men in their own grave and stolid fashion made merry over their home-coming.The mate 's watch that night was from twelve to four , and the moon was shining brightly for the first hour of it . In the early morning , however , it clouded over , and theGolden Rodplunged into one of those dim clammy mists which lie on all that tract of ocean . So thick was it that from the poop one could just make out the loom of the foresail , but could see nothing of the fore-topmast-stay sail or the jib . The wind was north-east with a very keen edge to it , and the dainty brigantine lay over , scudding along with her lee rails within hand 's touch of the water . It had suddenly turned very cold -- -so cold that the mate stamped up and down the poop , and his four seamen shivered together under the shelter of the bulwarks . And then in a moment one of them was up , thrusting with his forefinger into the air and screaming , while a huge white wall sprang out of the darkness at the very end of the bowsprit , and the ship struck with a force which snapped her two masts like dried reeds in a wind , and changed her in an instant to a crushed and shapeless heap of spars and wreckage.The mate had shot the length of the poop at the shock , and had narrowly escaped from the falling mast , while of his four men two had been hurled through the huge gap which yawned in the bows , while a third had dashed his head to pieces against the stock of the anchor . Tomlinson staggered forwards to find the whole front part of the vessel driven inwards , and a single seaman sitting dazed amid splintered spars , flapping sails , and writhing , lashing cordage . It was still as dark as pitch , and save the white crest of a leaping wave nothing was to be seen beyond the side of the vessel . The mate was peering round him in despair at the ruin which had come so suddenly upon them when he found Captain Ephraim at his elbow , half clad , but as wooden and as serene as ever . `` An iceberg , '' said he , sniffing at the chill air . `` Did you not smell it , friend Tomlinson ? `` `` Truly I found it cold , Captain Savage , but I set it down to the mist . `` `` There is a mist ever set around them , though the Lord in His wisdom knows best why , for it is a sore trial to poor sailor men . She makes water fast , Mr. Tomlinson . She is down by the bows already . `` The other watch had swarmed upon deck and one of them was measuring the well . `` There is three feet of water , '' he cried , `` and the pumps sucked dry yesterday at sundown . `` `` Hiram Jefferson and John Moreton to the pumps ! '' cried the captain . `` Mr. Tomlinson , clear away the long-boat and let us see if we may set her right , though I fear that she is past mending . `` `` The long-boat has stove two planks , '' cried a seaman . `` The jolly-boat , then ? `` `` She is in three pieces . `` The mate tore his hair , but Ephraim Savage smiled like a man who is gently tickled by some coincidence . `` Where is Amos Green ? `` `` Here , Captain Ephraim . What can I do ? `` `` And I ? '' asked De Catinat eagerly . Adele and her father had been wrapped in mantles and placed for shelter in the lee of the round house . `` Tell him he can take his spell at the pumps , '' said the Captain to Amos . `` And you , Amos , you are a handy man with a tool . Get into yonder long-boat with a lantern and see if you can not patch her up . `` For half an hour Amos Green hammered and trimmed and caulked , while the sharp measured clanking of the pumps sounded above the dash of the seas . Slowly , very slowly , the bows of the brigantine were settling down , and her stern cocking up . `` You 've not much time , Amos , lad , '' said the captain quietly . `` She 'll float now , though she 's not quite water-tight . `` `` Very good . Lower away ! Keep up the pump in there ! Mr. Tomlinson , see that provisions and water are ready , as much as she will hold . Come with me , Hiram Jefferson . `` The seaman and the captain swung themselves down into the tossing boat , the latter with a lantern strapped to his waist . Together they made their way until they were under her mangled bows . The captain shook his head when he saw the extent of the damage . `` Cut away the foresail and pass it over , '' said he.Tomlinson and Amos Green cut away the lashings with their knives and lowered the corner of the sail . Captain Ephraim and the seaman seized it , and dragged it across the mouth of the huge gaping leak . As he stooped to do it , however , the ship heaved up upon a swell , and the captain saw in the yellow light of his lantern sinuous black cracks which radiated away backwards from the central hole . `` How much in the well ? '' he asked . `` Five and a half feet . `` `` Then the ship is lost . I could put my finger between her planks as far as I can see back . Keep the pumps going there ! Have you the food and water , Mr . Tomlinson ? `` `` Here , sir . `` `` Lower them over the bows . This boat can not live more than an hour or two . Can you see anything of the berg ? `` `` The fog is lifting on the starboard quarter , '' cried one of the men . `` Yes , there is the berg , quarter of a mile to leeward ! `` The mist had thinned away suddenly , and the moon glimmered through once more upon the great lonely sea and the stricken ship . There , like a huge sail , was the monster piece of ice upon which they had shattered themselves , rocking slowly to and fro with the wash of the waves . `` You must make for her , '' said Captain Ephraim . `` There is no other chance . Lower the gal over the bows ! Well , then , her father first , if she likes it better . Tell them to sit still , Amos , and that the Lord will bear us up if we keep clear of foolishness . So ! You 're a brave lass for all your niminy-piminy lingo . Now the keg and the barrel , and all the wraps and cloaks you can find . Now the other man , the Frenchman . Ay , ay , passengers first , and you have got to come . Now , Amos ! Now the seamen , and you last , friend Tomlinson . `` It was well that they had not very far to go , for the boat was weighed down almost to the edge , and it took the baling of two men to keep in check the water which leaked in between the shattered planks . When all were safely in their places . Captain Ephraim Savage swung himself aboard again , which was but too easy now that every minute brought the bows nearer to the water . He came back with a bundle of clothing which he threw into the boat . `` Push off ! '' he cried . `` Jump in , then . `` `` Ephraim Savage goes down with his ship , '' said he quietly . `` FriendTomlinson , it is not my way to give my orders more than once . Push off , I say ! `` The mate thrust her out with a boat-hook . Amos and De Catinat gave a cry of dismay , but the stolid New Englanders settled down to their oars and pulled off for the iceberg. '' Amos ! Amos ! Will you suffer it ? '' cried the guardsman in French . `` My honour will not permit me to leave him thus . I should feel it a stain for ever . `` `` Tomlinson , you would not leave him ! Go on board and force him to come . `` `` The man is not living who could force him to do what he had no mind for . `` `` He may change his purpose . `` `` He never changes his purpose . `` `` But you can not leave him , man ! You must at least lie by and pick him up . `` `` The boat leaks like a sieve , '' said the mate . `` I will take her to the berg , leave you all there , if we can find footing , and go back for the captain . Put your heart into it , my lads , for the sooner we are there the sooner we shall get back . `` But they had not taken fifty strokes before Adele gave a sudden scream . `` My God ! '' she cried , `` the ship is going down ! `` She had settled lower and lower in the water , and suddenly with a sound of rending planks she thrust down her bows like a diving water-fowl , her stern flew up into the air , and with a long sucking noise she shot down swifter
