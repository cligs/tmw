direction . `` Has he gone ? '' quoth he. '' Gone ? Who ? `` `` He , the man with the red head , the giant man . `` `` Yes , '' said Alleyne , `` he hath gone . `` `` And comes not back ? '' '' No . `` `` The better for him ! '' cried the little man , with a long sigh of relief . `` Mon Dieu ! What ! am I not the champion of the Bishop of Montaubon ? Ah , could I have descended , could I have come down , ere he fled ! Then you would have seen . You would have beheld a spectacle then . There would have been one rascal the less upon earth . Ma foi , yes ! `` `` Good master Pelligny , '' said the landlord , `` these gentlemen have not gone very fast , and I have a horse in the stable at your disposal , for I would rather have such bloody doings as you threaten outside the four walls of mine auberge . `` `` I hurt my leg and can not ride , '' quoth the bishop 's champion . `` I strained a sinew on the day that I slew the three men at Castelnau . `` `` God save you , master Pelligny ! '' cried the landlord . `` It must be an awesome thing to have so much blood upon one 's soul . And yet I do not wish to see so valiant a man mishandled , and so I will , for friendship 's sake , ride after this Englishman and bring him back to you . `` `` You shall not stir , '' cried the champion , seizing the inn-keeper in a convulsive grasp . `` I have a love for you , Gaston , and I would not bring your house into ill repute , nor do such scath to these walls and chattels as must befall if two such men as this Englishman and I fall to work here . `` `` Nay , think not of me ! '' cried the inn-keeper . `` What are my walls when set against the honor of Francois Poursuivant d'Amour Pelligny , champion of the Bishop of Montaubon . My horse , Andre ! `` `` By the saints , no ! Gaston , I will not have it ! You have said truly that it is an awesome thing to have such rough work upon one 's soul . I am but a rude soldier , yet I have a mind . Mon Dieu ! I reflect , I weigh , I balance . Shall I not meet this man again ? Shall I not bear him in mind ? Shall I not know him by his great paws and his red head ? Ma foi , yes ! `` `` And may I ask , sir , '' said Alleyne , `` why it is that you call yourself champion of the Bishop of Montaubon ? `` `` You may ask aught which it is becoming to me to answer . The bishop hath need of a champion , because , if any cause be set to test of combat , it would scarce become his office to go down into the lists with leather and shield and cudgel to exchange blows with any varlet . He looks around him then for some tried fighting man , some honest smiter who can give a blow or take one . It is not for me to say how far he hath succeeded , but it is sooth that he who thinks that he hath but to do with the Bishop of Montaubon , finds himself face to face with Francois Poursuivant d'Amour Pelligny . `` At this moment there was a clatter of hoofs upon the road , and a varlet by the door cried out that one of the Englishmen was coming back . The champion looked wildly about for some corner of safety , and was clambering up towards the window , when Ford 's voice sounded from without , calling upon Alleyne to hasten , or he might scarce find his way . Bidding adieu to landlord and to champion , therefore , he set off at a gallop , and soon overtook the two archers . `` A pretty thing this , John , '' said he . `` Thou wilt have holy Church upon you if you hang her champions upon iron hooks in an inn kitchen . `` `` It was done without thinking , '' he answered apologetically , while Aylward burst into a shout of laughter . `` By my hilt ! mon petit , '' said he , `` you would have laughed also could you have seen it . For this man was so swollen with pride that he would neither drink with us , nor sit at the same table with us , nor as much as answer a question , but must needs talk to the varlet all the time that it was well there was peace , and that he had slain more Englishmen than there were tags to his doublet . Our good old John could scarce lay his tongue to French enough to answer him , so he must needs reach out his great hand to him and place him very gently where you saw him . But we must on , for I can scarce hear their hoofs upon the road . `` `` I think that I can see them yet , '' said Ford , peering down the moonlit road. '' Pardieu ! yes . Now they ride forth from the shadow . And yonder dark clump is the Castle of Villefranche . En avant camarades ! or Sir Nigel may reach the gates before us . But hark , mes amis , what sound is that ? `` As he spoke the hoarse blast of a horn was heard from some woods upon the right . An answering call rung forth upon their left , and hard upon it two others from behind them . `` They are the horns of swine-herds , '' quoth Aylward . `` Though why they blow them so late I can not tell . `` `` Let us on , then , '' said Ford , and the whole party , setting their spurs to their horses , soon found themselves at the Castle of Villefranche , where the drawbridge had already been lowered and the portcullis raised in response to the summons of Du Guesclin.Sir Tristram de Rochefort , Seneschal of Auvergne and Lord of Villefranche , was a fierce and renowned soldier who had grown gray in the English wars . As lord of the marches and guardian of an exposed country-side , there was little rest for him even in times of so-called peace , and his whole life was spent in raids and outfalls upon the Brabanters , late-comers , flayers , free companions , and roving archers who wandered over his province . At times he would come back in triumph , and a dozen corpses swinging from the summit of his keep would warn evil-doers that there was still a law in the land . At others his ventures were not so happy , and he and his troop would spur it over the drawbridge with clatter of hoofs hard at their heels and whistle of arrows about their ears . Hard he was of hand and harder of heart , hated by his foes , and yet not loved by those whom he protected , for twice he had been taken prisoner , and twice his ransom had been wrung by dint of blows and tortures out of the starving peasants and ruined farmers . Wolves or watch-dogs , it was hard to say from which the sheep had most to fear.The Castle of Villefranche was harsh and stern as its master . A broad moat , a high outer wall turreted at the corners , with a great black keep towering above all -- -so it lay before them in the moonlight . By the light of two flambeaux , protruded through the narrow slit-shaped openings at either side of the ponderous gate , they caught a glimpse of the glitter of fierce eyes and of the gleam of the weapons of the guard . The sight of the two-headed eagle of Du Guesclin , however , was a passport into any fortalice in France , and ere they had passed the gate the old border knight came running forwards with hands out-thrown to greet his famous countryman . Nor was he less glad to see Sir Nigel , when the Englishman 's errand was explained to him , for these archers had been a sore thorn in his side and had routed two expeditions which he had sent against them . A happy day it would be for the Seneschal of Auvergne when they should learn that the last yew bow was over the marches.The material for a feast was ever at hand in days when , if there was grim want in the cottage , there was at least rude plenty in the castle . Within an hour the guests were seated around a board which creaked under the great pasties and joints of meat , varied by those more dainty dishes in which the French excelled , the spiced ortolan and the truffled beccaficoes . The Lady Rochefort , a bright and laughter-loving dame , sat upon the left of her warlike spouse , with Lady Tiphaine upon the right . Beneath sat Du Guesclin and Sir Nigel , with Sir Amory Monticourt , of the order of the Hospitallers , and Sir Otto Harnit , a wandering knight from the kingdom of Bohemia . These with Alleyne and Ford , four French squires , and the castle chaplain , made the company who sat together that night and made good cheer in the Castle of Villefranche . The great fire crackled in the grate , the hooded hawks slept upon their perches , the rough deer-hounds with expectant eyes crouched upon the tiled floor ; close at the elbows of the guests stood the dapper little lilac-coated pages ; the laugh and jest circled round and all was harmony and comfort . Little they recked of the brushwood men who crouched in their rags along the fringe of the forest and looked with wild and haggard eyes at the rich , warm glow which shot a golden bar of light from the high arched windows of the castle.Supper over , the tables dormant were cleared away as by magic and trestles and bancals arranged around the blazing fire , for there was a bitter nip in the air . The Lady Tiphaine had sunk back in her cushioned chair , and her long dark lashes drooped low over her sparkling eyes . Alleyne , glancing at her , noted that her breath came quick and short , and that her cheeks had blanched to a lily white . Du Guesclin eyed her keenly from time to time , and passed his broad brown fingers through his crisp , curly black hair with the air of a man who is perplexed in his mind . `` These folk here , '' said the knight of Bohemia , `` they do not seem too well fed . `` `` Ah , canaille ! '' cried the Lord of Villefranche . `` You would scarce credit it , and yet it is sooth that when I was taken at Poictiers it was all that my wife and foster-brother could do to raise the money from them for my ransom .
