will you never ? `` `` May heaven wither my tongue first ! `` `` But consider , my daughter . Such love in a soul like yours is heaven 's gift , and sent for some wise purpose . This human love is too often but a noxious weed which blights the soil it grows in , but here it is a gracious flower , all fragrant with humility and virtue. '' '' Alas ! I have tried to tear it from my heart . `` `` Nay ; rather hold it firmly rooted there . Did the king but meet with some tenderness from you , some sign that his own affection met with an answer from your heart , it might be that this ambition which you profess would be secured , and that Louis , strengthened by the intimate companionship of your noble nature , might live in the spirit as well as in the forms of the Church . All this might spring from the love which you hide away as though it bore the brand of shame . `` The lady half rose , glancing from the prelate to the priest with eyes which had a lurking horror in their depths . `` Can I have understood you ! '' she gasped . `` What meaning lies behind these words ? You can not counsel me to -- - '' The Jesuit had risen , and his spare figure towered above her . `` My daughter , we give no counsel which is unworthy of our office . We speak for the interests of Holy Church , and those interests demand that you should marry the king . `` `` Marry the king ! '' The little room swam round her . `` Marry the king ! `` `` There lies the best hope for the future . We see in you a second Jeanne d'Arc , who will save both France and France 's king . `` Madame sat silent for a few moments . Her face had regained its composure , and her eyes were bent vacantly upon her tapestry frame as she turned over in her mind all that was involved in the suggestion . `` But surely -- -surely this could never be , '' she said at last , `` Why should we plan that which can never come to pass ? `` `` And why ? `` `` What King of France has married a subject ? See how every princess of Europe stretches out her hand to him . The Queen of France must be of queenly blood , even as the last was . `` `` All this may be overcome . `` `` And then there are the reasons of state . If the king marry , it should be to form a powerful alliance , to cement a friendship with a neighbour nation , or to gain some province which may be the bride 's dowry . What is my dowry ? A widow 's pension and a work-box . '' She laughed bitterly , and yet glanced eagerly at her companions , as one who wished to be confuted . `` Your dowry , my daughter , would be those gifts of body and of mind with which heaven has endowed you . The king has money enough , and the king has provinces enough . As to the state , how can the state be better served than by the assurance that the king will be saved in future from such sights as are to be seen in this palace to-day ? `` `` Oh , if it could be so ! But think , father , think of those about him -- - the dauphin , monsieur his brother , his ministers . You know how little this would please them , and how easy it is for them to sway his mind . No , no ; it is a dream , father , and it can never be . `` The faces of the two ecclesiastics , who had dismissed her other objections with a smile and a wave , clouded over at this , as though she had at last touched upon the real obstacle . `` My daughter , '' said the Jesuit gravely , `` that is a matter which you may leave to the Church . It may be that we , too , have some power over the king 's mind , and that we may lead him in the right path , even though those of his own blood would fain have it otherwise . The future only can show with whom the power lies . But you ? Love and duty both draw you one way now , and the Church may count upon you . `` `` To my last breath , father . `` `` And you upon the Church . It will serve you , if you in turn will but serve it . `` `` What higher wish could I have ? `` `` You will be our daughter , our queen , our champion , and you will heal the wounds of the suffering Church. '' '' Ah ! if I could ! `` `` But you can . While there is heresy within the land there can be no peace or rest for the faithful . It is the speck of mould which will in time , if it be not pared off , corrupt the whole fruit . `` `` What would you have , then , father ? `` `` The Huguenots must go . They must be driven forth . The goats must be divided from the sheep . The king is already in two minds . Louvois is our friend now . If you are with us , then all will be well . `` `` But , father , think how many there are ! `` `` The more reason that they should be dealt with . `` `` And think , too , of their sufferings should they be driven forth . `` `` Their cure lies in their own hands . `` `` That is true . And yet my heart softens for them . `` Pere la Chaise and the bishop shook their heads . Nature had made them both kind and charitable men , but the heart turns to flint when the blessing of religion is changed to the curse of sect . `` You would befriend God 's enemies then ? `` `` No , no ; not if they are indeed so . `` `` Can you doubt it ? Is it possible that your heart still turns towards the heresy of your youth ? `` `` No , father ; but it is not in nature to forget that my father and my grandfather -- - '' '' Nay , they have answered for their own sins . Is it possible that the Church has been mistaken in you ? Do you then refuse the first favour which she asks of you ? You would accept her aid , and yet you would give none in return . `` Madame de Maintenon rose with the air of one who has made her resolution . `` You are wiser than I , '' said she , `` and to you have been committed the interests of the Church . I will do what you advise . `` `` You promise it ? `` `` I do . `` Her two visitors threw up their hands together . `` It is a blessed day , '' they cried , `` and generations yet unborn will learn to deem it so . `` She sat half stunned by the prospect which was opening out in front of her . Ambitious she had , as the Jesuit had surmised , always been -- - ambitious for the power which would enable her to leave the world better than she found it . And this ambition she had already to some extent been able to satisfy , for more than once she had swayed both king and kingdom . But to marry the king -- -to marry the man for whom she would gladly lay down her life , whom in the depths of her heart she loved in as pure and as noble a fashion as woman ever yet loved man -- -that was indeed a thing above her utmost hopes . She knew her own mind , and she knew his . Once his wife , she could hold him to good , and keep every evil influence away from him . She was sure of it . She should be no weak Maria Theresa , but rather , as the priest had said , a new Jeanne d'Arc , come to lead France and France 's king into better ways . And if , to gain this aim , she had to harden her heart against the Huguenots , at least the fault , if there were one , lay with those who made this condition rather than with herself . The king 's wife ! The heart of the woman and the soul of the enthusiast both leaped at the thought.But close at the heels of her joy there came a sudden revulsion to doubt and despondency . Was not all this fine prospect a mere day-dream ? and how could these men be so sure that they held the king in the hollow of their hand ? The Jesuit read the fears which dulled the sparkle of her eyes , and answered her thoughts before she had time to put them into words . `` The Church redeems its pledges swiftly , '' said he . `` And you , my daughter , you must be as prompt when your own turn comes . `` `` I have promised , father . `` `` Then it is for us to perform . You will remain in your room all evening . `` `` Yes , father . `` `` The king already hesitates . I spoke with him this morning , and his mind was full of blackness and despair . His better self turns in disgust from his sins , and it is now when the first hot fit of repentance is just coming upon him that he may best be moulded to our ends . I have to see and speak with him once more , and I go from your room to his . And when I have spoken , he will come from his room to yours , or I have studied his heart for twenty years in vain . We leave you now , and you will not see us , but you will see the effects of what we do , and you will remember your pledge to us . '' They bowed low to her both together , and left her to her thoughts.An hour passed , and then a second one , as she sat in herfauteuil , her tapestry before her , but her hands listless upon her lap , waiting for her fate . Her life 's future was now being settled for her , and she was powerless to turn it in one way or the other . Daylight turned to the pearly light of evening , and that again to dusk , but she still sat waiting in the shadow . Sometimes as a step passed in the corridor she would glance expectantly towards the door , and the light of welcome would spring up in her gray eyes , only to die away again into disappointment . At last , however , there came a quick sharp tread , crisp and authoritative , which brought her to her feet with flushed
