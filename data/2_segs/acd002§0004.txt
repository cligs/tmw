before the terrible event occurred several people had seen a creature upon the moor which corresponds with this Baskerville demon , and which could not possibly be any animal known to science . They all agreed that it was a huge creature , luminous , ghastly , and spectral . I have cross-examined these men , one of them a hard-headed countryman , one a farrier , and one a moorland farmer , who all tell the same story of this dreadful apparition , exactly corresponding to the hell-hound of the legend . I assure you that there is a reign of terror in the district , and that it is a hardy man who will cross the moor at night . `` `` And you , a trained man of science , believe it to be supernatural ? `` `` I do not know what to believe . `` Holmes shrugged his shoulders . `` I have hitherto confined my investigations to this world , '' said he . `` In a modest way I have combated evil , but to take on the Father of Evil himself would , perhaps , be too ambitious a task . Yet you must admit that the footmark is material . `` `` The original hound was material enough to tug a man 's throat out , and yet he was diabolical as well . `` `` I see that you have quite gone over to the supernaturalists . But now , Dr. Mortimer , tell me this . If you hold these views , why have you come to consult me at all ? You tell me in the same breath that it is useless to investigate Sir Charles 's death , and that you desire me to do it . `` `` I did not say that I desired you to do it . `` `` Then , how can I assist you ? `` `` By advising me as to what I should do with Sir Henry Baskerville , who arrives at Waterloo Station '' -- -Dr. Mortimer looked at his watch -- - '' in exactly one hour and a quarter . `` `` He being the heir ? '' '' Yes . On the death of Sir Charles we inquired for this young gentleman and found that he had been farming in Canada . From the accounts which have reached us he is an excellent fellow in every way . I speak now not as a medical man but as a trustee and executor of Sir Charles 's will . `` `` There is no other claimant , I presume ? '' '' None . The only other kinsman whom we have been able to trace was Rodger Baskerville , the youngest of three brothers of whom poor Sir Charles was the elder . The second brother , who died young , is the father of this lad Henry . The third , Rodger , was the black sheep of the family . He came of the old masterful Baskerville strain and was the very image , they tell me , of the family picture of old Hugo . He made England too hot to hold him , fled to Central America , and died there in 1876 of yellow fever . Henry is the last of the Baskervilles . In one hour and five minutes I meet him at Waterloo Station . I have had a wire that he arrived at Southampton this morning . Now , Mr. Holmes , what would you advise me to do with him ? `` `` Why should he not go to the home of his fathers ? `` `` It seems natural , does it not ? And yet , consider that every Baskerville who goes there meets with an evil fate . I feel sure that if Sir Charles could have spoken with me before his death he would have warned me against bringing this , the last of the old race , and the heir to great wealth , to that deadly place . And yet it can not be denied that the prosperity of the whole poor , bleak countryside depends upon his presence . All the good work which has been done by Sir Charles will crash to the ground if there is no tenant of the Hall . I fear lest I should be swayed too much by my own obvious interest in the matter , and that is why I bring the case before you and ask for your advice . `` Holmes considered for a little time . `` Put into plain words , the matter is this , '' said he . `` In your opinion there is a diabolical agency which makes Dartmoor an unsafe abode for a Baskerville -- -that is your opinion ? `` `` At least I might go the length of saying that there is some evidence that this may be so. '' '' Exactly . But surely , if your supernatural theory be correct , it could work the young man evil in London as easily as in Devonshire . A devil with merely local powers like a parish vestry would be too inconceivable a thing . `` `` You put the matter more flippantly , Mr. Holmes , than you would probably do if you were brought into personal contact with these things . Your advice , then , as I understand it , is that the young man will be as safe in Devonshire as in London . He comes in fifty minutes . What would you recommend ? `` `` I recommend , sir , that you take a cab , call off your spaniel who is scratching at my front door , and proceed to Waterloo to meet Sir Henry Baskerville . `` `` And then ? `` `` And then you will say nothing to him at all until I have made up my mind about the matter . `` `` How long will it take you to make up your mind ? `` `` Twenty-four hours . At ten o'clock tomorrow , Dr. Mortimer , I will be much obliged to you if you will call upon me here , and it will be of help to me in my plans for the future if you will bring Sir Henry Baskerville with you . `` `` I will do so , Mr . Holmes . '' He scribbled the appointment on his shirt-cuff and hurried off in his strange , peering , absent-minded fashion . Holmes stopped him at the head of the stair . `` Only one more question , Dr. Mortimer . You say that before Sir Charles Baskerville 's death several people saw this apparition upon the moor ? `` `` Three people did . `` `` Did any see it after ? `` `` I have not heard of any . `` `` Thank you . Good-morning . `` Holmes returned to his seat with that quiet look of inward satisfaction which meant that he had a congenial task before him . `` Going out , Watson ? `` `` Unless I can help you . `` `` No , my dear fellow , it is at the hour of action that I turn to you for aid . But this is splendid , really unique from some points of view . When you pass Bradley 's , would you ask him to send up a pound of the strongest shag tobacco ? Thank you . It would be as well if you could make it convenient not to return before evening . Then I should be very glad to compare impressions as to this most interesting problem which has been submitted to us this morning . `` I knew that seclusion and solitude were very necessary for my friend in those hours of intense mental concentration during which he weighed every particle of evidence , constructed alternative theories , balanced one against the other , and made up his mind as to which points were essential and which immaterial . I therefore spent the day at my club and did not return to Baker Street until evening . It was nearly nine o'clock when I found myself in the sitting-room once more.My first impression as I opened the door was that a fire had broken out , for the room was so filled with smoke that the light of the lamp upon the table was blurred by it . As I entered , however , my fears were set at rest , for it was the acrid fumes of strong coarse tobacco which took me by the throat and set me coughing . Through the haze I had a vague vision of Holmes in his dressing-gown coiled up in an armchair with his black clay pipe between his lips . Several rolls of paper lay around him . `` Caught cold , Watson ? '' said he . `` No , it 's this poisonous atmosphere . `` `` I suppose it is pretty thick , now that you mention it. '' '' Thick ! It is intolerable . `` `` Open the window , then ! You have been at your club all day , I perceive . `` `` My dear Holmes ! `` `` Am I right ? `` `` Certainly , but how ? `` He laughed at my bewildered expression . `` There is a delightful freshness about you , Watson , which makes it a pleasure to exercise any small powers which I possess at your expense . A gentleman goes forth on a showery and miry day . He returns immaculate in the evening with the gloss still on his hat and his boots . He has been a fixture therefore all day . He is not a man with intimate friends . Where , then , could he have been ? Is it not obvious ? `` `` Well , it is rather obvious . `` `` The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes . Where do you think that I have been ? `` `` A fixture also . `` `` On the contrary , I have been to Devonshire . `` `` In spirit ? '' '' Exactly . My body has remained in this armchair and has , I regret to observe , consumed in my absence two large pots of coffee and an incredible amount of tobacco . After you left I sent down to Stamford 's for the Ordnance map of this portion of the moor , and my spirit has hovered over it all day . I flatter myself that I could find my way about . `` `` A large-scale map , I presume ? `` `` Very large . `` He unrolled one section and held it over his knee . `` Here you have the particular district which concerns us . That is Baskerville Hall in the middle . `` `` With a wood round it ? '' '' Exactly . I fancy the yew alley , though not marked under that name , must stretch along this line , with the moor , as you perceive , upon the right of it . This small clump of buildings here is the hamlet of Grimpen , where our friend Dr. Mortimer has his headquarters . Within a radius of five miles there are , as you see , only a very few scattered dwellings . Here is Lafter Hall , which was mentioned in the narrative . There is a house indicated here which may be the residence of the naturalist -- -Stapleton , if I remember right , was his name . Here are two moorland farmhouses , High Tor and Foulmire . Then fourteen miles away the great
