that ? '' I asked in astonishment . `` Never mind , '' said he , chuckling to himself . `` The question now is about hoemoglobin . No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of mine ? `` `` It is interesting , chemically , no doubt , '' I answered , `` but practically -- -- -- '' '' Why , man , it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years . Do n't you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains . Come over here now ! '' He seized me by the coat-sleeve in his eagerness , and drew me over to the table at which he had been working . `` Let us have some fresh blood , '' he said , digging a long bodkin into his finger , and drawing off the resulting drop of blood in a chemical pipette . `` Now , I add this small quantity of blood to a litre of water . You perceive that the resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water . The proportion of blood can not be more than one in a million . I have no doubt , however , that we shall be able to obtain the characteristic reaction . '' As he spoke , he threw into the vessel a few white crystals , and then added some drops of a transparent fluid . In an instant the contents assumed a dull mahogany colour , and a brownish dust was precipitated to the bottom of the glass jar. '' Ha ! ha ! '' he cried , clapping his hands , and looking as delighted as a child with a new toy . `` What do you think of that ? `` `` It seems to be a very delicate test , '' I remarked. '' Beautiful ! beautiful ! The old Guiacum test was very clumsy and uncertain . So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles . The latter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old . Now , this appears to act as well whether the blood is old or new . Had this test been invented , there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who would long ago have paid the penalty of their crimes. '' '' Indeed ! '' I murmured . `` Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point . A man is suspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed . His linen or clothes are examined , and brownish stains discovered upon them . Are they blood stains , or mud stains , or rust stains , or fruit stains , or what are they ? That is a question which has puzzled many an expert , and why ? Because there was no reliable test . Now we have the Sherlock Holmes ' test , and there will no longer be any difficulty . `` His eyes fairly glittered as he spoke , and he put his hand over his heart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his imagination . `` You are to be congratulated , '' I remarked , considerably surprised at his enthusiasm . `` There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year . He would certainly have been hung had this test been in existence . Then there was Mason of Bradford , and the notorious Muller , and Lefevre of Montpellier , and Samson of New Orleans . I could name a score of cases in which it would have been decisive . `` `` You seem to be a walking calendar of crime , '' said Stamford with a laugh . `` You might start a paper on those lines . Call it the 'Police News of the Past . ' '' '' Very interesting reading it might be made , too , '' remarked Sherlock Holmes , sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger . `` I have to be careful , '' he continued , turning to me with a smile , `` for I dabble with poisons a good deal . '' He held out his hand as he spoke , and I noticed that it was all mottled over with similar pieces of plaster , and discoloured with strong acids . `` We came here on business , '' said Stamford , sitting down on a high three-legged stool , and pushing another one in my direction with his foot . `` My friend here wants to take diggings , and as you were complaining that you could get no one to go halves with you , I thought that I had better bring you together . `` Sherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms with me . `` I have my eye on a suite in Baker Street , '' he said , `` which would suit us down to the ground . You do n't mind the smell of strong tobacco , I hope ? `` `` I always smoke 'ship 's ' myself , '' I answered . `` That 's good enough . I generally have chemicals about , and occasionally do experiments . Would that annoy you ? `` `` By no means . `` `` Let me see -- -what are my other shortcomings . I get in the dumps at times , and do n't open my mouth for days on end . You must not think I am sulky when I do that . Just let me alone , and I 'll soon be right . What have you to confess now ? It 's just as well for two fellows to know the worst of one another before they begin to live together . `` I laughed at this cross-examination . `` I keep a bull pup , '' I said , `` and I object to rows because my nerves are shaken , and I get up at all sorts of ungodly hours , and I am extremely lazy . I have another set of vices when I 'm well , but those are the principal ones at present . `` `` Do you include violin-playing in your category of rows ? '' he asked , anxiously . `` It depends on the player , '' I answered . `` A well-played violin is a treat for the gods -- -a badly-played one -- -- -- '' '' Oh , that 's all right , '' he cried , with a merry laugh . `` I think we may consider the thing as settled -- -that is , if the rooms are agreeable to you . `` `` When shall we see them ? `` `` Call for me here at noon to-morrow , and we 'll go together and settle everything , '' he answered . `` All right -- -noon exactly , '' said I , shaking his hand.We left him working among his chemicals , and we walked together towards my hotel . `` By the way , '' I asked suddenly , stopping and turning upon Stamford , `` how the deuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan ? `` My companion smiled an enigmatical smile . `` That 's just his little peculiarity , '' he said . `` A good many people have wanted to know how he finds things out. '' '' Oh ! a mystery is it ? '' I cried , rubbing my hands . `` This is very piquant . I am much obliged to you for bringing us together . 'The proper study of mankind is man , ' you know . `` `` You must study him , then , '' Stamford said , as he bade me good-bye . `` You 'll find him a knotty problem , though . I 'll wager he learns more about you than you about him . Good-bye . `` `` Good-bye , '' I answered , and strolled on to my hotel , considerably interested in my new acquaintance.WE met next day as he had arranged , and inspected the rooms at No . 221B , 5 Baker Street , of which he had spoken at our meeting . They consisted of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single large airy sitting-room , cheerfully furnished , and illuminated by two broad windows . So desirable in every way were the apartments , and so moderate did the terms seem when divided between us , that the bargain was concluded upon the spot , and we at once entered into possession . That very evening I moved my things round from the hotel , and on the following morning Sherlock Holmes followed me with several boxes and portmanteaus . For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and laying out our property to the best advantage . That done , we gradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new surroundings.Holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with . He was quiet in his ways , and his habits were regular . It was rare for him to be up after ten at night , and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out before I rose in the morning . Sometimes he spent his day at the chemical laboratory , sometimes in the dissecting-rooms , and occasionally in long walks , which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of the City . Nothing could exceed his energy when the working fit was upon him ; but now and again a reaction would seize him , and for days on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sitting-room , hardly uttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night . On these occasions I have noticed such a dreamy , vacant expression in his eyes , that I might have suspected him of being addicted to the use of some narcotic , had not the temperance and cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion.As the weeks went by , my interest in him and my curiosity as to his aims in life , gradually deepened and increased . His very person and appearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual observer . In height he was rather over six feet , and so excessively lean that he seemed to be considerably taller . His eyes were sharp and piercing , save during those intervals of torpor to which I have alluded ; and his thin , hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an air of alertness and decision . His chin , too , had the prominence and squareness which mark the man of determination . His hands were invariably blotted with ink and stained with chemicals , yet he was possessed of extraordinary delicacy of touch , as I frequently had occasion to observe when I watched him manipulating his fragile philosophical instruments.The reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody , when I confess how much this man stimulated my curiosity , and how often I endeavoured to break through the reticence which he showed on all that concerned himself . Before pronouncing judgment , however , be it remembered , how objectless was my life , and how little there was to engage my attention . My health forbade me from venturing out unless the weather was exceptionally genial , and I had no friends who would call upon me and break the monotony of my daily existence . Under these circumstances , I eagerly hailed the little mystery which hung around my companion , and spent much of my time in endeavouring to unravel it.He was not studying medicine .
