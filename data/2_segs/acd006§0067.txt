to have a poor appetite , but Burt ate voraciously , and filled his glass again and again from the jug . When the meal was finished and the ale all consumed , he rose with a grunt of repletion , and , pulling a roll of black tobacco from his pocket , proceeded to cut it into slices , and to cram it into his pipe . Ezra drew a chair up to the fire , and his father did the same , after ordering the old woman out of the room and carefully closing the door behind her . `` You have spoken to our friend here about the business ? '' Girdlestone asked , nodding his head in the direction of Burt. '' Yes . I have made it all clear . `` `` Five hundred pounds down , and a free passage to Africa , '' said Burt . `` An energetic man like you can do a great deal in the colonies with five hundred pounds , '' Girdlestone remarked . `` What I do with it is nothin ' to you , guv'nor , '' Burt remarked surlily . `` I does the job , you pays the money , and there 's an end as far as you are concerned . `` `` Quite so , '' the merchant said in a conciliatory voice . `` You are free to do what you like with the money . `` `` Without axin ' your leave , '' growled Burt . He was a man of such a turbulent and quarrelsome disposition that he was always ready to go out of his way to make himself disagreeable . `` The question is how it is to be done , '' interposed Ezra . He was looking very nervous and uneasy . Hard as he was , he had neither the pseudo-religious monomania of his father , nor the callous brutality of Burt , and he shuddered at the thought of what was to come . His eyes were red and bleared , and he sat with one arm thrown over the back of his chair , while he drummed nervously with the fingers of his other hand upon his knee . `` You 've got some plan in your head , I suppose , '' he said to his father . `` It 's high time the thing was carried through , or we shall have to put up the shutters in Fenchurch Street . `` His father shivered at the very thought . `` Anything rather than that , '' he said . `` It will precious soon come to that . It was the devil of a fight to keep things straight last week . `` `` What 's the matter with your lip ? It seems to be swollen . `` `` I had a turn with that fellow Dimsdale , '' Ezra answered , putting his hand up to his mouth to hide the disfigurement . `` He followed us to the station , and we had to beat him off ; but I think I left my marks upon him . `` `` He played some damned hokey-pokey business on me , '' said Burt . `` He tripped me in some new-fangled way , and nigh knocked the breath out of me . I do n't fall as light as I used . `` `` He did not succeed in tracing you ? '' Girdlestone asked uneasily . `` There is no chance of his turning up here and spoiling the whole business ? `` `` Not the least , '' said Ezra confidently . `` He was in the hands of a policeman when I saw him last . `` `` That is well . Now I should like , before we go further , to say a few words to Mr. Burt as to what has led up to this . `` `` You have n't got a drop to drink , boss ? `` `` Yes , yes , of course . What is that in the bottle over there ? Ginger wine . How will that do ? `` `` Here 's something better , '' Ezra said , rummaging in the cupboard . `` Here is a bottle of Hollands . It is Mrs. Jorrocks ' private store , I fancy . `` Burt poured himself out half a tumblerful , and filled it up with water . `` Drive along , '' he said ; `` I am lisnin ' . `` Girdlestone rose and stood with his back to the fire , and his hands under his coat-tails . `` I wish you to understand , '' he said , `` that this is no sudden determination of ours , but that events have led up to it in such a way that it was impossible to avoid it . Our commercial honour and integrity are more precious to us than anything else , and we have both agreed that we are ready to sacrifice anything rather than lose it . Unfortunately , our affairs have become somewhat involved , and it was absolutely necessary that the firm should have a sum of money promptly in order to extricate itself from its difficulties . This sum we endeavoured to get through a daring speculation in diamonds , which was , though I say it , ingeniously planned and cleverly carried out , and which would have succeeded admirably had it not been for an unfortunate chance . `` `` I remember , '' said Burt . `` Of course . You were there at the time . We were able to struggle along for some time after this on money which we borrowed and on the profits of our African trade . The time came , however , when the borrowed money was to be repaid , and once again the firm was in danger . It was then that we first thought of the fortune of my ward . It was enough to turn the scale in our favour , could we lay our hands upon it . It was securely tied up , however , in such a way that there were only two means by which we could touch a penny of it . One was by marrying her to my son ; the other was by the young lady 's death . Do you follow me ? `` Burt nodded his shaggy head . `` This being so , we did all that we could to arrange a marriage . Without flattery I may say that no girl was ever approached in a more delicate and honourable way than she was by my son Ezra . I , for my part , brought all my influence to bear upon her in order to induce her to meet his advances in a proper spirit . In spite of our efforts , she rejected him in the most decided way , and gave us to understand that it was hopeless to attempt to make her change her mind . `` `` Some one else , maybe , '' suggested Burt . `` The man who put you on your back at the station , '' said Ezra. '' Ha ! I 'll pay him for that , '' the navvy growled viciously . `` A human life , Mr. Burt , '' continued Girdlestone , `` is a sacred thing , but a human life , when weighed against the existence of a great firm from which hundreds derive their means of livelihood , is a small consideration indeed . When the fate of Miss Harston is put against the fate of the great commercial house of Girdlestone , it is evident which must go to the wall . `` Burt nodded , and poured some more Hollands from the square bottle . `` Having seen , '' Girdlestone continued , `` that this sad necessity might arise , I had made every arrangement some time before . This building is , as you may have observed in your drive , situated in a lonely and secluded part of the country . It is walled round too in such a manner that any one residing here is practically a prisoner . I removed the lady so suddenly that no one can possibly know where she has gone to , and I have spread such reports as to her condition that no one down here would be surprised to hear of her decease . `` `` But there is bound to be an inquiry . How about a medical certificate ? '' asked Ezra . `` I shall insist upon a coroner 's inquest , '' his father answered . `` An inquest ! Are you mad ? `` `` When you have heard me I think that you will come to just the opposite conclusion . I think that I have hit upon a scheme which is really neat -- -neat in its simplicity . '' He rubbed his hands together , and showed his long yellow fangs in his enjoyment of his own astuteness.Burt and Ezra leaned forward to listen , while the old man sank his voice to a whisper . `` They think that she is insane , '' he said. '' Yes . `` `` There 's a small door in the boundary wall which leads out to the railway line . `` `` Well , what of that ? `` `` Suppose that door to be left open , would it be an impossible thing for a crazy woman to slip out through it , and to be run over by the ten o'clock express ? `` `` If she would only get in the way of it . `` `` You do n't quite catch my idea yet . Suppose that the express ran over the dead body of a woman , would there be anything to prove afterwards that shewasdead , and not alive at the time of the accident ? Do you think that it would ever occur to any one 's mind that the express ran over a dead body ? `` `` I see your meaning , '' said his son thoughtfully . `` You would settle her , and then put her there . `` `` Of course . What could be more delightfully simple . Friend Burt here does his work ; we carry her through the garden gate , and lay her on the darkest part of the rails . Then we miss her at the house . There is an alarm and a search . The gate is found open . We naturally go through with lanterns , and find her on the line . I do n't think we need fear the coroner , or any one else then ? `` `` He 's a sharp 'un , is the guv'nor , '' cried Burt , slapping his thigh enthusiastically . `` It 's the downiest lay I have heard this many a day . `` `` I believe you are the devil incarnate , '' said Ezra , looking at his father with a mixture of horror and of admiration . `` But how about Jorrocks and Stevens and Rebecca ? Would you trust them ? `` `` Certainly not ! '' Girdlestone answered . `` It is not necessary . Mr. Burt can do his part of the business out of doors . We can entice her out upon some excuse . There is no reason why any one should have a suspicion of the truth . `` `` But they know that she is not mad . `` `` They will think that she did it on purpose . The secret will be locked up in our three breasts . After
