When all seemed black around me this morning , I tell you , Laura , that I seemed to turn to you and to your love as the one thing on earth upon which I could rely . All else seemed shifting , unstable , influenced by this or that base consideration . In you , and you only , could I trust . `` `` And I in you , dear Raffles ! I never knew what love was until I met you . `` She took a step towards him , her hands advanced , love shining in her features , when in an instant Raffles saw the colour struck from her face , and a staring horror spring into her eyes . Her blanched and rigid face was turned towards the open door , while he , standing partly behind it , could not see what it was that had so moved her. '' Hector ! '' she gasped , with dry lips.A quick step in the hall , and a slim , weather-tanned young man sprang forward into the room , and caught her up in his arms as if she had been a feather . `` You darling ! '' he said ; `` I knew that I would surprise you . I came right up from Plymouth by the night train . And I have long leave , and plenty of time to get married . Is n't it jolly , dear Laura ? `` He pirouetted round with her in the exuberance of his delight . As he spun round , however , his eyes fell suddenly upon the pale and silent stranger who stood by the door . Hector blushed furiously , and made an awkward sailor bow , standing with Laura 's cold and unresponsive hand still clasped in his . `` Very sorry , sir -- -did n't see you , '' he said . `` You 'll excuse my going on in this mad sort of way , but if you had served you would know what it is to get away from quarter-deck manners , and to be a free man . Miss McIntyre will tell you that we have known each other since we were children , and as we are to be married in , I hope , a month at the latest , we understand each other pretty well . `` Raffles Haw still stood cold and motionless . He was stunned , benumbed , by what he saw and heard . Laura drew away from Hector , and tried to free her hand from his grasp . `` Did n't you get my letter at Gibraltar ? '' she asked . `` Never went to Gibraltar . Were ordered home by wire from Madeira . Those chaps at the Admiralty never know their own minds for two hours together . But what matter about a letter , Laura , so long as I can see you and speak with you ? You have not introduced me to your friend here . `` `` One word , sir , '' cried Raffles Haw in a quivering voice . `` Do I entirely understand you ? Let me be sure that there is no mistake . You say that you are engaged to be married to Miss McIntyre ? `` `` Of course I am . I 've just come back from a four months ' cruise , and I am going to be married before I drag my anchor again . `` `` Four months ! '' gasped Haw . `` Why , it is just four months since I came here . And one last question , sir . Does Robert McIntyre know of your engagement ? `` `` Does Bob know ? Of course he knows . Why , it was to his care I left Laura when I started . But what is the meaning of all this ? What is the matter with you , Laura ? Why are you so white and silent ? And -- -hallo ! Hold up , sir ! The man is fainting ! `` `` It is all right ! '' gasped Haw , steadying himself against the edge of the door.He was as white as paper , and his hand was pressed close to his side as though some sudden pain had shot through him . For a moment he tottered there like a stricken man , and then , with a hoarse cry , he turned and fled out through the open door . `` Poor devil ! '' said Hector , gazing in amazement after him . `` He seems hard hit anyhow . But what is the meaning of all this , Laura ? `` His face had darkened , and his mouth had set.She had not said a word , but had stood with a face like a mask looking blankly in front of her . Now she tore herself away from him , and , casting herself down with her face buried in the cushion of the sofa , she burst into a passion of sobbing . `` It means that you have ruined me , '' she cried . `` That you have ruined-ruined -- -ruined me ! Could you not leave us alone ? Why must you come at the last moment ? A few more days , and we were safe . And you never had my letter . `` `` And what was in your letter , then ? '' he asked coldly , standing with his arms folded , looking down at her . `` It was to tell you that I released you . I love Raffles Haw , and I was to have been his wife . And now it is all gone . Oh , Hector , I hate you , and I shall always hate you as long as I live , for you have stepped between me and the only good fortune that ever came to me . Leave me alone , and I hope that you will never cross our threshold again . `` `` Is that your last word , Laura ? `` `` The last that I shall ever speak to you . `` `` Then , good-bye . I shall see the Dad , and go straight back to Plymouth . '' He waited an instant , in hopes of an answer , and then walked sadly from the room.It was late that night that a startled knocking came at the door of Elmdene . Laura had been in her room all day , and Robert was moodily smoking his pipe by the fire , when this harsh and sudden summons broke in upon his thoughts . There in the porch was Jones , the stout head-butler of the Hall , hatless , scared , with the raindrops shining in the lamplight upon his smooth , bald head . `` If you please , Mr. McIntyre , sir , would it trouble you to step up to the Hall ? '' he cried . `` We are all frightened , sir , about master . `` Robert caught up his hat and started at a run , the frightened butler trotting heavily beside him . It had been a day of excitement and disaster . The young artist 's heart was heavy within him , and the shadow of some crowning trouble seemed to have fallen upon his soul . `` What is the matter with your master , then ? '' he asked , as he slowed down into a walk . `` We do n't know , sir ; but we ca n't get an answer when we knock at the laboratory door . Yet he 's there , for it 's locked on the inside . It has given us all a scare , sir , that , and his goin's-on during the day . `` `` His goings-on ? `` `` Yes , sir ; for he came back this morning like a man demented , a-talkin ' to himself , and with his eyes starin ' so that it was dreadful to look at the poor dear gentleman . Then he walked about the passages a long time , and he would n't so much as look at his luncheon , but he went into the museum , and gathered all his jewels and things , and carried them into the laboratory . We do n't know what he 's done since then , sir , but his furnace has been a-roarin ' , and his big chimney spoutin ' smoke like a Birmingham factory . When night came we could see his figure against the light , a-workin ' and a-heavin ' like a man possessed . No dinner would he have , but work , and work , and work . Now it 's all quiet , and the furnace cold , and no smoke from above , but we ca n't get no answer from him , sir , so we are scared , and Miller has gone for the police , and I came away for you . `` They reached the Hall as the butler finished his explanation , and there outside the laboratory door stood the little knot of footmen and ostlers , while the village policeman , who had just arrived , was holding his bull's-eye to the keyhole , and endeavouring to peep through . `` The key is half-turned , '' he said . `` I ca n't see nothing except just the light . `` `` Here 's Mr. McIntyre , '' cried half-a-dozen voices , as Robert came forward . `` We 'll have to beat the door in , sir , '' said the policeman . `` We ca n't get any sort of answer , and there 's something wrong . `` Twice and thrice they threw their united weights against it until at last with a sharp snap the lock broke , and they crowded into the narrow passage . The inner door was ajar , and the laboratory lay before them.In the centre was an enormous heap of fluffy grey ash , reaching up half-way to the ceiling . Beside it was another heap , much smaller , of some brilliant scintillating dust , which shimmered brightly in the rays of the electric light . All round was a bewildering chaos of broken jars , shattered bottles , cracked machinery , and tangled wires , all bent and draggled . And there in the midst of this universal ruin , leaning back in his chair with his hands clasped upon his lap , and the easy pose of one who rests after hard work safely carried through , sat Raffles Haw , the master of the house , and the richest of mankind , with the pallor of death upon his face . So easily he sat and so naturally , with such a serene expression upon his features , that it was not until they raised him , and touched his cold and rigid limbs , that they could realise that he had indeed passed away.Reverently and slowly they bore him to his room , for he was beloved by all who had served him . Robert alone lingered with the policeman in the laboratory . Like a man in a dream he wandered about , marvelling at the universal destruction . A large broad-headed hammer lay upon the ground , and with this Haw had apparently set himself to destroy all his apparatus , having first used his electrical machines to reduce to protyle all the stock of gold which he had accumulated . The treasure-room which had so dazzled Robert consisted now of merely four bare walls , while the gleaming dust
