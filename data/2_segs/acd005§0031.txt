, then ? `` The guardsman made a movement of impatience . `` What was it ? How can you ask me , when you know as well as I do the wretched failure of my mission . It was the king 's wish that the archbishop should marry them . The king 's wish is the law . It must be the archbishop or none . He should have been at the palace by now . Ah , my God ! I can see the king 's cabinet , I can see him waiting , I can see madame waiting , I can hear them speak of the unhappy De Catinat -- - '' He buried his face in his hands once more . `` I see all that , '' said the American stolidly , `` and I see something more . `` `` What then ? `` `` I see the archbishop tying them up together . `` `` The archbishop ! You are raving. '' '' Maybe . But I see him . `` `` He could not be at the palace . `` `` On the contrary , he reached the palace about half an hour ago . `` De Catinat sprang to his feet . `` At the palace ! '' he screamed . `` Then who gave him the message ? `` `` I did , '' said Amos Green.If the American had expected to surprise or delight his companion by this curt announcement he was woefully disappointed , for De Catinat approached him with a face which was full of sympathy and trouble , and laid his hand caressingly upon his shoulder . `` My dear friend , '' said he , `` I have been selfish and thoughtless . I have made too much of my own little troubles and too little of what you have gone through for me . That fall from your horse has shaken you more than you think . Lie down upon this straw , and see if a little sleep may not -- - '' '' I tell you that the bishop is there ! '' cried Amos Green impatiently . `` Quite so . There is water in this jug , and if I dip my scarf into it and tie it round your brow -- - '' '' Man alive ! Do n't you hear me ! The bishop is there . `` `` He is , he is , '' said De Catinat soothingly . `` He is most certainly there . I trust that you have no pain ? `` The American waved in the air with his knotted fists . `` You think that I am crazed , '' he cried , `` and , by the eternal , you are enough to make me so ! When I say that I sent the bishop , I mean that I saw to the job . You remember when I stepped back to your friend the major ? `` It was the soldier 's turn to grow excited now . `` Well ? '' he cried , gripping the other 's arm . `` Well , when we send a scout into the woods , if the matter is worth it , we send a second one at another hour , and so one or other comes back with his hair on . That 's the Iroquois fashion , and a good fashion too . `` `` My God ! I believe that you have saved me ! `` `` You need n't grip on to my arm like a fish-eagle on a trout ! I went back to the major , then , and I asked him when he was in Paris to pass by the archbishop 's door. '' '' Well ? Well ? `` `` I showed him this lump of chalk . 'If we 've been there , ' said I , 'you 'll see a great cross on the left side of the door-post . If there 's no cross , then pull the latch and ask the bishop if he 'll come up to the palace as quick as his horses can bring him . ' The major started an hour after us ; he would be in Paris by half-past ten ; the bishop would be in his carriage by eleven , and he would reach Versailles half an hour ago , that is to say , about half-past twelve . By the Lord , I think I 've driven him off his head ! `` It was no wonder that the young woodsman was alarmed at the effect of his own announcement . His slow and steady nature was incapable of the quick , violent variations of the fiery Frenchman . De Catinat , who had thrown off his bonds before he had lain down , spun round the cell now , waving his arms and his legs , with his shadow capering up the wall behind him , all distorted in the moonlight . Finally he threw himself into his comrade 's arms with a torrent of thanks and ejaculations and praises and promises , patting him with his hands and hugging him to his breast . `` Oh , if I could but do something for you ! '' he exclaimed . `` If I could do something for you ! `` `` You can , then . Lie down on that straw and go to sleep . `` `` And to think that I sneered at you ! I ! Oh , you have had your revenge ! `` `` For the Lord 's sake , lie down and go to sleep ! '' By persuasions and a little pushing he got his delighted companion on to his couch again , and heaped the straw over him to serve as a blanket . De Catinat was wearied out by the excitements of the day , and this last great reaction seemed to have absorbed all his remaining strength . His lids drooped heavily over his eyes , his head sank deeper into the soft straw , and his last remembrance was that the tireless American was seated cross-legged in the moonlight , working furiously with his long knife upon one of the billets of wood.So weary was the young guardsman that it was long past noon , and the sun was shining out of a cloudless blue sky , before he awoke . For a moment , enveloped as he was in straw , and with the rude arch of the dungeon meeting in four rough-hewn groinings above his head , he stared about him in bewilderment . Then in an instant the doings of the day before , his mission , the ambuscade , his imprisonment , all flashed back to him , and he sprang to his feet . His comrade , who had been dozing in the corner , jumped up also at the first movement , with his hand on his knife , and a sinister glance directed towards the door . `` Oh , it 's you , is it ? '' said he , `` I thought it was the man . `` `` Has some one been in , then ? `` `` Yes ; they brought those two loaves and a jug of water , just about dawn , when I was settling down for a rest . `` `` And did he say anything ? `` `` No ; it was the little black one . `` `` Simon , they called him . `` `` The same . He laid the things down and was gone . I thought that maybe if he came again we might get him to stop . `` `` How , then ? `` `` Maybe if we got these stirrup leathers round his ankles he would not get them off quite as easy as we have done . `` `` And what then ? `` `` Well , he would tell us where we are , and what is to be done with us. '' '' Pshaw ! what does it matter since our mission is done ? `` `` It may not matter to you -- -there 's no accounting for tastes -- -but it matters a good deal to me . I 'm not used to sitting in a hole , like a bear in a trap , waiting for what other folks choose to do with me . It 's new to me . I found Paris a pretty close sort of place , but it 's a prairie compared to this . It do n't suit a man of my habits , and I am going to come out of it . `` `` There 's no help but patience , my friend . `` `` I do n't know that . I 'd get more help out of a bar and a few pegs . '' He opened his coat , and took out a short piece of rusted iron , and three small thick pieces of wood , sharpened at one end . `` Where did you get those , then ? `` `` These are my night 's work . The bar is the top one of the grate . I had a job to loosen it , but there it is . The pegs I whittled out of that log . `` `` And what are they for ? `` `` Well , you see , peg number one goes in here , where I have picked a hole between the stones . Then I 've made this other log into a mallet , and with two cracks there it is firm fixed , so that you can put your weight on it . Now these two go in the same way into the holes above here . So ! Now , you see , you can stand up there and look out of that window without asking too much of your toe joint . Try it . `` De Catinat sprang up and looked eagerly out between the bars . `` I do not know the place , '' said he , shaking his head . `` It may be any one of thirty castles which lie upon the south side of Paris , and within six or seven leagues of it . Which can it be ? And who has any interest in treating us so ? I would that I could see a coat of arms , which might help us . Ah ! there is one yonder in the centre of the mullion of the window . But I can scarce read it at the distance . I warrant that your eyes are better than mine , Amos , and that you can read what is on yonder escutcheon . `` `` On what ? `` `` On the stone slab in the centre window . `` `` Yes , I see it plain enough . It looks to me like three turkey-buzzards sitting on a barrel of molasses . `` `` Three allurions in chief over a tower proper , maybe . Those are the arms of the Provence De Hautevilles . But it can not be that . They have no chateau within a hundred leagues . No , I can not tell where we are . `` He was dropping back to the floor , and put his weight upon the bar.To his amazement , it came away in his hand . `` Look , Amos , look ! '' he cried . `` Ah , you 've found it out ! Well , I did that during the night . `` `` And how ? With your knife ? `` `` No ; I could make no way
