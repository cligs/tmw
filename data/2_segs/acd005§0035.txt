the minister of war . ' '' Here the reader choked with rage , and sat gurgling and drumming his fingers upon the table . `` Go on , Louvois , go on , '' said Louis , smiling up at the ceiling . `` 'These are the clouds which surround the sun , my dear nephew ; but the sun is , believe me , shining brightly behind them . For years I have known that noble nature as few others can know it , and I can tell you that his virtues are his own , but that if ever his glory is for an instant dimmed over , it is because his kindness of heart has allowed him to be swayed by those who are about him . We hope soon to see you back at Versailles , staggering under the weight of your laurels . Meanwhile accept my love and every wish for your speedy promotion , although it can not be obtained in the way which you suggest . ' '' '' Ah , '' cried the king , his love shining in his eyes , `` how could I for an instant doubt her ! And yet I had been so shaken by the others ! Francoise is as true as steel . Was it not a beautiful letter , Louvois ? `` `` Madame is a very clever woman , '' said the minister evasively . `` And such a reader of hearts ! Has she not seen my character aright ? `` `` At least she has not read mine , sire . `` There was a tap at the door , and Bontems peeped in . `` The archbishop has arrived , sire . `` `` Very well , Bontems . Ask madame to be so good as to step this way.And order the witnesses to assemble in the ante-room . `` As the valet hastened away , Louis turned to his minister : `` I wish you to be one of the witnesses , Louvois . `` `` To what , sire ? `` `` To my marriage . `` The minister started . `` What , sire ! Already ? `` `` Now , Louvois ; within five minutes . `` `` Very good , sire . '' The unhappy courtier strove hard to assume a more festive manner ; but the night had been full of vexation to him , and to be condemned to assist in making this woman the king 's wife was the most bitter drop of all . `` Put these letters away , Louvois . The last one has made up for all the rest . But these rascals shall smart for it , all the same . By-the-way , there is that young nephew to whom madame wrote . Gerard d'Aubigny is his name , is it not ? `` `` Yes , sire . `` `` Make him out a colonel 's commission , and give him the next vacancy , Louvois . `` `` A colonel , sire ! Why , he is not yet twenty . `` `` Ay , Louvois . Pray , am I the chief of the army , or are you ? Take care , Louvois ! I have warned you once before . I tell you , man , that if I choose to promote one of my jack-boots to be the head of a brigade , you shall not hesitate to make out the papers . Now go into the ante-room , and wait with the other witnesses until you are wanted . `` There had meanwhile been busy goings-on in the small room where the red lamp burned in front of the Virgin . Francoise de Maintenon stood in the centre , a little flush of excitement on her cheeks , and an unwonted light in her placid gray eyes . She was clad in a dress of shining white brocade , trimmed and slashed with silver serge , and fringed at the throat and arms with costly point lace . Three women , grouped around her , rose and stooped and swayed , putting a touch here and a touch there , gathering in , looping up , and altering until all was to their taste. '' There ! '' said the head dressmaker , giving a final pat to a rosette of gray silk ; `` I think that will do , your Majes -- -that is to say , madame . `` The lady smiled at the adroit slip of the courtier dressmaker . `` My tastes lean little towards dress , '' said she , `` yet I would fain look as he would wish me to look . `` `` Ah , it is easy to dress madame . Madame has a figure . Madame has a carriage . What costume would not look well with such a neck and waist and arm to set it off ? But , ah , madame , what are we to do when we have to make the figure as well as the dress ? There was the Princess Charlotte Elizabeth . It was but yesterday that we cut her gown . She was short , madame , but thick . Oh , it is incredible how thick she was ! She uses more cloth than madame , though she is two hand-breadths shorter . Ah , I am sure that the good God never meant people to be as thick as that . But then , of course , she is Bavarian and not French . `` But madame was paying little heed to the gossip of the dressmaker . Her eyes were fixed upon the statue in the corner , and her lips were moving in prayer -- -prayer that she might be worthy of this great destiny which had come so suddenly upon her , a poor governess ; that she might walk straight among the pitfalls which surrounded her upon every side ; that this night 's work might bring a blessing upon France and upon the man whom she loved . There came a discreet tap at the door to break in upon her prayer . `` It is Bontems , madame , '' said Mademoiselle Nanon . `` He says that the king is ready . `` `` Then we shall not keep him waiting . Come , mademoiselle , and may God shed His blessing upon what we are about to do ! `` The little party assembled in the king 's ante-room , and started from there to the private chapel . In front walked the portly bishop , clad in a green vestment , puffed out with the importance of the function , his missal in his hand , and his fingers between the pages at the servicede matrimoniis . Beside him strode his almoner , and two little servitors of the court in crimson cassocks bearing lighted torches . The king and Madame de Maintenon walked side by side , she quiet and composed , with gentle bearing and downcast eyes , he with a flush on his dark cheeks , and a nervous , furtive look in his eyes , like a man who knows that he is in the midst of one of the great crises of his life . Behind them , in solemn silence , followed a little group of chosen witnesses , the lean , silent Pere la Chaise , Louvois , scowling heavily at the bride , the Marquis de Charmarante , Bontems , and Mademoiselle Nanon.The torches shed a strong yellow light upon this small band as they advanced slowly through the corridors andsalonswhich led to the chapel , and they threw a garish glare upon the painted walls and ceilings , flashing back from gold-work and from mirror , but leaving long trailing shadows in the corners . The king glanced nervously at these black recesses , and at the portraits of his ancestors and relations which lined the walls . As he passed that of his late queen , Maria Theresa , he started and gasped with horror . `` My God ! '' he whispered ; `` she frowned and spat at me ! `` Madame laid her cool hand upon his wrist . `` It is nothing , sire , '' she murmured , in her soothing voice . `` It was but the light flickering over the picture . `` Her words had their usual effect upon him . The startled look died away from his eyes , and taking her hand in his he walked resolutely forwards . A minute later they were before the altar , and the words were being read which should bind them forever together . As they turned away again , her new ring blazing upon her finger , there was a buzz of congratulation around her . The king only said nothing , but he looked at her , and she had no wish that he should say more . She was still calm and pale , but the blood throbbed in her temples . `` You are Queen of France now , '' it seemed to be humming -- - '' queen , queen , queen ! `` But a sudden shadow had fallen across her , and a low voice was in her ear . `` Remember your promise to the Church , '' it whispered . She started , and turned to see the pale , eager face of the Jesuit beside her . `` Your hand has turned cold , Francoise , '' said Louis . `` Let us go , dearest . We have been too long in this dismal church . `` Madame de Montespan had retired to rest , easy in her mind , after receiving the message from her brother . She knew Louis as few others knew him , and she was well aware of that obstinacy in trifles which was one of his characteristics . If he had said that he would be married by the archbishop , then the archbishop it must be ; to-night , at least , there should be no marriage . To-morrow was a new day , and if it did not shake the king 's plans , then indeed she must have lost her wit as well as her beauty.She dressed herself with care in the morning , putting on her powder , her little touch of rouge , her one patch near the dimple of her cheek , her loose robe of violet velvet , and her casconet of pearls with all the solicitude of a warrior , who is bracing on his arms for a life and death contest . No news had come to her of the great event of the previous night , although the court already rang with it , for her haughtiness and her bitter tongue had left her without a friend or intimate . She rose , therefore , in the best of spirits , with her mind set on the one question as to how best she could gain an audience with the king.She was still in her boudoir putting the last touches to her toilet when her page announced to her that the king was waiting in hersalon . Madame de Montespan could hardly believe in such good fortune . She had racked her brain all morning as to how she should win her way to him , and here he was waiting for her . With a last glance at the mirror , she hastened to meet him.He was standing with his back turned , looking up at one of Snyders 's paintings , when she entered ; but as she closed the door , he turned and took two steps towards her . She
