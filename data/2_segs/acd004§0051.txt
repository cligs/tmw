not worthy to mix . And I have seen the aged Giotto , and he in turn was pupil to Cimabue , before whom there was no art in Italy , for the Greeks were brought to paint the chapel of the Gondi at Florence . Ah , signori , there are the real great men whose names will be held in honor when your soldiers are shown to have been the enemies of humankind . `` `` Faith , sir , '' said Ford , `` there is something to say for the soldiers also , for , unless they be defended , how are all these gentlemen whom you have mentioned to preserve the pictures which they have painted ? `` `` And all these ! '' said Alleyne . `` Have you indeed done them all ? -- -and where are they to go ? `` `` Yes , signor , they are all from my hand . Some are , as you see , upon one sheet , and some are in many pieces which may fasten together . There are some who do but paint upon the glass , and then , by placing another sheet of glass upon the top and fastening it , they keep the air from their painting . Yet I hold that the true art of my craft lies as much in the furnace as in the brush . See this rose window , which is from the model of the Church of the Holy Trinity at Vendome , and this other of the 'Finding of the Grail , ' which is for the apse of the Abbey church . Time was when none but my countrymen could do these things ; but there is Clement of Chartres and others in France who are very worthy workmen . But , ah ! there is that ever shrieking brazen tongue which will not let us forget for one short hour that it is the arm of the savage , and not the hand of the master , which rules over the world . `` A stern , clear bugle call had sounded close at hand to summon some following together for the night . `` It is a sign to us as well , '' said Ford . `` I would fain stay here forever amid all these beautiful things -- - '' staring hard at the blushing Tita as he spoke -- - '' but we must be back at our lord 's hostel ere he reach it . '' Amid renewed thanks and with promises to come again , the two squires bade their leave of the old Italian glass-stainer and his daughter . The streets were clearer now , and the rain had stopped , so they made their way quickly from the Rue du Roi , in which their new friends dwelt , to the Rue des Apotres , where the hostel of the `` Half Moon '' was situated . `` Mon Dieu ! Alleyne , saw you ever so lovely a face ? '' cried Ford as they hurried along together . `` So pure , so peaceful , and so beautiful ! `` `` In sooth , yes . And the hue of the skin the most perfect that ever I saw . Marked you also how the hair curled round the brow ? It was wonder fine . `` `` Those eyes , too ! '' cried Ford . `` How clear and how tender -- -simple , and yet so full of thought ! `` `` If there was a weakness it was in the chin , '' said Alleyne. '' Nay . I saw none . `` `` It was well curved , it is true . `` `` Most daintily so . `` `` And yet -- -- -- '' '' What then , Alleyne ? Wouldst find flaw in the sun ? `` `` Well , bethink you , Ford , would not more power and expression have been put into the face by a long and noble beard ? `` `` Holy Virgin ! '' cried Ford , `` the man is mad . A beard on the face of little Tita ! '' '' Tita ! Who spoke of Tita ? `` `` Who spoke of aught else ? `` `` It was the picture of St. Remi , man , of which I have been discoursing . `` `` You are indeed , '' cried Ford , laughing , `` a Goth , Hun , and Vandal , with all the other hard names which the old man called us . How could you think so much of a smear of pigments , when there was such a picture painted by the good God himself in the very room with you ? But who is this ? `` `` If it please you , sirs , '' said an archer , running across to them , `` Aylward and others would be right glad to see you . They are within here . He bade me say to you that the Lord Loring will not need your service to-night , as he sleeps with the Lord Chandos . `` `` By my faith ! '' said Ford , `` we do not need a guide to lead us to their presence . '' As he spoke there came a roar of singing from the tavern upon the right , with shouts of laughter and stamping of feet . Passing under a low door , and down a stone-flagged passage , they found themselves in a long narrow hall lit up by a pair of blazing torches , one at either end . Trusses of straw had been thrown down along the walls , and reclining on them were some twenty or thirty archers , all of the Company , their steel caps and jacks thrown off , their tunics open and their great limbs sprawling upon the clay floor . At every man 's elbow stood his leathern blackjack of beer , while at the further end a hogshead with its end knocked in promised an abundant supply for the future . Behind the hogshead , on a half circle of kegs , boxes , and rude settles , sat Aylward , John , Black Simon and three or four other leading men of the archers , together with Goodwin Hawtayne , the master-shipman , who had left his yellow cog in the river to have a last rouse with his friends of the Company . Ford and Alleyne took their seats between Aylward and Black Simon , without their entrance checking in any degree the hubbub which was going on . `` Ale , mes camarades ? '' cried the bowman , `` or shall it be wine ? Nay , but ye must have the one or the other . Here , Jacques , thou limb of the devil , bring a bottrine of the oldest vernage , and see that you do not shake it . Hast heard the news ? `` `` Nay , '' cried both the squires . `` That we are to have a brave tourney . `` `` A tourney ? `` `` Aye , lads . For the Captal du Buch hath sworn that he will find five knights from this side of the water who will ride over any five Englishmen who ever threw leg over saddle ; and Chandos hath taken up the challenge , and the prince hath promised a golden vase for the man who carries himself best , and all the court is in a buzz over it . `` `` Why should the knights have all the sport ? '' growled Hordle John . `` Could they not set up five archers for the honor of Aquitaine and of Gascony ? `` `` Or five men-at-arms , '' said Black Simon . `` But who are the English knights ? '' asked Hawtayne . `` There are three hundred and forty-one in the town , '' said Aylward , `` and I hear that three hundred and forty cartels and defiances have already been sent in , the only one missing being Sir John Ravensholme , who is in his bed with the sweating sickness , and can not set foot to ground . `` `` I have heard of it from one of the archers of the guard , '' cried a bowman from among the straw ; `` I hear that the prince wished to break a lance , but that Chandos would not hear of it , for the game is likely to be a rough one . `` `` Then there is Chandos . `` `` Nay , the prince would not permit it . He is to be marshal of the lists , with Sir William Felton and the Duc d'Armagnac . The English will be the Lord Audley , Sir Thomas Percy , Sir Thomas Wake , Sir William Beauchamp , and our own very good lord and leader . `` `` Hurrah for him , and God be with him ! '' cried several . `` It is honor to draw string in his service . `` `` So you may well say , '' said Aylward . `` By my ten finger-bones ! if you march behind the pennon of the five roses you are like to see all that a good bowman would wish to see . Ha ! yes , mes garcons , you laugh , but , by my hilt ! you may not laugh when you find yourselves where he will take you , for you can never tell what strange vow he may not have sworn to . I see that he has a patch over his eye , even as he had at Poictiers . There will come bloodshed of that patch , or I am the more mistaken . `` `` How chanced it at Poictiers , good Master Aylward ? '' asked one of the young archers , leaning upon his elbows , with his eyes fixed respectfully upon the old bowman 's rugged face . `` Aye , Aylward , tell us of it , '' cried Hordle John . `` Here is to old Samkin Aylward ! '' shouted several at the further end of the room , waving their blackjacks in the air . `` Ask him ! '' said Aylward modestly , nodding towards Black Simon . `` He saw more than I did . And yet , by the holy nails ! there was not very much that I did not see either . `` `` Ah , yes , '' said Simon , shaking his head , `` it was a great day . I never hope to see such another . There were some fine archers who drew their last shaft that day . We shall never see better men , Aylward . `` `` By my hilt ! no . There was little Robby Withstaff , and Andrew Salblaster , and Wat Alspaye , who broke the neck of the German . Mon Dieu ! what men they were ! Take them how you would , at long butts or short , hoyles , rounds , or rovers , better bowmen never twirled a shaft over their thumb-nails . `` `` But the fight , Aylward , the fight ! '' cried several impatiently . `` Let me fill my jack first , boys , for it is a thirsty tale . It was at the first fall of the leaf that the prince set forth , and he passed through Auvergne , and Berry , and Anjou , and Touraine . In Auvergne the maids are kind , but the wines are sour . In Berry
