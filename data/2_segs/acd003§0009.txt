think of this , Holmes ? Sholto was , on his own confession , with his brother last night . The brother died in a fit , on which Sholto walked off with the treasure . How 's that ? `` `` On which the dead man very considerately got up and locked the door on the inside. '' '' Hum ! There 's a flaw there . Let us apply common sense to the matter . This Thaddeus Sholto WAS with his brother ; there WAS a quarrel ; so much we know . The brother is dead and the jewels are gone . So much also we know . No one saw the brother from the time Thaddeus left him . His bed had not been slept in . Thaddeus is evidently in a most disturbed state of mind . His appearance is -- -well , not attractive . You see that I am weaving my web round Thaddeus . The net begins to close upon him . `` `` You are not quite in possession of the facts yet , '' said Holmes . `` This splinter of wood , which I have every reason to believe to be poisoned , was in the man 's scalp where you still see the mark ; this card , inscribed as you see it , was on the table ; and beside it lay this rather curious stone-headed instrument . How does all that fit into your theory ? `` `` Confirms it in every respect , '' said the fat detective , pompously . `` House is full of Indian curiosities . Thaddeus brought this up , and if this splinter be poisonous Thaddeus may as well have made murderous use of it as any other man . The card is some hocus-pocus , -- -a blind , as like as not . The only question is , how did he depart ? Ah , of course , here is a hole in the roof . '' With great activity , considering his bulk , he sprang up the steps and squeezed through into the garret , and immediately afterwards we heard his exulting voice proclaiming that he had found the trap-door . `` He can find something , '' remarked Holmes , shrugging his shoulders . `` He has occasional glimmerings of reason.Il n'y a pas des sots si incommodes que ceux qui ont de l'esprit ! `` `` You see ! '' said Athelney Jones , reappearing down the steps again . `` Facts are better than mere theories , after all . My view of the case is confirmed . There is a trap-door communicating with the roof , and it is partly open . `` `` It was I who opened it . `` `` Oh , indeed ! You did notice it , then ? '' He seemed a little crestfallen at the discovery . `` Well , whoever noticed it , it shows how our gentleman got away . Inspector ! `` `` Yes , sir , '' from the passage . `` Ask Mr. Sholto to step this way. -- -Mr . Sholto , it is my duty to inform you that anything which you may say will be used against you . I arrest you in the queen 's name as being concerned in the death of your brother . `` `` There , now ! Did n't I tell you ! '' cried the poor little man , throwing out his hands , and looking from one to the other of us . `` Do n't trouble yourself about it , Mr. Sholto , '' said Holmes . `` I think that I can engage to clear you of the charge . `` `` Do n't promise too much , Mr . Theorist , -- -do n't promise too much ! '' snapped the detective . `` You may find it a harder matter than you think . `` `` Not only will I clear him , Mr. Jones , but I will make you a free present of the name and description of one of the two people who were in this room last night . His name , I have every reason to believe , is Jonathan Small . He is a poorly-educated man , small , active , with his right leg off , and wearing a wooden stump which is worn away upon the inner side . His left boot has a coarse , square-toed sole , with an iron band round the heel . He is a middle-aged man , much sunburned , and has been a convict . These few indications may be of some assistance to you , coupled with the fact that there is a good deal of skin missing from the palm of his hand . The other man -- - '' '' Ah ! the other man -- - ? '' asked Athelney Jones , in a sneering voice , but impressed none the less , as I could easily see , by the precision of the other 's manner . `` Is a rather curious person , '' said Sherlock Holmes , turning upon his heel . `` I hope before very long to be able to introduce you to the pair of them. -- -A word with you , Watson . `` He led me out to the head of the stair . `` This unexpected occurrence , '' he said , `` has caused us rather to lose sight of the original purpose of our journey . `` `` I have just been thinking so , '' I answered . `` It is not right that Miss Morstan should remain in this stricken house. '' '' No . You must escort her home . She lives with Mrs. Cecil Forrester , in Lower Camberwell : so it is not very far . I will wait for you here if you will drive out again . Or perhaps you are too tired ? `` `` By no means . I do n't think I could rest until I know more of this fantastic business . I have seen something of the rough side of life , but I give you my word that this quick succession of strange surprises to-night has shaken my nerve completely . I should like , however , to see the matter through with you , now that I have got so far . `` `` Your presence will be of great service to me , '' he answered . `` We shall work the case out independently , and leave this fellow Jones to exult over any mare's-nest which he may choose to construct . When you have dropped Miss Morstan I wish you to go on to No . 3 Pinchin Lane , down near the water 's edge at Lambeth . The third house on the right-hand side is a bird-stuffer 's : Sherman is the name . You will see a weasel holding a young rabbit in the window . Knock old Sherman up , and tell him , with my compliments , that I want Toby at once . You will bring Toby back in the cab with you . `` `` A dog , I suppose . `` `` Yes , -- -a queer mongrel , with a most amazing power of scent . I would rather have Toby 's help than that of the whole detective force of London . `` `` I shall bring him , then , '' said I . `` It is one now . I ought to be back before three , if I can get a fresh horse . `` `` And I , '' said Holmes , `` shall see what I can learn from Mrs. Bernstone , and from the Indian servant , who , Mr. Thaddeus tell me , sleeps in the next garret . Then I shall study the great Jones 's methods and listen to his not too delicate sarcasms. ' Wir sind gewohnt das die Menschen verhoehnen was sie nicht verstehen . ' Goethe is always pithy . `` The police had brought a cab with them , and in this I escorted Miss Morstan back to her home . After the angelic fashion of women , she had borne trouble with a calm face as long as there was some one weaker than herself to support , and I had found her bright and placid by the side of the frightened housekeeper . In the cab , however , she first turned faint , and then burst into a passion of weeping , -- -so sorely had she been tried by the adventures of the night . She has told me since that she thought me cold and distant upon that journey . She little guessed the struggle within my breast , or the effort of self-restraint which held me back . My sympathies and my love went out to her , even as my hand had in the garden . I felt that years of the conventionalities of life could not teach me to know her sweet , brave nature as had this one day of strange experiences . Yet there were two thoughts which sealed the words of affection upon my lips . She was weak and helpless , shaken in mind and nerve . It was to take her at a disadvantage to obtrude love upon her at such a time . Worse still , she was rich . If Holmes 's researches were successful , she would be an heiress . Was it fair , was it honorable , that a half-pay surgeon should take such advantage of an intimacy which chance had brought about ? Might she not look upon me as a mere vulgar fortune-seeker ? I could not bear to risk that such a thought should cross her mind . This Agra treasure intervened like an impassable barrier between us.It was nearly two o'clock when we reached Mrs. Cecil Forrester 's . The servants had retired hours ago , but Mrs. Forrester had been so interested by the strange message which Miss Morstan had received that she had sat up in the hope of her return . She opened the door herself , a middle-aged , graceful woman , and it gave me joy to see how tenderly her arm stole round the other 's waist and how motherly was the voice in which she greeted her . She was clearly no mere paid dependant , but an honored friend . I was introduced , and Mrs. Forrester earnestly begged me to step in and tell her our adventures . I explained , however , the importance of my errand , and promised faithfully to call and report any progress which we might make with the case . As we drove away I stole a glance back , and I still seem to see that little group on the step , the two graceful , clinging figures , the half-opened door , the hall light shining through stained glass , the barometer , and the bright stair-rods . It was soothing to catch even that passing glimpse of a tranquil English home in the midst of the wild , dark business which had absorbed us.And the more I thought of what had happened , the wilder and darker it grew . I reviewed the whole extraordinary sequence of events as I rattled on through the silent gas-lit streets . There was the original problem : that at least was pretty clear now . The death of Captain Morstan , the sending of the pearls , the advertisement , the letter , -- -we had had light upon all those events . They had only led us , however , to a deeper and far more tragic
