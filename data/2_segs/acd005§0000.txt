It was the sort of window which was common in Paris about the end of the seventeenth century . It was high , mullioned , with a broad transom across the centre , and above the middle of the transom a tiny coat of arms -- -three caltrops gules upon a field argent -- -let into the diamond-paned glass . Outside there projected a stout iron rod , from which hung a gilded miniature of a bale of wool which swung and squeaked with every puff of wind . Beyond that again were the houses of the other side , high , narrow , and prim , slashed with diagonal wood-work in front , and topped with a bristle of sharp gables and corner turrets . Between were the cobble-stones of the Rue St. Martin and the clatter of innumerable feet.Inside , the window was furnished with a broad bancal of brown stamped Spanish leather , where the family might recline and have an eye from behind the curtains on all that was going forward in the busy world beneath them . Two of them sat there now , a man and a woman , but their backs were turned to the spectacle , and their faces to the large and richly furnished room . From time to time they stole a glance at each other , and their eyes told that they needed no other sight to make them happy.Nor was it to be wondered at , for they were a well-favoured pair . She was very young , twenty at the most , with a face which was pale , indeed , and yet of a brilliant pallor , which was so clear and fresh , and carried with it such a suggestion of purity and innocence , that one would not wish its maiden grace to be marred by an intrusion of colour . Her features were delicate and sweet , and her blue-black hair and long dark eyelashes formed a piquant contrast to her dreamy gray eyes and her ivory skin . In her whole expression there was something quiet and subdued , which was accentuated by her simple dress of black taffeta , and by the little jet brooch and bracelet which were her sole ornaments . Such was Adele Catinat , the only daughter of the famous Huguenot cloth-merchant.But if her dress was sombre , it was atoned for by the magnificence of her companion . He was a man who might have been ten years her senior , with a keen soldier face , small well-marked features , a carefully trimmed black moustache , and a dark hazel eye which might harden to command a man , or soften to supplicate a woman , and be successful at either . His coat was of sky-blue , slashed across with silver braidings , and with broad silver shoulder-straps on either side . A vest of white calamanca peeped out from beneath it , and knee-breeches of the same disappeared into high polished boots with gilt spurs upon the heels . A silver-hilted rapier and a plumed cap lying upon a settle beside him completed a costume which was a badge of honour to the wearer , for any Frenchman would have recognised it as being that of an officer in the famous Blue Guard of Louis the Fourteenth . A trim , dashing soldier he looked , with his curling black hair and well-poised head . Such he had proved himself before now in the field , too , until the name of Amory de Catinat had become conspicuous among the thousands of the valiant lessernoblessewho had flocked into the service of the king.They were first cousins , these two , and there was just sufficient resemblance in the clear-cut features to recall the relationship . De Catinat was sprung from a noble Huguenot family , but having lost his parents early he had joined the army , and had worked his way without influence and against all odds to his present position . His father 's younger brother , however , finding every path to fortune barred to him through the persecution to which men of his faith were already subjected , had dropped the `` de '' which implied his noble descent , and he had taken to trade in the city of Paris , with such success that he was now one of the richest and most prominent citizens of the town . It was under his roof that the guardsman now sat , and it was his only daughter whose white hand he held in his own . `` Tell me , Adele , '' said he , `` why do you look troubled ? `` `` I am not troubled , Amory , '' '' Come , there is just one little line between those curving brows . Ah , I can read you , you see , as a shepherd reads the sky . `` `` It is nothing , Amory , but -- - '' '' But what ? `` `` You leave me this evening . `` `` But only to return to-morrow . `` `` And must you really , really go to-night ? `` `` It would be as much as my commission is worth to be absent . Why , I am on duty to-morrow morning outside the king 's bedroom ! After chapel-time Major de Brissac will take my place , and then I am free once more . `` `` Ah , Amory , when you talk of the king and the court and the grand ladies , you fill me with wonder . `` `` And why with wonder ? `` `` To think that you who live amid such splendour should stoop to the humble room of a mercer . `` `` Ah , but what does the room contain ? `` `` There is the greatest wonder of all . That you who pass your days amid such people , so beautiful , so witty , should think me worthy of your love , me , who am such a quiet little mouse , all alone in this great house , so shy and so backward ! It is wonderful ! `` `` Every man has his own taste , '' said her cousin , stroking the tiny hand . `` It is with women as with flowers . Some may prefer the great brilliant sunflower , or the rose , which is so bright and large that it must ever catch the eye . But give me the little violet which hides among the mosses , and yet is so sweet to look upon , and sheds its fragrance round it . But still that line upon your brow , dearest . `` `` I was wishing that father would return . `` `` And why ? Are you so lonely , then ? `` Her pale face lit up with a quick smile . `` I shall not be lonely until to-night . But I am always uneasy when he is away . One hears so much now of the persecution of our poor brethren. '' '' Tut ! my uncle can defy them . `` `` He has gone to the provost of the Mercer Guild about this notice of the quartering of the dragoons . `` `` Ah , you have not told me of that . `` `` Here it is . '' She rose and took up a slip of blue paper with a red seal dangling from it which lay upon the table . His strong , black brows knitted together as he glanced at it . `` Take notice , '' it ran , `` that you , Theophile Catinat , cloth-mercer of the Rue St. Martin , are hereby required to give shelter and rations to twenty men of the Languedoc Blue Dragoons under Captain Dalbert , until such time as you receive a further notice . [ Signed ] De Beaupre ( Commissioner of the King ) . `` De Catinat knew well how this method of annoying Huguenots had been practised all over France , but he had flattered himself that his own position at court would have insured his kinsman from such an outrage . He threw the paper down with an exclamation of anger . `` When do they come ? `` `` Father said to-night . `` `` Then they shall not be here long . To-morrow I shall have an order to remove them . But the sun has sunk behind St. Martin 's Church , and I should already be upon my way . `` `` No , no ; you must not go yet . `` `` I would that I could give you into your father 's charge first , for I fear to leave you alone when these troopers may come . And yet no excuse will avail me if I am not at Versailles . But see , a horseman has stopped before the door . He is not in uniform . Perhaps he is a messenger from your father . `` The girl ran eagerly to the window , and peered out , with her hand resting upon her cousin 's silver-corded shoulder. '' Ah ! '' she cried , `` I had forgotten . It is the man from America.Father said that he would come to-day . `` `` The man from America ! '' repeated the soldier , in a tone of surprise , and they both craned their necks from the window . The horseman , a sturdy , broad-shouldered young man , clean-shaven and crop-haired , turned his long , swarthy face and his bold features in their direction as he ran his eyes over the front of the house . He had a soft-brimmed gray hat of a shape which was strange to Parisian eyes , but his sombre clothes and high boots were such as any citizen might have worn . Yet his general appearance was so unusual that a group of townsfolk had already assembled round him , staring with open mouth at his horse and himself . A battered gun with an extremely long barrel was fastened by the stock to his stirrup , while the muzzle stuck up into the air behind him . At each holster was a large dangling black bag , and a gaily coloured red-slashed blanket was rolled up at the back of his saddle . His horse , a strong-limbed dapple-gray , all shiny with sweat above , and all caked with mud beneath , bent its fore knees as it stood , as though it were overspent . The rider , however , having satisfied himself as to the house , sprang lightly out of his saddle , and disengaging his gun , his blanket , and his bags , pushed his way unconcernedly through the gaping crowd and knocked loudly at the door . `` Who is he , then ? '' asked De Catinat . `` A Canadian ? I am almost one myself . I had as many friends on one side of the sea as on the other . Perchance I know him . There are not so many white faces yonder , and in two years there was scarce one from the Saguenay to Nipissing that I had not seen . `` `` Nay , he is from the English provinces , Amory . But he speaks our tongue . His mother was of our blood . `` `` And his name ? `` `` Is Amos -- -Amos -- -ah , those names ! Yes , Green , that was it -- -Amos Green . His father and mine have done much trade together , and now his son , who , as I understand ,
