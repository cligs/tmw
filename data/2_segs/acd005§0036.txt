had run forward with a pretty little cry of joy , her white arms outstretched , and love shining on her face ; but he put out his hand , gently and yet with decision , with a gesture which checked her approach . Her hands dropped to her side , her lip trembled , and she stood looking at him with her grief and her fears all speaking loudly from her eyes . There was a look upon his features which she had never seen before , and already something was whispering at the back of her soul that to-day at least his spirit was stronger than her own . `` You are angry with me again , '' she cried.He had come with every intention of beginning the interview by telling her bluntly of his marriage ; but now , as he looked upon her beauty and her love , he felt that it would have been less brutal to strike her down at his feet . Let some one else tell her , then . She would know soon enough . Besides , there would be less chance then of a scene , which was a thing abhorrent to his soul . His task was , in any case , quite difficult enough . All this ran swiftly through his mind , and she as swiftly read it off in the brown eyes which gazed at her . `` You have something you came to say , and now you have not the heart to say it . God bless the kindly heart which checks the cruel tongue . `` `` No , no , madame , '' said Louis ; `` I would not be cruel . I can not forget that my life has been brightened and my court made brilliant during all these years by your wit and your beauty . But times change , madame , and I owe a duty to the world which overrides my own personal inclinations . For every reason I think that it is best that we should arrange in the way which we discussed the other day , and that you should withdraw yourself from the court . `` `` Withdraw , sire ! For how long ? `` `` It must be a permanent withdrawal , madame . `` She stood with clenched hands and a pale face staring at him . `` I need not say that I shall make your retirement a happy one as far as in me lies . Your allowance shall be fixed by yourself ; a palace shall be erected for you in whatever part of France you may prefer , provided that it is twenty miles from Paris . An estate also -- - '' '' Oh , sire , how can you think that such things as these would compensate me for the loss of your love ? '' Her heart had turned to lead within her breast . Had he spoken hotly and angrily she might have hoped to turn him as she had done before ; but this gentle and yet firm bearing was new to him , and she felt that all her arts were vain against it . His coolness enraged her , and yet she strove to choke down her passion and to preserve the humble attitude which was least natural to her haughty and vehement spirit ; but soon the effort became too much for her . `` Madame , '' said he , `` I have thought well over this matter , and it must be as I say . There is no other way at all . Since we must part , the parting had best be short and sharp . Believe me , it is no pleasant matter for me either . I have ordered your brother to have his carriage at the postern at nine o'clock , for I thought that perhaps you would wish to retire after nightfall . `` `` To hide my shame from a laughing court ! It was thoughtful of you , sire . And yet , perhaps , this too was a duty , since we hear so much of duties nowadays , for who was it but you -- - '' '' I know , madame , I know . I confess it . I have wronged you deeply.Believe me that every atonement which is in my power shall be made.Nay , do not look so angrily at me , I beg . Let our last sight of eachother be one which may leave a pleasant memory behind it . `` `` A pleasant memory ! '' All the gentleness and humility had fallen from her now , and her voice had the hard ring of contempt and of anger . `` A pleasant memory ! It may well be pleasant to you , who are released from the woman whom you ruined , who can turn now to another without any pale face to be seen within thesalonsof your court to remind you of your perfidy . But to me , pining in some lonely country house , spurned by my husband , despised by my family , the scorn and jest of France , far from all which gave a charm to life , far from the man for whose love I have sacrificed everything -- -this will be a very pleasant memory to me , you may be sure ! `` The king 's eyes had caught the angry gleam which shot from hers , and yet he strove hard to set a curb upon his temper . When such a matter had to be discussed between the proudest man and the haughtiest woman in all France , one or the other must yield a point . He felt that it was for him to do so , and yet it did not come kindly to his imperious nature . `` There is nothing to be gained , madame , '' said he , `` by using words which are neither seemly for your tongue nor for my ears . You will do me the justice to confess that where I might command I am now entreating , and that instead of ordering you as my subject , I am persuading you as my friend . `` `` Oh , you show too much consideration , sire ! Our relations of twenty years or so can scarce suffice to explain such forbearance from you . I should indeed be grateful that you have not set your archers of the guard upon me , or marched me from the palace between a file of your musketeers . Sire , how can I thank you for this forbearance ? '' She curtsied low , with her face set in a mocking smile . `` Your words are bitter , madame . `` `` My heart is bitter , sire . `` `` Nay , Francoise , be reasonable , I implore you . We have both left our youth behind . `` `` The allusion to my years comes gratefully from your lips . `` `` Ah , you distort my words . Then I shall say no more . You may not see me again , madame . Is there no question which you would wish to ask me before I go ? `` `` Good God ! '' she cried ; `` is this a man ? Has it a heart ? Are these the lips which have told me so often that he loved me ? Are these the eyes which have looked so fondly into mine ? Can you then thrust away a woman whose life has been yours as you put away the St. Germain palace when a more showy one was ready for you ? And this is the end of all those vows , those sweet whispers , those persuasions , those promises -- -This ! `` `` Nay , madame , this is painful to both of us. '' '' Pain ! Where is the pain in your face ? I see anger in it because I have dared to speak truth ; I see joy in it because you feel that your vile task is done . But where is the pain ? Ah , when I am gone all will be so easy to you -- -will it not ? You can go back then to your governess -- - '' '' Madame ! `` `` Yes , yes , you can not frighten me ! What do I care for all that you can do ! But I know all . Do not think that I am blind . And so you would even have married her ! You , the descendant of St. Louis , and she the Scarron widow , the poor drudge whom in charity I took into my household ! Ah , how your courtiers will smile ! how the little poets will scribble ! how the wits will whisper ! You do not hear of these things , of course , but they are a little painful for your friends . `` `` My patience can bear no more , '' cried the king furiously . `` I leave you , madame , and forever . `` But her fury had swept all fear and discretion from her mind . She stepped between the door and him , her face flushed , her eyes blazing , her face thrust a little forward , one small white satin slipper tapping upon the carpet . `` You are in haste , sire ! She is waiting for you , doubtless . `` `` Let me pass , madame . `` `` But it was a disappointment last night , was it not , my poor sire ? Ah , and for the governess , what a blow ! Great heaven , what a blow ! No archbishop ! No marriage ! All the pretty plan gone wrong ! Was itnot cruel ? `` Louis gazed at the beautiful furious face in bewilderment , and it flashed across his mind that perhaps her grief had turned her brain . What else could be the meaning of this wild talk of the archbishop and the disappointment ? It would be unworthy of him to speak harshly to one who was so afflicted . He must soothe her , and , above all , he must get away from her . `` You have had the keeping of a good many of my family jewels , '' said he . `` I beg that you will still retain them as a small sign of my regard . `` He had hoped to please her and to calm her , but in an instant she was over at her treasure-cupboard hurling double handfuls of precious stones down at his feet . They clinked and rattled , the little pellets of red and yellow and green , rolling , glinting over the floor and rapping up against the oak panels at the base of the walls . `` They will do for the governess if the archbishop comes at last , '' she cried.He was more convinced than ever that she had lost her wits . A thought struck him by which he might appeal to all that was softer and more gentle in her nature . He stepped swiftly to the door , pushed it half open , and gave a whispered order . A youth with long golden hair waving down over his black velvet doublet entered the room . It was her youngest son , the Count of Toulouse . `` I thought that you would wish to bid him farewell , '' said Louis.She stood staring as though unable to realise the significance of his words .
