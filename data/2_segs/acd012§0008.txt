resuscitating ourselves we have already consumed a considerable proportion of this first tube . `` `` Does it matter ? '' asked Lord John , who was standing with his hands in his pockets close to the window . `` If we have to go , what is the use of holdin ' on ? You do n't suppose there 's any chance for us ? `` Challenger smiled and shook his head . `` Well , then , do n't you think there is more dignity in takin ' the jump and not waitin ' to be pushed in ? If it must be so , I 'm for sayin ' our prayers , turnin ' off the gas , and openin ' the window . `` `` Why not ? '' said the lady bravely . `` Surely , George , Lord John is right and it is better so . `` `` I most strongly object , '' cried Summerlee in a querulous voice . `` When we must die let us by all means die , but to deliberately anticipate death seems to me to be a foolish and unjustifiable action . `` `` What does our young friend say to it ? '' asked Challenger . `` I think we should see it to the end . `` `` And I am strongly of the same opinion , '' said he . `` Then , George , if you say so , I think so too , '' cried the lady . `` Well , well , I 'm only puttin ' it as an argument , '' said Lord John . `` If you all want to see it through I am with you . It 's dooced interestin ' , and no mistake about that . I 've had my share of adventures in my life , and as many thrills as most folk , but I 'm endin ' on my top note . `` `` Granting the continuity of life , '' said Challenger . `` A large assumption ! '' cried Summerlee . Challenger stared at him in silent reproof . `` Granting the continuity of life , '' said he , in his most didactic manner , `` none of us can predicate what opportunities of observation one may have from what we may call the spirit plane to the plane of matter . It surely must be evident to the most obtuse person '' ( here he glared a Summerlee ) `` that it is while we are ourselves material that we are most fitted to watch and form a judgment upon material phenomena . Therefore it is only by keeping alive for these few extra hours that we can hope to carry on with us to some future existence a clear conception of the most stupendous event that the world , or the universe so far as we know it , has ever encountered . To me it would seem a deplorable thing that we should in any way curtail by so much as a minute so wonderful an experience . `` `` I am strongly of the same opinion , '' cried Summerlee . `` Carried without a division , '' said Lord John . `` By George , that poor devil of a chauffeur of yours down in the yard has made his last journey . No use makin ' a sally and bringin ' him in ? `` `` It would be absolute madness , '' cried Summerlee . `` Well , I suppose it would , '' said Lord John . `` It could n't help him and would scatter our gas all over the house , even if we ever got back alive . My word , look at the little birds under the trees ! `` We drew four chairs up to the long , low window , the lady still resting with closed eyes upon the settee . I remember that the monstrous and grotesque idea crossed my mind -- -the illusion may have been heightened by the heavy stuffiness of the air which we were breathing -- -that we were in four front seats of the stalls at the last act of the drama of the world.In the immediate foreground , beneath our very eyes , was the small yard with the half-cleaned motor-car standing in it . Austin , the chauffeur , had received his final notice at last , for he was sprawling beside the wheel , with a great black bruise upon his forehead where it had struck the step or mud-guard in falling . He still held in his hand the nozzle of the hose with which he had been washing down his machine . A couple of small plane trees stood in the corner of the yard , and underneath them lay several pathetic little balls of fluffy feathers , with tiny feet uplifted . The sweep of death 's scythe had included everything , great and small , within its swath.Over the wall of the yard we looked down upon the winding road , which led to the station . A group of the reapers whom we had seen running from the fields were lying all pell-mell , their bodies crossing each other , at the bottom of it . Farther up , the nurse-girl lay with her head and shoulders propped against the slope of the grassy bank . She had taken the baby from the perambulator , and it was a motionless bundle of wraps in her arms . Close behind her a tiny patch upon the roadside showed where the little boy was stretched . Still nearer to us was the dead cab-horse , kneeling between the shafts . The old driver was hanging over the splash-board like some grotesque scarecrow , his arms dangling absurdly in front of him . Through the window we could dimly discern that a young man was seated inside . The door was swinging open and his hand was grasping the handle , as if he had attempted to leap forth at the last instant . In the middle distance lay the golf links , dotted as they had been in the morning with the dark figures of the golfers , lying motionless upon the grass of the course or among the heather which skirted it . On one particular green there were eight bodies stretched where a foursome with its caddies had held to their game to the last . No bird flew in the blue vault of heaven , no man or beast moved upon the vast countryside which lay before us . The evening sun shone its peaceful radiance across it , but there brooded over it all the stillness and the silence of universal death -- -a death in which we were so soon to join . At the present instant that one frail sheet of glass , by holding in the extra oxygen which counteracted the poisoned ether , shut us off from the fate of all our kind . For a few short hours the knowledge and foresight of one man could preserve our little oasis of life in the vast desert of death and save us from participation in the common catastrophe . Then the gas would run low , we too should lie gasping upon that cherry-coloured boudoir carpet , and the fate of the human race and of all earthly life would be complete . For a long time , in a mood which was too solemn for speech , we looked out at the tragic world . `` There is a house on fire , '' said Challenger at last , pointing to a column of smoke which rose above the trees . `` There will , I expect , be many such -- -possibly whole cities in flames -- -when we consider how many folk may have dropped with lights in their hands . The fact of combustion is in itself enough to show that the proportion of oxygen in the atmosphere is normal and that it is the ether which is at fault . Ah , there you see another blaze on the top of Crowborough Hill . It is the golf clubhouse , or I am mistaken . There is the church clock chiming the hour . It would interest our philosophers to know that man-made mechanisms have survived the race who made it . `` `` By George ! '' cried Lord John , rising excitedly from his chair . `` What 's that puff of smoke ? It 's a train . `` We heard the roar of it , and presently it came flying into sight , going at what seemed to me to be a prodigious speed . Whence it had come , or how far , we had no means of knowing . Only by some miracle of luck could it have gone any distance . But now we were to see the terrific end of its career . A train of coal trucks stood motionless upon the line . We held our breath as the express roared along the same track . The crash was horrible . Engine and carriages piled themselves into a hill of splintered wood and twisted iron . Red spurts of flame flickered up from the wreckage until it was all ablaze . For half an hour we sat with hardly a word , stunned by the stupendous sight . `` Poor , poor people ! '' cried Mrs . Challenger at last , clinging with a whimper to her husband 's arm . `` My dear , the passengers on that train were no more animate than the coals into which they crashed or the carbon which they have now become , '' said Challenger , stroking her hand soothingly . `` It was a train of the living when it left Victoria , but it was driven and freighted by the dead long before it reached its fate . `` `` All over the world the same thing must be going on , '' said I as a vision of strange happenings rose before me . `` Think of the ships at sea -- -how they will steam on and on , until the furnaces die down or until they run full tilt upon some beach . The sailing ships too -- -how they will back and fill with their cargoes of dead sailors , while their timbers rot and their joints leak , till one by one they sink below the surface . Perhaps a century hence the Atlantic may still be dotted with the old drifting derelicts . `` `` And the folk in the coal-mines , '' said Summerlee with a dismal chuckle . `` If ever geologists should by any chance live upon earth again they will have some strange theories of the existence of man in carboniferous strata . `` `` I do n't profess to know about such things , '' remarked Lord John , `` but it seems to me the earth will be 'To let , empty , ' after this . When once our human crowd is wiped off it , how will it ever get on again ? `` `` The world was empty before , '' Challenger answered gravely . `` Under laws which in their inception are beyond and above us , it became peopled . Why may the same process not happen again ? `` `` My dear Challenger , you ca n't mean that ? `` `` I am not in the habit , Professor Summerlee , of saying things which I do not mean . The observation is trivial . '' Out went the beard and down came the eyelids . `` Well , you lived an obstinate dogmatist , and you mean to
