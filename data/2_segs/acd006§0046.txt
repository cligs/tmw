his hostess played against Captain Livingstone Tuck and an old gentleman who came from Lambeth , with the result that the gallant captain and his partner rose up poorer and sadder men , which was rather a blow to the former , who reckoned upon clearing a little on such occasions , and had not expected to find himself opposed by such a past master of the art as the major . Then the veteran and another played the hostess and another lady , and the cunning old dog managed to lose in such a natural manner , and to pay up with such a good grace , and with so many pretty speeches and compliments , that the widow 's partner was visibly impressed , a fact which , curiously enough , seemed to be anything but agreeable to the widow . After that they all filed off to supper , where they found the dancers already in possession , and there was much crushing and crowding , which tended to do away with ceremony and to promote the harmony of the evening.If the major had contrived to win favour from Mrs. Lavinia Scully in the early part of the evening , he managed now to increase any advantage he had gained . In the first place he inquired in a very loud voice of Captain Tuck , at the other end of the table , whether that gentleman had ever met the deceased Major-General Scully , and being answered in the negative , he descanted fluently upon the merits of that imaginary warrior . After this unscrupulous manoeuvre the major proceeded to do justice to the wine and to indulge in sporting reminiscences , and military reminiscences , and travelling reminiscences , and social reminiscences , all of which he treated in a manner which called forth the admiration of his audience . Then , when supper had at last been finished , and the last cork drawn and the last glass filled , the dancers went back to their dance and the card-players to their cards , and the major addressed himself more assiduously than ever to the pursuit of the widow . `` I am afraid that you find the rooms very hot , major , '' she remarked . `` They are rather hot , '' he answered candidly . `` There is a room here , '' she said , `` where you might be cooler . You might have a cigarette , too . I meant these rooms as smoking-rooms . `` `` Then you must come , too . `` `` No , no , major . You must remember that I am the hostess . `` `` But there is no one to entertain . They are all entertaining each other . You are too unselfish . `` `` But really , major -- - '' '' Sure you are tired out and need a little rest . `` He held the door open so persuasively that she yielded . It was a snug little room , somewhat retired from the bustle , with two or three chintz-covered chairs scattered round it , and a sofa of the same material at one side . The widow sat down at one end of this sofa , and the major perched himself at the other , looking even redder than usual , and puffing out his chest and frowning , as was his custom upon critical occasions . `` Do light a cigarette ? '' said Mrs . Scully . `` But the smell ? `` `` I like it . `` The major extracted one from his flat silver case . His companion rolled a spill and lit it at the gas . `` To one who is as lonely as I am , '' she remarked , `` it Is a pleasure to feel that one has friends near one , and to serve them even in trifles. '' '' Lonely ! '' said the major , shuffling along the sofa , `` I might talk with authority on that point . If I were to turn me toes up to-morrow there 's not a human being would care a thraneen about the mather , unless it were old Von Baumser . `` `` Oh , do n't talk so , '' cried Mrs. Scully , with emotion . `` It is a fact . I 've kicked against me fate at times , though . I 've had fancies of late of something happier and cheerier . They have come on me as I sat over yonder at the window , and , do what I will , I have not been able to git them from me heart . Yit I know how rash I have been to treasure them , for if they fail me I shall feel me loneliness as I niver did before . `` The major paused and cleared his throat huskily , while the widow remained silent , with her head bent and her eyes intent upon the pattern of the carpet . `` These hopes are , '' said the major , in a low voice , leaning forward and taking his companion 's little ring-covered hand in his thick , pudgy fingers , `` that you will have pity upon me ; that you will -- - '' '' Ach , my very goot vriend ! '' cried Von Baumser heartily , suddenly protruding his hairy head into the room and smiling benignantly . `` Go to the divil ! '' roared the major , springing furiously to his feet , while the German 's head disappeared like a Jack-in-the-box . `` Forgive the warmth of me language , '' the veteran continued , apologetically , `` but me feelings overcame me . Will you be mine , Lavinia ? I am a plain ould soldier , and have little to offer you save a faithful heart , and that is yours , and always will be . Will you make the remainder of me life happy by becoming me wife ? '' He endeavoured to pass his arm round her waist , but she sprang up from the sofa and stood upon the rug , facing him with an amused and somewhat triumphant smile upon her buxom features . `` Look here , major , '' she said , `` I am a plain-spoken woman , as my poor Tom that 's dead was a plain-spoken man . Out with it straight , now -- -have you come after me , or have you come after my money ? `` The major was so astonished at this point-blank question , that for a moment he sat speechless upon the sofa . Being a man of ready resource , however , and one who was accustomed to sudden emergencies , he soon recovered himself . `` Yoursilf , of course '' cried he . `` If you had n't a stiver I would do the same . `` `` Take care ! take care ! '' said the lady , with a warning finger uplifted . `` You heard of the breaking of the Agra Bank ? `` `` What of that ? `` `` Every penny that I had in the world was in it . `` This was facer number two for the campaigner . He recovered himself more quickly from this one , however , and inflated his chest with even more than his usual pomposity . `` Lavinia , '' said he , `` you have been straight with me , and , bedad , I 'll be so with you ? When I first thought of you I was down in the world , and , much as I admired you , I own that your money was an inducement as well as yoursilf . I was so placed that it was impossible for me to think of any woman who had not enough to keep up her own end of the game . Since that time I 've done bether . How I got it is neither here nor there , but I have a little nist-egg in the bank and see me way to increasing it . You tell me your money 's gone , and I tell you I 've enough for two ; so say the word , acushla , and it 's done. '' '' What ! without the money ? `` `` Damn the money ? '' exclaimed Major Tobias Clutterbuck , and put his arm for the second time around his companion . This time it remained there . What happened after that is neither my business nor the reader 's . Couples who have left their youth behind them have their own little romance quite as much as their juniors , and it is occasionally the more heartfelt of the two . `` What a naughty boy to swear ! '' exclaimed the widow at last . `` Now I must give you a lecture since I have the chance . `` `` Bless her mischievous eyes ! '' cried the major , with delight in every feature of his face . `` You shall give me as many lectures as you plase . `` `` You must be good , then , Toby , if you are to be my husband . You must not play billiards for money any more . `` `` No billiards ! Why , pool is worth three or four pound a wake to me . `` `` It does n't matter . No billiards and no cards , and no racing and no betting . Toby must be very good and behave as a distinguished soldier should do . `` `` What are you afther at all ? '' the major cried . `` Sure if I am to give up me pool and whist , how is a distinguished soldier , and , above all , a distinguished soldier 's wife , going to live ? `` `` We 'll manage , dear , '' she said , looking roguishly up into his face . `` I told you that my money was all in the Agra Bank that broke . `` `` You did , worse luck ! `` `` But I did n't tell you that I had drawn it all out before it broke , Toby dear . It was too bad to put you to such a trial , was n't it ? but really I could n't resist the temptation . Toby shall have money enough without betting , and he shall settle down and tell his stories , and do what he likes without anything to bother him . `` `` Bless her heart ! '' cried the major fervently ; and the battered old Bohemian , as he stooped over and kissed her , felt a tear spring to his eyes as he knew that he had come into harbour after life 's stormy tossings . `` No billiards or cards for three months , then , '' said the little woman firmly , with her hands round his arm . `` None at all mind ! I am going into Hampshire on a visit to my cousins in the country , and you shall not see me for that time , though you may write . If you can give me your word of honour when I come back that you 've given up your naughty ways , why then -- - '' '' What then ? `` `` Wait till then and you 'll see , '' she said , with a merry laugh . `` No , really , I wo n't stay another moment . Whatever will the guests say ? I must , Toby ; I really must --
