of the prince had not sounded through it from border to border.Great , however , was the excitement through town and district when it was learned that on the third Wednesday in Advent there would be held a passage-at-arms in which five knights of England would hold the lists against all comers . The great concourse of noblemen and famous soldiers , the national character of the contest , and the fact that this was a last trial of arms before what promised to be an arduous and bloody war , all united to make the event one of the most notable and brilliant that Bordeaux had ever seen . On the eve of the contest the peasants flocked in from the whole district of the Medoc , and the fields beyond the walls were whitened with the tents of those who could find no warmer lodging . From the distant camp of Dax , too , and from Blaye , Bourge , Libourne , St. Emilion , Castillon , St. Macaire , Cardillac , Ryons , and all the cluster of flourishing towns which look upon Bordeaux as their mother , there thronged an unceasing stream of horsemen and of footmen , all converging upon the great city . By the morning of the day on which the courses were to be run , not less than eighty people had assembled round the lists and along the low grassy ridge which looks down upon the scene of the encounter.It was , as may well be imagined , no easy matter among so many noted cavaliers to choose out five on either side who should have precedence over their fellows . A score of secondary combats had nearly arisen from the rivalries and bad blood created by the selection , and it was only the influence of the prince and the efforts of the older barons which kept the peace among so many eager and fiery soldiers . Not till the day before the courses were the shields finally hung out for the inspection of the ladies and the heralds , so that all men might know the names of the champions and have the opportunity to prefer any charge against them , should there be stain upon them which should disqualify them from taking part in so noble and honorable a ceremony.Sir Hugh Calverley and Sir Robert Knolles had not yet returned from their raid into the marches of the Navarre , so that the English party were deprived of two of their most famous lances . Yet there remained so many good names that Chandos and Felton , to whom the selection had been referred , had many an earnest consultation , in which every feat of arms and failure or success of each candidate was weighed and balanced against the rival claims of his companions . Lord Audley of Cheshire , the hero of Poictiers , and Loring of Hampshire , who was held to be the second lance in the army , were easily fixed upon . Then , of the younger men , Sir Thomas Percy of Northumberland , Sir Thomas Wake of Yorkshire , and Sir William Beauchamp of Gloucestershire , were finally selected to uphold the honor of England . On the other side were the veteran Captal de Buch and the brawny Olivier de Clisson , with the free companion Sir Perducas d'Albret , the valiant Lord of Mucident , and Sigismond von Altenstadt , of the Teutonic Order . The older soldiers among the English shook their heads as they looked upon the escutcheons of these famous warriors , for they were all men who had spent their lives upon the saddle , and bravery and strength can avail little against experience and wisdom of war . `` By my faith ! Sir John , '' said the prince as he rode through the winding streets on his way to the list , `` I should have been glad to have splintered a lance to-day . You have seen me hold a spear since I had strength to lift one , and should know best whether I do not merit a place among this honorable company . `` `` There is no better seat and no truer lance , sire , '' said Chandos ; `` but , if I may say so without fear of offence , it were not fitting that you should join in this debate . `` `` And why , Sir John ? `` `` Because , sire , it is not for you to take part with Gascons against English , or with English against Gascons , seeing that you are lord of both . We are not too well loved by the Gascons now , and it is but the golden link of your princely coronet which holds us together . If that be snapped I know not what would follow . `` `` Snapped , Sir John ! '' cried the prince , with an angry sparkle in his dark eyes . `` What manner of talk is this ? You speak as though the allegiance of our people were a thing which might be thrown off or on like a falcon 's jessel . `` `` With a sorry hack one uses whip and spur , sire , '' said Chandos ; `` but with a horse of blood and spirit a good cavalier is gentle and soothing , coaxing rather than forcing . These folk are strange people , and you must hold their love , even as you have it now , for you will get from their kindness what all the pennons in your army could not wring from them . `` `` You are over-grave to-day , John , '' the prince answered . `` We may keep such questions for our council-chamber . But how now , my brothers of Spain , and of Majorca , what think you of this challenge ? `` `` I look to see some handsome joisting , '' said Don Pedro , who rode with the King of Majorca upon the right of the prince , while Chandos was on the left . `` By St. James of Compostella ! but these burghers would bear some taxing . See to the broadcloth and velvet that the rogues bear upon their backs ! By my troth ! if they were my subjects they would be glad enough to wear falding and leather ere I had done with them . But mayhap it is best to let the wool grow long ere you clip it . `` `` It is our pride , '' the prince answered coldly , `` that we rule over freemen and not slaves . `` `` Every man to his own humor , '' said Pedro carelessly . `` Carajo ! there is a sweet face at yonder window ! Don Fernando , I pray you to mark the house , and to have the maid brought to us at the abbey . `` `` Nay , brother , nay ! '' cried the prince impatiently . `` I have had occasion to tell you more than once that things are not ordered in this way in Aquitaine . `` `` A thousand pardons , dear friend , '' the Spaniard answered quickly , for a flush of anger had sprung to the dark cheek of the English prince . `` You make my exile so like a home that I forget at times that I am not in very truth back in Castile . Every land hath indeed its ways and manners ; but I promise you , Edward , that when you are my guest in Toledo or Madrid you shall not yearn in vain for any commoner 's daughter on whom you may deign to cast your eye . `` `` Your talk , sire , '' said the prince still more coldly , `` is not such as I love to hear from your lips . I have no taste for such amours as you speak of , and I have sworn that my name shall be coupled with that of no woman save my ever dear wife . `` `` Ever the mirror of true chivalry ! '' exclaimed Pedro , while James of Majorca , frightened at the stern countenance of their all-powerful protector , plucked hard at the mantle of his brother exile . `` Have a care , cousin , '' he whispered ; `` for the sake of the Virgin have a care , for you have angered him. '' '' Pshaw ! fear not , '' the other answered in the same low tone . `` If I miss one stoop I will strike him on the next . Mark me else . Fair cousin , '' he continued , turning to the prince , `` these be rare men-at-arms and lusty bowmen . It would be hard indeed to match them . `` `` They have journeyed far , sire , but they have never yet found their match . `` `` Nor ever will , I doubt not . I feel myself to be back upon my throne when I look at them . But tell me , dear coz , what shall we do next , when we have driven this bastard Henry from the kingdom which he hath filched ? `` `` We shall then compel the King of Aragon to place our good friend and brother James of Majorca upon the throne . `` `` Noble and generous prince ! '' cried the little monarch . `` That done , '' said King Pedro , glancing out of the corners of his eyes at the young conqueror , `` we shall unite the forces of England , of Aquitaine , of Spain and of Majorca . It would be shame to us if we did not do some great deed with such forces ready to our hand . `` `` You say truly , brother , '' cried the prince , his eyes kindling at the thought . `` Methinks that we could not do anything more pleasing to Our Lady than to drive the heathen Moors out of the country . `` `` I am with you , Edward , as true as hilt to blade . But , by St. James ! we shall not let these Moors make mock at us from over the sea . We must take ship and thrust them from Africa . `` `` By heaven , yes ! '' cried the prince . `` And it is the dream of my heart that our English pennons shall wave upon the Mount of Olives , and the lions and lilies float over the holy city . `` `` And why not , dear coz ? Your bowmen have cleared a path to Paris , and why not to Jerusalem ? Once there , your arms might rest . `` `` Nay , there is more to be done , '' cried the prince , carried away by the ambitious dream . `` There is still the city of Constantine to be taken , and war to be waged against the Soldan of Damascus . And beyond him again there is tribute to be levied from the Cham of Tartary and from the kingdom of Cathay . Ha ! John , what say you ? Can we not go as far eastward as Richard of the Lion Heart ? `` `` Old John will bide at home , sire , '' said the rugged soldier . `` By my soul ! as long as I am seneschal of Aquitaine I will find enough to do in guarding the marches which you have entrusted to me . It would be a blithe day for the King of France
