'' I asked . `` I can not explain . '' She spoke in a low , eager voice , with a curious lisp in her utterance . `` But for God 's sake do what I ask you . Go back and never set foot upon the moor again . `` `` But I have only just come . `` `` Man , man ! '' she cried . `` Can you not tell when a warning is for your own good ? Go back to London ! Start tonight ! Get away from this place at all costs ! Hush , my brother is coming ! Not a word of what I have said . Would you mind getting that orchid for me among the mare's-tails yonder ? We are very rich in orchids on the moor , though , of course , you are rather late to see the beauties of the place . `` Stapleton had abandoned the chase and came back to us breathing hard and flushed with his exertions . `` Halloa , Beryl ! '' said he , and it seemed to me that the tone of his greeting was not altogether a cordial one . `` Well , Jack , you are very hot . `` `` Yes , I was chasing a Cyclopides . He is very rare and seldom found in the late autumn . What a pity that I should have missed him ! '' He spoke unconcernedly , but his small light eyes glanced incessantly from the girl to me . `` You have introduced yourselves , I can see. '' '' Yes . I was telling Sir Henry that it was rather late for him to see the true beauties of the moor . `` `` Why , who do you think this is ? `` `` I imagine that it must be Sir Henry Baskerville . `` `` No , no , '' said I . `` Only a humble commoner , but his friend . My name is Dr . Watson . `` A flush of vexation passed over her expressive face . `` We have been talking at cross purposes , '' said she . `` Why , you had not very much time for talk , '' her brother remarked with the same questioning eyes . `` I talked as if Dr. Watson were a resident instead of being merely a visitor , '' said she . `` It can not much matter to him whether it is early or late for the orchids . But you will come on , will you not , and see Merripit House ? `` A short walk brought us to it , a bleak moorland house , once the farm of some grazier in the old prosperous days , but now put into repair and turned into a modern dwelling . An orchard surrounded it , but the trees , as is usual upon the moor , were stunted and nipped , and the effect of the whole place was mean and melancholy . We were admitted by a strange , wizened , rusty-coated old manservant , who seemed in keeping with the house . Inside , however , there were large rooms furnished with an elegance in which I seemed to recognize the taste of the lady . As I looked from their windows at the interminable granite-flecked moor rolling unbroken to the farthest horizon I could not but marvel at what could have brought this highly educated man and this beautiful woman to live in such a place . `` Queer spot to choose , is it not ? '' said he as if in answer to my thought . `` And yet we manage to make ourselves fairly happy , do we not , Beryl ? `` `` Quite happy , '' said she , but there was no ring of conviction in her words . `` I had a school , '' said Stapleton . `` It was in the north country . The work to a man of my temperament was mechanical and uninteresting , but the privilege of living with youth , of helping to mould those young minds , and of impressing them with one 's own character and ideals was very dear to me . However , the fates were against us . A serious epidemic broke out in the school and three of the boys died . It never recovered from the blow , and much of my capital was irretrievably swallowed up . And yet , if it were not for the loss of the charming companionship of the boys , I could rejoice over my own misfortune , for , with my strong tastes for botany and zoology , I find an unlimited field of work here , and my sister is as devoted to Nature as I am . All this , Dr. Watson , has been brought upon your head by your expression as you surveyed the moor out of our window . `` `` It certainly did cross my mind that it might be a little dull -- -less for you , perhaps , than for your sister . `` `` No , no , I am never dull , '' said she quickly . `` We have books , we have our studies , and we have interesting neighbours . Dr. Mortimer is a most learned man in his own line . Poor Sir Charles was also an admirable companion . We knew him well and miss him more than I can tell . Do you think that I should intrude if I were to call this afternoon and make the acquaintance of Sir Henry ? `` `` I am sure that he would be delighted . `` `` Then perhaps you would mention that I propose to do so . We may in our humble way do something to make things more easy for him until he becomes accustomed to his new surroundings . Will you come upstairs , Dr. Watson , and inspect my collection of Lepidoptera ? I think it is the most complete one in the south-west of England . By the time that you have looked through them lunch will be almost ready . `` But I was eager to get back to my charge . The melancholy of the moor , the death of the unfortunate pony , the weird sound which had been associated with the grim legend of the Baskervilles , all these things tinged my thoughts with sadness . Then on the top of these more or less vague impressions there had come the definite and distinct warning of Miss Stapleton , delivered with such intense earnestness that I could not doubt that some grave and deep reason lay behind it . I resisted all pressure to stay for lunch , and I set off at once upon my return journey , taking the grass-grown path by which we had come.It seems , however , that there must have been some short cut for those who knew it , for before I had reached the road I was astounded to see Miss Stapleton sitting upon a rock by the side of the track . Her face was beautifully flushed with her exertions and she held her hand to her side . `` I have run all the way in order to cut you off , Dr. Watson , '' said she . `` I had not even time to put on my hat . I must not stop , or my brother may miss me . I wanted to say to you how sorry I am about the stupid mistake I made in thinking that you were Sir Henry . Please forget the words I said , which have no application whatever to you . `` `` But I ca n't forget them , Miss Stapleton , '' said I . `` I am Sir Henry 's friend , and his welfare is a very close concern of mine . Tell me why it was that you were so eager that Sir Henry should return to London . `` `` A woman 's whim , Dr. Watson . When you know me better you will understand that I can not always give reasons for what I say or do . `` `` No , no . I remember the thrill in your voice . I remember the look in your eyes . Please , please , be frank with me , Miss Stapleton , for ever since I have been here I have been conscious of shadows all round me . Life has become like that great Grimpen Mire , with little green patches everywhere into which one may sink and with no guide to point the track . Tell me then what it was that you meant , and I will promise to convey your warning to Sir Henry . `` An expression of irresolution passed for an instant over her face , but her eyes had hardened again when she answered me . `` You make too much of it , Dr. Watson , '' said she . `` My brother and I were very much shocked by the death of Sir Charles . We knew him very intimately , for his favourite walk was over the moor to our house . He was deeply impressed with the curse which hung over the family , and when this tragedy came I naturally felt that there must be some grounds for the fears which he had expressed . I was distressed therefore when another member of the family came down to live here , and I felt that he should be warned of the danger which he will run . That was all which I intended to convey . `` But what is the danger ? `` `` You know the story of the hound ? `` `` I do not believe in such nonsense . `` `` But I do . If you have any influence with Sir Henry , take him away from a place which has always been fatal to his family . The world is wide . Why should he wish to live at the place of danger ? `` `` Because it is the place of danger . That is Sir Henry 's nature . I fear that unless you can give me some more definite information than this it would be impossible to get him to move . `` `` I can not say anything definite , for I do not know anything definite . `` `` I would ask you one more question , Miss Stapleton . If you meant no more than this when you first spoke to me , why should you not wish your brother to overhear what you said ? There is nothing to which he , or anyone else , could object . `` `` My brother is very anxious to have the Hall inhabited , for he thinks it is for the good of the poor folk upon the moor . He would be very angry if he knew that I have said anything which might induce Sir Henry to go away . But I have done my duty now and I will say no more . I must go back , or he will miss me and suspect that I have seen you . Good-bye ! '' She turned and had disappeared in a few minutes among the scattered boulders , while I , with my soul full of vague fears , pursued my way to Baskerville Hall.From this point onward I will follow the course of events by transcribing my own letters to Mr. Sherlock Holmes which lie before me on the table .
