there was any record of where he had hidden our jewels . There was not a line , however : so I came away , bitter and savage as a man could be . Before I left I bethought me that if I ever met my Sikh friends again it would be a satisfaction to know that I had left some mark of our hatred : so I scrawled down the sign of the four of us , as it had been on the chart , and I pinned it on his bosom . It was too much that he should be taken to the grave without some token from the men whom he had robbed and befooled . `` We earned a living at this time by my exhibiting poor Tonga at fairs and other such places as the black cannibal . He would eat raw meat and dance his war-dance : so we always had a hatful of pennies after a day 's work . I still heard all the news from Pondicherry Lodge , and for some years there was no news to hear , except that they were hunting for the treasure . At last , however , came what we had waited for so long . The treasure had been found . It was up at the top of the house , in Mr. Bartholomew Sholto 's chemical laboratory . I came at once and had a look at the place , but I could not see how with my wooden leg I was to make my way up to it . I learned , however , about a trap-door in the roof , and also about Mr. Sholto 's supper-hour . It seemed to me that I could manage the thing easily through Tonga . I brought him out with me with a long rope wound round his waist . He could climb like a cat , and he soon made his way through the roof , but , as ill luck would have it , Bartholomew Sholto was still in the room , to his cost . Tonga thought he had done something very clever in killing him , for when I came up by the rope I found him strutting about as proud as a peacock . Very much surprised was he when I made at him with the rope 's end and cursed him for a little blood-thirsty imp . I took the treasure-box and let it down , and then slid down myself , having first left the sign of the four upon the table , to show that the jewels had come back at last to those who had most right to them . Tonga then pulled up the rope , closed the window , and made off the way that he had come . `` I do n't know that I have anything else to tell you . I had heard a waterman speak of the speed of Smith 's launch the Aurora , so I thought she would be a handy craft for our escape . I engaged with old Smith , and was to give him a big sum if he got us safe to our ship . He knew , no doubt , that there was some screw loose , but he was not in our secrets . All this is the truth , and if I tell it to you , gentlemen , it is not to amuse you , -- -for you have not done me a very good turn , -- -but it is because I believe the best defence I can make is just to hold back nothing , but let all the world know how badly I have myself been served by Major Sholto , and how innocent I am of the death of his son . `` `` A very remarkable account , '' said Sherlock Holmes . `` A fitting wind-up to an extremely interesting case . There is nothing at all new to me in the latter part of your narrative , except that you brought your own rope . That I did not know . By the way , I had hoped that Tonga had lost all his darts ; yet he managed to shoot one at us in the boat . `` `` He had lost them all , sir , except the one which was in his blow-pipe at the time . `` `` Ah , of course , '' said Holmes . `` I had not thought of that . `` `` Is there any other point which you would like to ask about ? '' asked the convict , affably . `` I think not , thank you , '' my companion answered . `` Well , Holmes , '' said Athelney Jones , `` You are a man to be humored , and we all know that you are a connoisseur of crime , but duty is duty , and I have gone rather far in doing what you and your friend asked me . I shall feel more at ease when we have our story-teller here safe under lock and key . The cab still waits , and there are two inspectors down-stairs . I am much obliged to you both for your assistance . Of course you will be wanted at the trial . Good-night to you . `` `` Good-night , gentlemen both , '' said Jonathan Small . `` You first , Small , '' remarked the wary Jones as they left the room . `` I 'll take particular care that you do n't club me with your wooden leg , whatever you may have done to the gentleman at the Andaman Isles . `` `` Well , and there is the end of our little drama , '' I remarked , after we had set some time smoking in silence . `` I fear that it may be the last investigation in which I shall have the chance of studying your methods . Miss Morstan has done me the honor to accept me as a husband in prospective . `` He gave a most dismal groan . `` I feared as much , '' said he . `` I really can not congratulate you . `` I was a little hurt . `` Have you any reason to be dissatisfied with my choice ? '' I asked . `` Not at all . I think she is one of the most charming young ladies I ever met , and might have been most useful in such work as we have been doing . She had a decided genius that way : witness the way in which she preserved that Agra plan from all the other papers of her father . But love is an emotional thing , and whatever is emotional is opposed to that true cold reason which I place above all things . I should never marry myself , lest I bias my judgment . `` `` I trust , '' said I , laughing , `` that my judgment may survive the ordeal . But you look weary . `` `` Yes , the reaction is already upon me . I shall be as limp as a rag for a week . `` `` Strange , '' said I , `` how terms of what in another man I should call laziness alternate with your fits of splendid energy and vigor . `` `` Yes , '' he answered , `` there are in me the makings of a very fine loafer and also of a pretty spry sort of fellow . I often think of those lines of old Goethe , -- -Schade dass die Natur nur EINEN Mensch aus Dir schuf , Denn zum wuerdigen Mann war und zum Schelmen der Stoff . `` By the way , a propos of this Norwood business , you see that they had , as I surmised , a confederate in the house , who could be none other than Lal Rao , the butler : so Jones actually has the undivided honor of having caught one fish in his great haul . `` `` The division seems rather unfair , '' I remarked . `` You have done all the work in this business . I get a wife out of it , Jones gets the credit , pray what remains for you ? `` `` For me , '' said Sherlock Holmes , `` there still remains the cocaine-bottle . '' And he stretched his long white hand up for it .
