There is not one of them would dare to set foot within the avenue gates , '' she said . `` Besides , John , the keys are kept by the house-agent at Wigtown . Were they ever so curious , none of our people could find their way in . `` When I reflected upon the massive door and ponderous shutters which guarded the lower storey of Cloomber , I could not but admit the force of my sister 's objection . The untimely visitor must either have used considerable violence in order to force his way in , or he must have obtained possession of the keys.Piqued by the little mystery , I pulled for the beach , with the determination to see for myself who the intruder might be , and what were his intentions . Leaving my sister at Branksome , and summoning Seth Jamieson , an old man-o'-war's-man and one of the stoutest of the fishermen , I set off across the moor with him through the gathering darkness . `` It hasna a guid name after dark , yon hoose , '' remarked my companion , slackening his pace perceptibly as I explained to him the nature of our errand . `` It 's no for naething that him wha owns it wunna gang within a Scotch mile o't . `` `` Well , Seth , there is some one who has no fears about going into it , '' said I , pointing to the great , white building which flickered up in front of us through the gloom.The light which I had observed from the sea was moving backwards and forward past the lower floor windows , the shutters of which had been removed . I could now see that a second fainter light followed a few paces behind the other . Evidently two individuals , the one with a lamp and the other with a candle or rushlight , were making a careful examination of the building . `` Let ilka man blaw his ain parritch , '' said Seth Jamieson doggedly , coming to a dead stop . `` What is it tae us if a wraith or a bogle minds tae tak ' a fancy tae Cloomber ? It 's no canny tae meddle wi ' such things . `` `` Why , man , '' I cried , `` you do n't suppose a wraith came here in a gig ? What are those lights away yonder by the avenue gates ? `` `` The lamps o ' a gig , sure enough ! '' exclaimed my companion in a less lugubrious voice . `` Let 's steer for it , Master West , and speer where she hails frae . `` By this time night had closed in save for a single long , narrow slit in the westward . Stumbling across the moor together , we made our way into the Wigtown Road , at the point where the high stone pillars mark the entrance to the Cloomber avenue . A tall dog-cart stood in front of the gateway , the horse browsing upon the thin border of grass which skirted the road . `` It 's a ' richt ! '' said Jamieson , taking a close look at the deserted vehicle . `` I ken it weel . It belongs tae Maister McNeil , the factor body frae Wigtown -- -him wha keeps the keys . `` `` Then we may as well have speech with him now that we are here , '' I answered . `` They are coming down , if I am not mistaken . `` As I spoke we heard the slam of the heavy door and within a few minutes two figures , the one tall and angular , the other short and thick came towards us through the darkness . They were talking so earnestly that they did not observe us until they had passed through the avenue gate . `` Good evening , Mr. McNeil , '' said I , stepping forward and addressing the Wigtown factor , with whom I had some slight acquaintance.The smaller of the two turned his face towards me as I spoke , and showed me that I was not mistaken in his identity , but his taller companion sprang back and showed every sign of violent agitation . `` What is this , McNeil ? '' I heard him say , in a gasping , choking voice . `` Is this your promise ? What is the meaning of it ? `` `` Do n't be alarmed , General ! Do n't be alarmed ! '' said the little fat factor in a soothing fashion , as one might speak to a frightened child . `` This is young Mr. Fothergill West , of Branksome , though what brings him up here tonight is more than I can understand . However , as you are to be neighbours , I ca n't do better than take the opportunity to introduce you to each other . Mr. West , this is General Heatherstone , who is about to take a lease of Cloomber Hall . `` I held out my hand to the tall man , who took it in a hesitating , half-reluctant fashion . `` I came up , '' I explained , `` because I saw your lights in the windows , and I thought that something might be wrong . I am very glad I did so , since it has given me the chance of making the general 's acquaintance . `` Whilst I was talking , I was conscious that the new tenant of Cloomber Hall was peering at me very closely through the darkness . As I concluded , he stretched out a long , tremulous arm , and turned the gig-lamp in such a way as to throw a flood of light upon my face . `` Good Heavens , McNeil ! '' he cried , in the same quivering voice as before , `` the fellow 's as brown as chocolate . He 's not an Englishman . You 're not an Englishman -- -you , sir ? `` `` I 'm a Scotchman , born and bred , '' said I , with an inclination to laugh , which was only checked by my new acquaintance 's obvious terror . `` A Scotchman , eh ? '' said he , with a sigh of relief . `` It 's all one nowadays . You must excuse me , Mr. -- -Mr. West . I 'm nervous , infernally nervous . Come along , McNeil , we must be back in Wigtown in less than an hour . Good-night , gentlemen , good-night ! `` The two clambered into their places ; the factor cracked his whip , and the high dog-cart clattered away through the darkness , casting a brilliant tunnel of yellow light on either side of it , until the rumble of its wheels died away in the distance . `` What do you think of our new neighbour , Jamieson ? '' I asked , after a long silence . `` 'Deed , Mr. West , he seems , as he says himsel ' , to be vera nervous . Maybe his conscience is oot o ' order . `` `` His liver , more likely , '' said I . `` He looks as if he had tried his constitution a bit . But it 's blowing chill , Seth , my lad , and it 's time both of us were indoors . `` I bade my companion good-night , and struck off across the moors for the cheery , ruddy light which marked the parlour windows of Branksome.There was , as may well be imagined , much stir amongst our small community at the news that the Hall was to be inhabited once more , and considerable speculation as to the new tenants , and their object in choosing this particular part of the country for their residence.It speedily became apparent that , whatever their motives might be , they had definitely determined upon a lengthy stay , for relays of plumbers and of joiners came down from Wigtown , and there was hammering and repairing going on from morning till night.It was surprising how quickly the signs of the wind and weather were effaced , until the great , square-set house was all as spick-and-span as though it had been erected yesterday . There were abundant signs that money was no consideration to General Heatherstone , and that it was not on the score of retrenchment that he had taken up his abode among us . `` It may be that he is devoted to study , '' suggested my father , as we discussed the question round the breakfast table . `` Perhaps he has chosen this secluded spot to finish some magnum opus upon which he is engaged . If that is the case I should be happy to let him have the run of my library . `` Esther and I laughed at the grandiloquent manner in which he spoke of the two potato-sacksful of books . `` It may be as you say , '' said I , `` but the general did not strike me during our short interview as being a man who was likely to have any very pronounced literary tastes . If I might hazard a guess , I should say that he is here upon medical advice , in the hope that the complete quiet and fresh air may restore his shattered nervous system . If you had seen how he glared at me , and the twitching of his fingers , you would have thought it needed some restoring . `` `` I do wonder whether he has a wife and a family , '' said my sister . `` Poor souls , how lonely they will be ! Why , excepting ourselves , there is not a family that they could speak to for seven miles and more . `` `` General Heatherstone is a very distinguished soldier , '' remarked my father . `` Why , papa , however came you to know anything about him ? `` `` Ah , my dears , '' said my father , smiling at us over his coffee-cup , `` you were laughing at my library just now , but you see it may be very useful at times . '' As he spoke he took a red-covered volume from a shelf and turned over the pages . `` This is an Indian Army List of three years back , '' he explained , `` and here is the very gentleman we want-'Heatherstone , J . B. , Commander of the Bath , ' my dears , and 'V.C . ' , think of that , 'V.C . ' -- -'formerly colonel in the Indian Infantry , 41st Bengal Foot , but now retired with the rank of major-general . ' In this other column is a record of his services -- -'capture of Ghuznee and defence of Jellalabad , Sobraon 1848 , Indian Mutiny and reduction of Oudh . Five times mentioned in dispatches . ' I think , my dears , that we have cause to be proud of our new neighbour . `` `` It does n't mention there whether he is married or not , I suppose ? '' asked Esther . `` No , '' said my father , wagging his white head with a keen appreciation of his own humour . `` It does n't include that under the heading of 'daring actions ' -- -though it very well might , my dear , it very well might . `` All our doubts , however , upon this head
