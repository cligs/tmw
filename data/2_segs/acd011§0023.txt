step resolutely out , and as he did so the pressure melted away . There was a low murmur of applause . `` He is of stout heart , '' said the voice . `` Can you bear pain ? `` `` As well as another , '' he answered . `` Test him ! `` It was all he could do to keep himself from screaming out , for an agonizing pain shot through his forearm . He nearly fainted at the sudden shock of it ; but he bit his lip and clenched his hands to hide his agony . `` I can take more than that , '' said he.This time there was loud applause . A finer first appearance had never been made in the lodge . Hands clapped him on the back , and the hood was plucked from his head . He stood blinking and smiling amid the congratulations of the brothers . `` One last word , Brother McMurdo , '' said McGinty . `` You have already sworn the oath of secrecy and fidelity , and you are aware that the punishment for any breach of it is instant and inevitable death ? `` `` I am , '' said McMurdo . `` And you accept the rule of the Bodymaster for the time being under all circumstances ? `` `` I do . `` `` Then in the name of Lodge 341 , Vermissa , I welcome you to its privileges and debates . You will put the liquor on the table , Brother Scanlan , and we will drink to our worthy brother . `` McMurdo 's coat had been brought to him ; but before putting it on he examined his right arm , which still smarted heavily . There on the flesh of the forearm was a circle with a triangle within it , deep and red , as the branding iron had left it . One or two of his neighbours pulled up their sleeves and showed their own lodge marks . `` We 've all had it , '' said one ; `` but not all as brave as you over it. '' '' Tut ! It was nothing , '' said he ; but it burned and ached all the same.When the drinks which followed the ceremony of initiation had all been disposed of , the business of the lodge proceeded . McMurdo , accustomed only to the prosaic performances of Chicago , listened with open ears and more surprise than he ventured to show to what followed . `` The first business on the agenda paper , '' said McGinty , `` is to read the following letter from Division Master Windle of Merton County Lodge 249 . He says : '' Dear Sir : '' There is a job to be done on Andrew Rae of Rae & Sturmash , coal owners near this place . You will remember that your lodge owes us a return , having had the service of two brethren in the matter of the patrolman last fall . You will send two good men , they will be taken charge of by Treasurer Higgins of this lodge , whose address you know . He will show them when to act and where . Yours in freedom , '' J.W . WINDLE D.M.A.O.F . `` `` Windle has never refused us when we have had occasion to ask for the loan of a man or two , and it is not for us to refuse him . '' McGinty paused and looked round the room with his dull , malevolent eyes . `` Who will volunteer for the job ? `` Several young fellows held up their hands . The Bodymaster looked at them with an approving smile . `` You 'll do , Tiger Cormac . If you handle it as well as you did the last , you wo n't be wrong . And you , Wilson . `` `` I 've no pistol , '' said the volunteer , a mere boy in his teens . `` It 's your first , is it not ? Well , you have to be blooded some time . It will be a great start for you . As to the pistol , you 'll find it waiting for you , or I 'm mistaken . If you report yourselves on Monday , it will be time enough . You 'll get a great welcome when you return . `` `` Any reward this time ? '' asked Cormac , a thick-set , dark-faced , brutal-looking young man , whose ferocity had earned him the nickname of `` Tiger . `` `` Never mind the reward . You just do it for the honour of the thing . Maybe when it is done there will be a few odd dollars at the bottom of the box . `` `` What has the man done ? '' asked young Wilson . `` Sure , it 's not for the likes of you to ask what the man has done . He has been judged over there . That 's no business of ours . All we have to do is to carry it out for them , same as they would for us . Speaking of that , two brothers from the Merton lodge are coming over to us next week to do some business in this quarter . `` `` Who are they ? '' asked someone . `` Faith , it is wiser not to ask . If you know nothing , you can testify nothing , and no trouble can come of it . But they are men who will make a clean job when they are about it . `` `` And time , too ! '' cried Ted Baldwin . `` Folk are gettin ' out of hand in these parts . It was only last week that three of our men were turned off by Foreman Blaker . It 's been owing him a long time , and he 'll get it full and proper . `` `` Get what ? '' McMurdo whispered to his neighbour . `` The business end of a buckshot cartridge ! '' cried the man with a loud laugh . `` What think you of our ways , Brother ? `` McMurdo 's criminal soul seemed to have already absorbed the spirit of the vile association of which he was now a member . `` I like it well , '' said he . `` 'T is a proper place for a lad of mettle . `` Several of those who sat around heard his words and applauded them . `` What 's that ? '' cried the black-maned Bodymaster from the end of the table . `` 'T is our new brother , sir , who finds our ways to his taste . `` McMurdo rose to his feet for an instant . `` I would say , Eminent Bodymaster , that if a man should be wanted I should take it as an honour to be chosen to help the lodge . `` There was great applause at this . It was felt that a new sun was pushing its rim above the horizon . To some of the elders it seemed that the progress was a little too rapid . `` I would move , '' said the secretary , Harraway , a vulture-faced old graybeard who sat near the chairman , `` that Brother McMurdo should wait until it is the good pleasure of the lodge to employ him . `` `` Sure , that was what I meant ; I 'm in your hands , '' said McMurdo . `` Your time will come , Brother , '' said the chairman . `` We have marked you down as a willing man , and we believe that you will do good work in these parts . There is a small matter to-night in which you may take a hand if it so please you . `` `` I will wait for something that is worth while . `` `` You can come to-night , anyhow , and it will help you to know what we stand for in this community . I will make the announcement later . Meanwhile , '' he glanced at his agenda paper , `` I have one or two more points to bring before the meeting . First of all , I will ask the treasurer as to our bank balance . There is the pension to Jim Carnaway 's widow . He was struck down doing the work of the lodge , and it is for us to see that she is not the loser . `` `` Jim was shot last month when they tried to kill Chester Wilcox of Marley Creek , '' McMurdo 's neighbour informed him . `` The funds are good at the moment , '' said the treasurer , with the bankbook in front of him . `` The firms have been generous of late . Max Linder & Co. paid five hundred to be left alone . Walker Brothers sent in a hundred ; but I took it on myself to return it and ask for five . If I do not hear by Wednesday , their winding gear may get out of order . We had to burn their breaker last year before they became reasonable . Then the West Section Coaling Company has paid its annual contribution . We have enough on hand to meet any obligations . `` `` What about Archie Swindon ? '' asked a brother . `` He has sold out and left the district . The old devil left a note for us to say that he had rather be a free crossing sweeper in New York than a large mine owner under the power of a ring of blackmailers . By Gar ! it was as well that he made a break for it before the note reached us ! I guess he wo n't show his face in this valley again . `` An elderly , clean-shaved man with a kindly face and a good brow rose from the end of the table which faced the chairman . `` Mr. Treasurer , '' he asked , `` may I ask who has bought the property of this man that we have driven out of the district ? `` `` Yes , Brother Morris . It has been bought by the State & Merton County Railroad Company . `` `` And who bought the mines of Todman and of Lee that came into the market in the same way last year ? `` `` The same company , Brother Morris . `` `` And who bought the ironworks of Manson and of Shuman and of Van Deher and of Atwood , which have all been given up of late ? `` `` They were all bought by the West Gilmerton General Mining Company . `` `` I do n't see , Brother Morris , '' said the chairman , `` that it matters to us who buys them , since they ca n't carry them out of the district . `` `` With all respect to you , Eminent Bodymaster , I think it may matter very much to us . This process has been going on now for ten long years . We are gradually driving all the small men out of trade . What is the result ? We find in their places great companies like the Railroad or the General Iron , who have their directors in New York or Philadelphia , and care nothing for our threats . We can take it out of their local bosses ; but it only means that others will be sent in
