. They rapidly and rather clumsily met the situation . The mark was put by Barker 's bloodstained slipper upon the windowsill to suggest how the fugitive got away . They obviously were the two who must have heard the sound of the gun ; so they gave the alarm exactly as they would have done , but a good half hour after the event . `` `` And how do you propose to prove all this ? `` `` Well , if there were an outsider , he may be traced and taken . That would be the most effective of all proofs . But if not -- -well , the resources of science are far from being exhausted . I think that an evening alone in that study would help me much . `` `` An evening alone ! `` `` I propose to go up there presently . I have arranged it with the estimable Ames , who is by no means wholehearted about Barker . I shall sit in that room and see if its atmosphere brings me inspiration . I 'm a believer in the genius loci . You smile , Friend Watson . Well , we shall see . By the way , you have that big umbrella of yours , have you not ? `` `` It is here . `` `` Well , I 'll borrow that if I may . `` `` Certainly -- -but what a wretched weapon ! If there is danger -- - '' '' Nothing serious , my dear Watson , or I should certainly ask for your assistance . But I 'll take the umbrella . At present I am only awaiting the return of our colleagues from Tunbridge Wells , where they are at present engaged in trying for a likely owner to the bicycle . `` It was nightfall before Inspector MacDonald and White Mason came back from their expedition , and they arrived exultant , reporting a great advance in our investigation . `` Man , I 'll admeet that I had my doubts if there was ever an outsider , '' said MacDonald , `` but that 's all past now . We 've had the bicycle identified , and we have a description of our man ; so that 's a long step on our journey . `` `` It sounds to me like the beginning of the end , '' said Holmes . `` I 'm sure I congratulate you both with all my heart . `` `` Well , I started from the fact that Mr. Douglas had seemed disturbed since the day before , when he had been at Tunbridge Wells . It was at Tunbridge Wells then that he had become conscious of some danger . It was clear , therefore , that if a man had come over with a bicycle it was from Tunbridge Wells that he might be expected to have come . We took the bicycle over with us and showed it at the hotels . It was identified at once by the manager of the Eagle Commercial as belonging to a man named Hargrave , who had taken a room there two days before . This bicycle and a small valise were his whole belongings . He had registered his name as coming from London , but had given no address . The valise was London made , and the contents were British ; but the man himself was undoubtedly an American . `` `` Well , well , '' said Holmes gleefully , `` you have indeed done some solid work while I have been sitting spinning theories with my friend ! It 's a lesson in being practical , Mr . Mac . `` `` Ay , it 's just that , Mr. Holmes , '' said the inspector with satisfaction . `` But this may all fit in with your theories , '' I remarked . `` That may or may not be . But let us hear the end , Mr. Mac . Was there nothing to identify this man ? `` `` So little that it was evident that he had carefully guarded himself against identification . There were no papers or letters , and no marking upon the clothes . A cycle map of the county lay on his bedroom table . He had left the hotel after breakfast yesterday morning on his bicycle , and no more was heard of him until our inquiries . `` `` That 's what puzzles me , Mr. Holmes , '' said White Mason . `` If the fellow did not want the hue and cry raised over him , one would imagine that he would have returned and remained at the hotel as an inoffensive tourist . As it is , he must know that he will be reported to the police by the hotel manager and that his disappearance will be connected with the murder . `` `` So one would imagine . Still , he has been justified of his wisdom up to date , at any rate , since he has not been taken . But his description -- -what of that ? `` MacDonald referred to his notebook . `` Here we have it so far as they could give it . They do n't seem to have taken any very particular stock of him ; but still the porter , the clerk , and the chambermaid are all agreed that this about covers the points . He was a man about five foot nine in height , fifty or so years of age , his hair slightly grizzled , a grayish moustache , a curved nose , and a face which all of them described as fierce and forbidding . `` `` Well , bar the expression , that might almost be a description of Douglas himself , '' said Holmes . `` He is just over fifty , with grizzled hair and moustache , and about the same height . Did you get anything else ? `` `` He was dressed in a heavy gray suit with a reefer jacket , and he wore a short yellow overcoat and a soft cap . `` `` What about the shotgun ? `` `` It is less than two feet long . It could very well have fitted into his valise . He could have carried it inside his overcoat without difficulty . `` `` And how do you consider that all this bears upon the general case ? `` `` Well , Mr. Holmes , '' said MacDonald , `` when we have got our man -- -and you may be sure that I had his description on the wires within five minutes of hearing it -- -we shall be better able to judge . But , even as it stands , we have surely gone a long way . We know that an American calling himself Hargrave came to Tunbridge Wells two days ago with bicycle and valise . In the latter was a sawed-off shotgun ; so he came with the deliberate purpose of crime . Yesterday morning he set off for this place on his bicycle , with his gun concealed in his overcoat . No one saw him arrive , so far as we can learn ; but he need not pass through the village to reach the park gates , and there are many cyclists upon the road . Presumably he at once concealed his cycle among the laurels where it was found , and possibly lurked there himself , with his eye on the house , waiting for Mr. Douglas to come out . The shotgun is a strange weapon to use inside a house ; but he had intended to use it outside , and there it has very obvious advantages , as it would be impossible to miss with it , and the sound of shots is so common in an English sporting neighbourhood that no particular notice would be taken . `` `` That is all very clear , '' said Holmes . `` Well , Mr. Douglas did not appear . What was he to do next ? He left his bicycle and approached the house in the twilight . He found the bridge down and no one about . He took his chance , intending , no doubt , to make some excuse if he met anyone . He met no one . He slipped into the first room that he saw , and concealed himself behind the curtain . Thence he could see the drawbridge go up , and he knew that his only escape was through the moat . He waited until quarter-past eleven , when Mr. Douglas upon his usual nightly round came into the room . He shot him and escaped , as arranged . He was aware that the bicycle would be described by the hotel people and be a clue against him ; so he left it there and made his way by some other means to London or to some safe hiding place which he had already arranged . How is that , Mr . Holmes ? `` `` Well , Mr. Mac , it is very good and very clear so far as it goes . That is your end of the story . My end is that the crime was committed half an hour earlier than reported ; that Mrs. Douglas and Barker are both in a conspiracy to conceal something ; that they aided the murderer 's escape -- -or at least that they reached the room before he escaped -- -and that they fabricated evidence of his escape through the window , whereas in all probability they had themselves let him go by lowering the bridge . That 's my reading of the first half . `` The two detectives shook their heads . `` Well , Mr. Holmes , if this is true , we only tumble out of one mystery into another , '' said the London inspector . `` And in some ways a worse one , '' added White Mason . `` The lady has never been in America in all her life . What possible connection could she have with an American assassin which would cause her to shelter him ? `` `` I freely admit the difficulties , '' said Holmes . `` I propose to make a little investigation of my own to-night , and it is just possible that it may contribute something to the common cause . `` `` Can we help you , Mr . Holmes ? `` `` No , no ! Darkness and Dr. Watson 's umbrella -- -my wants are simple . And Ames , the faithful Ames , no doubt he will stretch a point for me . All my lines of thought lead me back invariably to the one basic question -- -why should an athletic man develop his frame upon so unnatural an instrument as a single dumb-bell ? `` It was late that night when Holmes returned from his solitary excursion . We slept in a double-bedded room , which was the best that the little country inn could do for us . I was already asleep when I was partly awakened by his entrance . `` Well , Holmes , '' I murmured , `` have you found anything out ? `` He stood beside me in silence , his candle in his hand . Then the tall , lean figure inclined towards me . `` I say , Watson , '' he whispered , `` would you be afraid to sleep in the same room with a lunatic , a man with softening of the brain , an idiot whose mind has lost its grip ? `` `` Not in the least
