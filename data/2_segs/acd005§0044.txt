we shall have more wind soon . With a breeze we can show our heels to anything in French waters , but a galley or an armed boat would overhaul us now . `` De Catinat , who , though he could speak little English , had learned in America to understand it pretty well , looked anxiously at Amos Green . `` I fear that we shall bring trouble on this good captain , '' said he , `` and that the loss of his cargo and ship may be his reward for having befriended us . Ask him whether he would not prefer to land us on the north bank . With our money we might make our way into the Lowlands . `` Ephraim Savage looked at his passenger with eyes which had lost something of their sternness . `` Young man , '' said he , `` I see that you can understand something of my talk . `` De Catinat nodded . `` I tell you then that I am a bad man to beat . Any man that was ever shipmates with me would tell you as much . I just jam my helm and keep my course as long as God will let me . D 'ye see ? `` De Catinat again nodded , though in truth the seaman 's metaphors left him with but a very general sense of his meaning . `` We 're comin ' abreast of that there town , and in ten minutes we shall know if there is any trouble waiting for us . But I 'll tell you a story as we go that 'll show you what kind o ' man you 've shipped with . It was ten years ago that I speak of , when I was in theSpeedwell , sixty-ton brig , tradin ' betwixt Boston and Jamestown , goin ' south with lumber and skins and fixin 's , d 'ye see , and north again with tobacco and molasses . One night , blowin ' half a gale from the south'ard , we ran on a reef two miles to the east of Cape May , and down we went with a hole in our bottom like as if she 'd been spitted on the steeple o ' one o ' them Honfleur churches . Well , in the morning there I was washin ' about , nigh out of sight of land , clingin ' on to half the foreyard , without a sign either of my mates or of wreckage . I was n't so cold , for it was early fall , and I could get three parts of my body on to the spar , but I was hungry and thirsty and bruised , so I just took in two holes of my waist-belt , and put up a hymn , and had a look round for what I could see . Well , I saw more than I cared for . Within five paces of me there was a great fish , as long pretty nigh as the spar that I was grippin ' . It 's a mighty pleasant thing to have your legs in the water and a beast like that all ready for a nibble at your toes . '' '' Mon Dieu ! `` cried the French soldier . `` And he have not eat you ? `` Ephraim Savage 's little eyes twinkled at the reminiscence . `` I ate him , '' said he. '' What ! '' cried Amos . `` It 's a mortal fact . I 'd a jack-knife in my pocket , Same as this one , and I kicked my legs to keep the brute off , and I whittled away at the spar until I 'd got a good jagged bit off , sharp at each end , same as a nigger told me once down Delaware way . Then I waited for him , and stopped kicking , so he came at me like a hawk on a chick-a-dee . When he turned up his belly I jammed my left hand with the wood right into his great grinnin ' mouth , and I let him have it with my knife between the gills . He tried to break away then , but I held on , d 'ye see , though he took me so deep I thought I 'd never come up again . I was nigh gone when we got to the surface , but he was floatin ' with the white up , and twenty holes in his shirt front . Then I got back to my spar , for we 'd gone a long fifty fathoms under water , and when I reached it I fainted dead away . `` `` And then ? `` `` Well , when I came to , it was calm , and there was the dead shark floatin ' beside me . I paddled my spar over to him and I got loose a few yards of halliard that were hangin ' from one end of it . I made a clove-hitch round his tail , d 'ye see , and got the end of it slung over the spar and fastened , so as I could n't lose him . Then I set to work and I ate him in a week right up to his back fin , and I drank the rain that fell on my coat , and when I was picked up by theGracieof Gloucester , I was that fat that I could scarce climb aboard . That 's what Ephraim Savage means , my lad , when he says that he is a baddish man to beat . `` Whilst the Puritan seaman had been detailing his reminiscence , his eyes had kept wandering from the clouds to the flapping sails and back . Such wind as there was came in little short puffs , and the canvas either drew full or was absolutely slack . The fleecy shreds of cloud above , however , travelled swiftly across the blue sky . It was on these that the captain fixed his gaze , and he watched them like a man who is working out a problem in his mind . They were abreast of Honfleur now , and about half a mile out from it . Several sloops and brigs were lying there in a cluster , and a whole fleet of brown-sailed fishing-boats were tacking slowly in . Yet all was quiet on the curving quay and on the half-moon fort over which floated the white flag with the goldenfleur-de-lis . The port lay on their quarter now and they were drawing away more quickly as the breeze freshened . De Catinat glancing back had almost made up his mind that their fears were quite groundless when they were brought back in an instant and more urgently than ever.Round the corner of the mole a great dark boat had dashed into view , ringed round with foam from her flying prow , and from the ten pairs of oars which swung from either side of her . A dainty white ensign drooped over her stern , and in her bows the sun 's light was caught by a heavy brass carronade . She was packed with men , and the gleam which twinkled every now and again from amongst them told that they were armed to the teeth . The captain brought his glass to bear upon them and whistled . Then he glanced up at the clouds once more . `` Thirty men , '' said he , `` and they go three paces to our two . You , sir , take your blue coat off this deck or you 'll bring trouble upon us . The Lord will look after His own if they 'll only keep from foolishness . Get these hatches off , Tomlinson . So ! Where 's Jim Sturt and Hiram Jefferson ? Let them stand by to clap them on again when I whistle . Starboard ! Starboard ! Keep her as full as she 'll draw . Now , Amos , and you , Tomlinson , come here until I have a word with you . `` The three stood in consultation upon the poop , glancing back at their pursuers . There could be no doubt that the wind was freshening ; it blew briskly in their faces as they looked back , but it was not steady yet , and the boat was rapidly overhauling them . Already they could see the faces of the marines who sat in the stern , and the gleam of the lighted linstock which the gunner held in his hand . '' Hola ! `` cried an officer in excellent English . `` Lay her to or we fire '' '' Who are you , and what do you want ? '' shouted Ephraim Savage , in a voice that might have been heard from the bank . `` We come in the king 's name , and we want a party of Huguenots from Paris who came on board of your vessel at Rouen . `` `` Brace back the foreyard and lay her to , '' shouted the captain . `` Drop a ladder over the side there and look smart ! So ! Now we are ready for them . `` The yard was swung round and the vessel lay quietly rising and falling on the waves . The boat dashed alongside , her brass cannon trained upon the brigantine , and her squad of marines with their fingers upon their triggers ready to open fire . They grinned and shrugged their shoulders when they saw that their sole opponents were three unarmed men upon the poop . The officer , a young active fellow with a bristling moustache , like the whiskers of a cat , was on deck in an instant with his drawn sword in his hand . `` Come up , two of you ! '' he cried . `` You stand here at the head of theladder , sergeant . Throw up a rope and you can fix it to this stanchion.Keep awake down there and be all ready to fire ! You come with me , Corporal Lemoine . Who is captain of this ship ? `` `` I am , sir , '' said Ephraim Savage submissively . `` You have three Huguenots aboard ? '' '' Tut ! tut ! Huguenots , are they ? I thought they were very anxious to get away , but as long as they paid their passage it was no business of mine . An old man , his daughter , and a young fellow about your age in some sort of livery . `` `` In uniform , sir ! The uniform of the king 's guard . Those are the folk I have come for . `` `` And you wish to take them back ? `` `` Most certainly . `` `` Poor folk ! I am sorry for them . `` `` And so am I , but orders are orders and must be done . `` `` Quite so . Well , the old man is in his bunk asleep . The maid is in a cabin below . And the other is sleeping down the hold there where we had to put him , for there is no room elsewhere . `` `` Sleeping , you say ? We had best surprise him . `` `` But think you that you dare do it alone ! He has no arms , it is true , but he is a well-grown young fellow . Will you not have twenty men up from the boat
