trouble . I beg you , sir , to say nothing to the police . `` `` What do you say , Watson ? `` I shrugged my shoulders . `` If he were safely out of the country it would relieve the tax-payer of a burden . `` `` But how about the chance of his holding someone up before he goes ? `` `` He would not do anything so mad , sir . We have provided him with all that he can want . To commit a crime would be to show where he was hiding . `` `` That is true , '' said Sir Henry . `` Well , Barrymore -- - '' '' God bless you , sir , and thank you from my heart ! It would have killed my poor wife had he been taken again . `` `` I guess we are aiding and abetting a felony , Watson ? But , after what we have heard I do n't feel as if I could give the man up , so there is an end of it . All right , Barrymore , you can go . `` With a few broken words of gratitude the man turned , but he hesitated and then came back . `` You 've been so kind to us , sir , that I should like to do the best I can for you in return . I know something , Sir Henry , and perhaps I should have said it before , but it was long after the inquest that I found it out . I 've never breathed a word about it yet to mortal man . It 's about poor Sir Charles 's death . `` The baronet and I were both upon our feet . `` Do you know how he died ? `` `` No , sir , I do n't know that . `` `` What then ? `` `` I know why he was at the gate at that hour . It was to meet a woman . `` `` To meet a woman ! He ? `` `` Yes , sir . `` `` And the woman 's name ? `` `` I ca n't give you the name , sir , but I can give you the initials . Her initials were L. L. '' '' How do you know this , Barrymore ? `` `` Well , Sir Henry , your uncle had a letter that morning . He had usually a great many letters , for he was a public man and well known for his kind heart , so that everyone who was in trouble was glad to turn to him . But that morning , as it chanced , there was only this one letter , so I took the more notice of it . It was from Coombe Tracey , and it was addressed in a woman 's hand. '' '' Well ? `` `` Well , sir , I thought no more of the matter , and never would have done had it not been for my wife . Only a few weeks ago she was cleaning out Sir Charles 's study -- -it had never been touched since his death -- -and she found the ashes of a burned letter in the back of the grate . The greater part of it was charred to pieces , but one little slip , the end of a page , hung together , and the writing could still be read , though it was gray on a black ground . It seemed to us to be a postscript at the end of the letter and it said : 'Please , please , as you are a gentleman , burn this letter , and be at the gate by ten o clock . Beneath it were signed the initials L. L. '' '' Have you got that slip ? `` `` No , sir , it crumbled all to bits after we moved it . `` `` Had Sir Charles received any other letters in the same writing ? `` `` Well , sir , I took no particular notice of his letters . I should not have noticed this one , only it happened to come alone . `` `` And you have no idea who L. L . is ? `` `` No , sir . No more than you have . But I expect if we could lay our hands upon that lady we should know more about Sir Charles 's death . `` `` I can not understand , Barrymore , how you came to conceal this important information . `` `` Well , sir , it was immediately after that our own trouble came to us . And then again , sir , we were both of us very fond of Sir Charles , as we well might be considering all that he has done for us . To rake this up could n't help our poor master , and it 's well to go carefully when there 's a lady in the case . Even the best of us -- - '' '' You thought it might injure his reputation ? `` `` Well , sir , I thought no good could come of it . But now you have been kind to us , and I feel as if it would be treating you unfairly not to tell you all that I know about the matter . `` `` Very good , Barrymore ; you can go . '' When the butler had left us Sir Henry turned to me . `` Well , Watson , what do you think of this new light ? `` `` It seems to leave the darkness rather blacker than before . `` `` So I think . But if we can only trace L. L. it should clear up the whole business . We have gained that much . We know that there is someone who has the facts if we can only find her . What do you think we should do ? `` `` Let Holmes know all about it at once . It will give him the clue for which he has been seeking . I am much mistaken if it does not bring him down . `` I went at once to my room and drew up my report of the morning 's conversation for Holmes . It was evident to me that he had been very busy of late , for the notes which I had from Baker Street were few and short , with no comments upon the information which I had supplied and hardly any reference to my mission . No doubt his blackmailing case is absorbing all his faculties . And yet this new factor must surely arrest his attention and renew his interest . I wish that he were here.October 17th . All day today the rain poured down , rustling on the ivy and dripping from the eaves . I thought of the convict out upon the bleak , cold , shelterless moor . Poor devil ! Whatever his crimes , he has suffered something to atone for them . And then I thought of that other one -- -the face in the cab , the figure against the moon . Was he also out in that deluged -- -the unseen watcher , the man of darkness ? In the evening I put on my waterproof and I walked far upon the sodden moor , full of dark imaginings , the rain beating upon my face and the wind whistling about my ears . God help those who wander into the great mire now , for even the firm uplands are becoming a morass . I found the black tor upon which I had seen the solitary watcher , and from its craggy summit I looked out myself across the melancholy downs . Rain squalls drifted across their russet face , and the heavy , slate-coloured clouds hung low over the landscape , trailing in gray wreaths down the sides of the fantastic hills . In the distant hollow on the left , half hidden by the mist , the two thin towers of Baskerville Hall rose above the trees . They were the only signs of human life which I could see , save only those prehistoric huts which lay thickly upon the slopes of the hills . Nowhere was there any trace of that lonely man whom I had seen on the same spot two nights before.As I walked back I was overtaken by Dr. Mortimer driving in his dog-cart over a rough moorland track which led from the outlying farmhouse of Foulmire . He has been very attentive to us , and hardly a day has passed that he has not called at the Hall to see how we were getting on . He insisted upon my climbing into his dog-cart , and he gave me a lift homeward . I found him much troubled over the disappearance of his little spaniel . It had wandered on to the moor and had never come back . I gave him such consolation as I might , but I thought of the pony on the Grimpen Mire , and I do not fancy that he will see his little dog again . `` By the way , Mortimer , '' said I as we jolted along the rough road , `` I suppose there are few people living within driving distance of this whom you do not know ? `` `` Hardly any , I think . `` `` Can you , then , tell me the name of any woman whose initials are L . L. ? `` He thought for a few minutes . `` No , '' said he . `` There are a few gipsies and labouring folk for whom I ca n't answer , but among the farmers or gentry there is no one whose initials are those . Wait a bit though , '' he added after a pause . `` There is Laura Lyons -- -her initials are L. L. -- -but she lives in Coombe Tracey . `` `` Who is she ? '' I asked . `` She is Frankland 's daughter. '' '' What ! Old Frankland the crank ? '' '' Exactly . She married an artist named Lyons , who came sketching on the moor . He proved to be a blackguard and deserted her . The fault from what I hear may not have been entirely on one side . Her father refused to have anything to do with her because she had married without his consent and perhaps for one or two other reasons as well . So , between the old sinner and the young one the girl has had a pretty bad time . `` `` How does she live ? `` `` I fancy old Frankland allows her a pittance , but it can not be more , for his own affairs are considerably involved . Whatever she may have deserved one could not allow her to go hopelessly to the bad . Her story got about , and several of the people here did something to enable her to earn an honest living . Stapleton did for one , and Sir Charles for another . I gave a trifle myself . It was to set her up in a typewriting business . `` He wanted to know the object of my inquiries , but I managed to satisfy his curiosity without telling him too much , for there is no reason why we should take anyone into our confidence . Tomorrow morning I shall find my way to Coombe Tracey , and if I can see this Mrs. Laura
