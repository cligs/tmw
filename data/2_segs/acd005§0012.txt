father wished me to stay some time in France , for he would not have me grow up a mere trapper and trader . `` `` And how long do you stop in Paris ? '' asked the guardsman . `` Until Ephraim Savage comes for me . `` `` And who is he ? `` `` The master of theGolden Rod . `` `` And that is your ship ? `` `` My father 's ship . She has been to Bristol , is now at Rouen , and then must go to Bristol again . When she comes back once more , Ephraim comes to Paris for me , and it will be time for me to go . `` `` And how like you Paris ? `` The young man smiled . `` They told me ere I came that it was a very lively place , and truly from the little that I have seen this morning , I think that it is the liveliest place that I have seen . `` `` By my faith , '' said De Catinat , `` you came down those stairs in a very lively fashion , four of you together with a Dutch clock as anavant-courier , and a whole train of wood-work at your heels . And you have not seen the city yet ? `` `` Only as I journeyed through it yester-evening on my way to this house . It is a wondrous place , but I was pent in for lack of air as I passed through it . New York is a great city . There are said to be as many as three thousand folk living there , and they say that they could send out four hundred fighting-men , though I can scarce bring myself to believe it . Yet from all parts of the city one may see something of God 's handiwork -- -the trees , the green of the grass , and the shine of the sun upon the bay and the rivers . But here it is stone and wood , and wood and stone , look where you will . In truth , you must be very hardy people to keep your health in such a place . `` `` And to us it is you who seem so hardy , with your life in the forest and on the river , '' cried the young girl . `` And then the wonder that you can find your path through those great wildernesses , where there is naught to guide you . `` `` Well , there again ! I marvel how you can find your way among these thousands of houses . For myself , I trust that it will be a clear night to-night . `` `` And why ? `` `` That I may see the stars . `` `` But you will find no change in them . `` `` That is it . If I can but see the stars , it will be easy for me to know how to walk when I would find this house again . In the daytime I can carry a knife and notch the door-posts as I pass , for it might be hard to pick up one 's trail again , with so many folk ever passing over it . `` De Catinat burst out laughing again . `` By my faith , you will find Paris livelier than ever , '' said he , `` if you blaze your way through on the door-posts as you would on the trees of a forest . But perchance it would be as well that you should have a guide at first ; so , if you have two horses ready in your stables , uncle , our friend and I might shortly ride back to Versailles together , for I have a spell of guard again before many hours are over . Then for some days he might bide with me there , if he will share a soldier 's quarters , and so see more than the Rue St. Martin can offer . How would that suit you , Monsieur Green ? `` `` I should be right glad to come out with you , if we may leave all here in safety . `` `` Oh , fear not for that , '' said the Huguenot . `` The order of the Prince of Conde will be as a shield and a buckler to us for many a day . I will order Pierre to saddle the horses . `` `` And I must use the little time I have , '' said the guardsman , as he turned away to where Adele waited for him in the window.The young American was soon ready for the expedition , but De Catinat lingered until the last possible minute . When at last he was able to tear himself away , he adjusted his cravat , brushed his brilliant coat , and looked very critically over the sombre suit of his companion . `` Where got you those ? '' he asked . `` In New York , ere I left. '' '' Hem ! There is naught amiss with the cloth , and indeed the sombre colour is the mode , but the cut is strange to our eyes . `` `` I only know that I wish that I had my fringed hunting tunic and leggings on once more . `` `` This hat , now . We do not wear our brims flat like that . See if I can not mend it . '' He took the beaver , and looping up one side of the brim , he fastened it with a golden brooch taken from his own shirt front . `` There is a martial cock , '' said he , laughing , `` and would do credit to the King 's Own Musketeers . The black broad-cloth and silk hose will pass , but why have you not a sword at your side ? `` `` I carry a gun when I ride out . '' '' Mon Dieu , you will be laid by the heels as a bandit ! `` `` I have a knife , too . `` `` Worse and worse ! Well , we must dispense with the sword , and with the gun too , I pray ! Let me re-tie your cravat . So ! Now if you are in the mood for a ten-mile gallop , I am at your service . `` They were indeed a singular contrast as they walked their horses together through the narrow and crowded causeways of the Parisian streets . De Catinat , who was the older by five years , with his delicate small-featured face , his sharply trimmed moustache , his small but well-set and dainty figure , and his brilliant dress , looked the very type of the great nation to which he belonged.His companion , however , large-limbed and strong , turning his bold and yet thoughtful face from side to side , and eagerly taking in all the strange , new life amidst which he found himself , was also a type , unfinished , it is true , but bidding fair to be the higher of the two . His close yellow hair , blue eyes , and heavy build showed that it was the blood of his father , rather than that of his mother , which ran in his veins ; and even the sombre coat and swordless belt , if less pleasing to the eye , were true badges of a race which found its fiercest battles and its most glorious victories in bending nature to its will upon the seas and in the waste places of the earth . `` What is yonder great building ? '' he asked , as they emerged into a broader square . `` It is the Louvre , one of the palaces of the king . `` `` And is he there ? `` `` Nay ; he lives at Versailles. '' '' What ! Fancy that a man should have two such houses ! '' '' Two ! He has many more -- -St. Germain , Marly , Fontainebleau , Clugny . `` `` But to what end ? A man can but live at one at a time . `` `` Nay ; he can now come or go as the fancy takes him . `` `` It is a wondrous building . I have seen the Seminary of St. Sulpice at Montreal , and thought that it was the greatest of all houses , and yet what is it beside this ? `` `` You have been to Montreal , then ? You remember the fort ? `` `` Yes , and the Hotel Dieu , and the wooden houses in a row , and eastward the great mill with the wall ; but what do you know of Montreal ? `` `` I have soldiered there , and at Quebec , too . Why , my friend , you are not the only man of the woods in Paris , for I give you my word that I have worn the caribou mocassins , the leather jacket , and the fur cap with the eagle feather for six months at a stretch , and I care not how soon I do it again , '' Amos Green 's eyes shone with delight at finding that his companion and he had so much in common , and he plunged into a series of questions which lasted until they had crossed the river and reached the south-westerly gate of the city . By the moat and walls long lines of men were busy at their drill . `` Who are those , then ? '' he asked , gazing at them with curiosity . `` They are some of the king 's soldiers . `` `` But why so many of them ? Do they await some enemy ? `` `` Nay ; we are at peace with all the world . Worse luck ! `` `` At peace . Why then all these men ? `` `` That they may be ready . `` The young man shook his head in bewilderment . `` They might be as ready in their own homes surely . In our country every man has his musket in his chimney corner , and is ready enough , yet he does not waste his time when all is at peace . `` `` Our king is very great , and he has many enemies . `` `` And who made the enemies ? `` `` Why , the king , to be sure . `` `` Then would it not be better to be without him ? `` The guardsman shrugged his epaulettes in despair . `` We shall both wind up in the Bastille or Vincennes at this rate , '' said he . `` You must know that it is in serving the country that he has made these enemies . It is but five years since he made a peace at Nimeguen , by which he tore away sixteen fortresses from the Spanish Lowlands . Then , also , he had laid his hands upon Strassburg and upon Luxembourg , and has chastised the Genoans , so that there are many who would fall upon him if they thought that he was weak . `` `` And why has he done all this ? `` `` Because he is a great king , and for the glory of France . `` The stranger pondered over this answer for some time as they rode on between the high , thin poplars , which threw bars across the
