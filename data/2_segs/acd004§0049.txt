Even the squires ' table at the Abbey of St. Andrew 's at Bordeaux was on a very sumptuous scale while the prince held his court there . Here first , after the meagre fare of Beaulieu and the stinted board of the Lady Loring , Alleyne learned the lengths to which luxury and refinement might be pushed . Roasted peacocks , with the feathers all carefully replaced , so that the bird lay upon the dish even as it had strutted in life , boars ' heads with the tusks gilded and the mouth lined with silver foil , jellies in the shape of the Twelve Apostles , and a great pasty which formed an exact model of the king 's new castle at Windsor -- -these were a few of the strange dishes which faced him . An archer had brought him a change of clothes from the cog , and he had already , with the elasticity of youth , shaken off the troubles and fatigues of the morning . A page from the inner banqueting-hall had come with word that their master intended to drink wine at the lodgings of the Lord Chandos that night , and that he desired his squires to sleep at the hotel of the `` Half Moon '' on the Rue des Apotres . Thither then they both set out in the twilight after the long course of juggling tricks and glee-singing with which the principal meal was concluded.A thin rain was falling as the two youths , with their cloaks over their heads , made their way on foot through the streets of the old town , leaving their horses in the royal stables . An occasional oil lamp at the corner of a street , or in the portico of some wealthy burgher , threw a faint glimmer over the shining cobblestones , and the varied motley crowd who , in spite of the weather , ebbed and flowed along every highway . In those scattered circles of dim radiance might be seen the whole busy panorama of life in a wealthy and martial city . Here passed the round-faced burgher , swollen with prosperity , his sweeping dark-clothed gaberdine , flat velvet cap , broad leather belt and dangling pouch all speaking of comfort and of wealth . Behind him his serving wench , her blue whimple over her head , and one hand thrust forth to bear the lanthorn which threw a golden bar of light along her master 's path . Behind them a group of swaggering , half-drunken Yorkshire dalesmen , speaking a dialect which their own southland countrymen could scarce comprehend , their jerkins marked with the pelican , which showed that they had come over in the train of the north-country Stapletons . The burgher glanced back at their fierce faces and quickened his step , while the girl pulled her whimple closer round her , for there was a meaning in their wild eyes , as they stared at the purse and the maiden , which men of all tongues could understand . Then came archers of the guard , shrill-voiced women of the camp , English pages with their fair skins and blue wondering eyes , dark-robed friars , lounging men-at-arms , swarthy loud-tongued Gascon serving-men , seamen from the river , rude peasants of the Medoc , and becloaked and befeathered squires of the court , all jostling and pushing in an ever-changing , many-colored stream , while English , French , Welsh , Basque , and the varied dialects of Gascony and Guienne filled the air with their babel . From time to time the throng would be burst asunder and a lady 's horse-litter would trot past towards the abbey , or there would come a knot of torch-bearing archers walking in front of Gascon baron or English knight , as he sought his lodgings after the palace revels . Clatter of hoofs , clinking of weapons , shouts from the drunken brawlers , and high laughter of women , they all rose up , like the mist from a marsh , out of the crowded streets of the dim-lit city.One couple out of the moving throng especially engaged the attention of the two young squires , the more so as they were going in their own direction and immediately in front of them . They consisted of a man and a girl , the former very tall with rounded shoulders , a limp of one foot , and a large flat object covered with dark cloth under his arm . His companion was young and straight , with a quick , elastic step and graceful bearing , though so swathed in a black mantle that little could be seen of her face save a flash of dark eyes and a curve of raven hair . The tall man leaned heavily upon her to take the weight off his tender foot , while he held his burden betwixt himself and the wall , cuddling it jealously to his side , and thrusting forward his young companion to act as a buttress whenever the pressure of the crowd threatened to bear him away . The evident anxiety of the man , the appearance of his attendant , and the joint care with which they defended their concealed possession , excited the interest of the two young Englishmen who walked within hand-touch of them . `` Courage , child ! '' they heard the tall man exclaim in strange hybrid French . `` If we can win another sixty paces we are safe . `` `` Hold it safe , father , '' the other answered , in the same soft , mincing dialect . `` We have no cause for fear . `` `` Verily , they are heathens and barbarians , '' cried the man ; `` mad , howling , drunken barbarians ! Forty more paces , Tita mia , and I swear to the holy Eloi , patron of all learned craftsmen , that I will never set foot over my door again until the whole swarm are safely hived in their camp of Dax , or wherever else they curse with their presence . Twenty more paces , my treasure ! Ah , my God ! how they push and brawl ! Get in their way , Tita mia ! Put your little elbow bravely out ! Set your shoulders squarely against them , girl ! Why should you give way to these mad islanders ? Ah , cospetto ! we are ruined and destroyed ! `` The crowd had thickened in front , so that the lame man and the girl had come to a stand . Several half-drunken English archers , attracted , as the squires had been , by their singular appearance , were facing towards them , and peering at them through the dim light . `` By the three kings ! '' cried one , `` here is an old dotard shrew to have so goodly a crutch ! Use the leg that God hath given you , man , and do not bear so heavily upon the wench . `` `` Twenty devils fly away with him ! '' shouted another . `` What , how , man ! are brave archers to go maidless while an old man uses one as a walking-staff ? `` `` Come with me , my honey-bird ! '' cried a third , plucking at the girl 's mantle . `` Nay , with me , my heart 's desire ! '' said the first . `` By St. George ! our life is short , and we should be merry while we may . May I never see Chester Bridge again , if she is not a right winsome lass ! `` `` What hath the old toad under his arm ? '' cried one of the others . `` He hugs it to him as the devil hugged the pardoner . `` `` Let us see , old bag of bones ; let us see what it is that you have under your arm ! '' They crowded in upon him , while he , ignorant of their language , could but clutch the girl with one hand and the parcel with the other , looking wildly about in search of help . `` Nay , lads , nay ! '' cried Ford , pushing back the nearest archer . `` This is but scurvy conduct . Keep your hands off , or it will be the worse for you . `` `` Keep your tongue still , or it will be the worse for you , '' shouted the most drunken of the archers . `` Who are you to spoil sport ? `` `` A raw squire , new landed , '' said another . `` By St. Thomas of Kent ! we are at the beck of our master , but we are not to be ordered by every babe whose mother hath sent him as far as Aquitaine . `` `` Oh , gentlemen , '' cried the girl in broken French , `` for dear Christ 's sake stand by us , and do not let these terrible men do us an injury . `` `` Have no fears , lady , '' Alleyne answered . `` We shall see that all is well with you . Take your hand from the girl 's wrist , you north-country rogue ! `` `` Hold to her , Wat ! '' said a great black-bearded man-at-arms , whose steel breast-plate glimmered in the dusk . `` Keep your hands from your bodkins , you two , for that was my trade before you were born , and , by God 's soul ! I will drive a handful of steel through you if you move a finger . `` `` Thank God ! '' said Alleyne suddenly , as he spied in the lamp-light a shock of blazing red hair which fringed a steel cap high above the heads of the crowd . `` Here is John , and Aylward , too ! Help us , comrades , for there is wrong being done to this maid and to the old man . `` `` Hola , mon petit , '' said the old bowman , pushing his way through the crowd , with the huge forester at his heels . `` What is all this , then ? By the twang of string ! I think that you will have some work upon your hands if you are to right all the wrongs that you may see upon this side of the water . It is not to be thought that a troop of bowmen , with the wine buzzing in their ears , will be as soft-spoken as so many young clerks in an orchard . When you have been a year with the Company you will think less of such matters . But what is amiss here ? The provost-marshal with his archers is coming this way , and some of you may find yourselves in the stretch-neck , if you take not heed . `` `` Why , it is old Sam Aylward of the White Company ! '' shouted the man-at-arms . `` Why , Samkin , what hath come upon thee ? I can call to mind the day when you were as roaring a blade as ever called himself a free companion . By my soul ! from Limoges to Navarre , who was there who would kiss a wench or cut a throat as readily as bowman Aylward of Hawkwood 's company ? `` `` Like enough , Peter , '' said Aylward , `` and , by my hilt ! I may not have changed so much . But
