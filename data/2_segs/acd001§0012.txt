, in the injured tone of one who suspects that he is being laughed at , `` I can not see , however , what it has to do with the death of Mr. Joseph Stangerson . `` `` Patience , my friend , patience ! You will find in time that it has everything to do with it . I shall now add a little milk to make the mixture palatable , and on presenting it to the dog we find that he laps it up readily enough . `` As he spoke he turned the contents of the wine glass into a saucer and placed it in front of the terrier , who speedily licked it dry . Sherlock Holmes ' earnest demeanour had so far convinced us that we all sat in silence , watching the animal intently , and expecting some startling effect . None such appeared , however . The dog continued to lie stretched upon tho 16 cushion , breathing in a laboured way , but apparently neither the better nor the worse for its draught.Holmes had taken out his watch , and as minute followed minute without result , an expression of the utmost chagrin and disappointment appeared upon his features . He gnawed his lip , drummed his fingers upon the table , and showed every other symptom of acute impatience . So great was his emotion , that I felt sincerely sorry for him , while the two detectives smiled derisively , by no means displeased at this check which he had met . `` It ca n't be a coincidence , '' he cried , at last springing from his chair and pacing wildly up and down the room ; `` it is impossible that it should be a mere coincidence . The very pills which I suspected in the case of Drebber are actually found after the death of Stangerson . And yet they are inert . What can it mean ? Surely my whole chain of reasoning can not have been false . It is impossible ! And yet this wretched dog is none the worse . Ah , I have it ! I have it ! '' With a perfect shriek of delight he rushed to the box , cut the other pill in two , dissolved it , added milk , and presented it to the terrier . The unfortunate creature 's tongue seemed hardly to have been moistened in it before it gave a convulsive shiver in every limb , and lay as rigid and lifeless as if it had been struck by lightning.Sherlock Holmes drew a long breath , and wiped the perspiration from his forehead . `` I should have more faith , '' he said ; `` I ought to know by this time that when a fact appears to be opposed to a long train of deductions , it invariably proves to be capable of bearing some other interpretation . Of the two pills in that box one was of the most deadly poison , and the other was entirely harmless . I ought to have known that before ever I saw the box at all . `` This last statement appeared to me to be so startling , that I could hardly believe that he was in his sober senses . There was the dead dog , however , to prove that his conjecture had been correct . It seemed to me that the mists in my own mind were gradually clearing away , and I began to have a dim , vague perception of the truth . `` All this seems strange to you , '' continued Holmes , `` because you failed at the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single real clue which was presented to you . I had the good fortune to seize upon that , and everything which has occurred since then has served to confirm my original supposition , and , indeed , was the logical sequence of it . Hence things which have perplexed you and made the case more obscure , have served to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions . It is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery . The most commonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it presents no new or special features from which deductions may be drawn . This murder would have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of the victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of thoseoutr√©and sensational accompaniments which have rendered it remarkable . These strange details , far from making the case more difficult , have really had the effect of making it less so. '' Mr . Gregson , who had listened to this address with considerable impatience , could contain himself no longer . `` Look here , Mr. Sherlock Holmes , '' he said , `` we are all ready to acknowledge that you are a smart man , and that you have your own methods of working . We want something more than mere theory and preaching now , though . It is a case of taking the man . I have made my case out , and it seems I was wrong . Young Charpentier could not have been engaged in this second affair . Lestrade went after his man , Stangerson , and it appears that he was wrong too . You have thrown out hints here , and hints there , and seem to know more than we do , but the time has come when we feel that we have a right to ask you straight how much you do know of the business . Can you name the man who did it ? `` `` I can not help feeling that Gregson is right , sir , '' remarked Lestrade . `` We have both tried , and we have both failed . You have remarked more than once since I have been in the room that you had all the evidence which you require . Surely you will not withhold it any longer . `` `` Any delay in arresting the assassin , '' I observed , `` might give him time to perpetrate some fresh atrocity . `` Thus pressed by us all , Holmes showed signs of irresolution . He continued to walk up and down the room with his head sunk on his chest and his brows drawn down , as was his habit when lost in thought . `` There will be no more murders , '' he said at last , stopping abruptly and facing us . `` You can put that consideration out of the question . You have asked me if I know the name of the assassin . I do . The mere knowing of his name is a small thing , however , compared with the power of laying our hands upon him . This I expect very shortly to do . I have good hopes of managing it through my own arrangements ; but it is a thing which needs delicate handling , for we have a shrewd and desperate man to deal with , who is supported , as I have had occasion to prove , by another who is as clever as himself . As long as this man has no idea that anyone can have a clue there is some chance of securing him ; but if he had the slightest suspicion , he would change his name , and vanish in an instant among the four million inhabitants of this great city . Without meaning to hurt either of your feelings , I am bound to say that I consider these men to be more than a match for the official force , and that is why I have not asked your assistance . If I fail I shall , of course , incur all the blame due to this omission ; but that I am prepared for . At present I am ready to promise that the instant that I can communicate with you without endangering my own combinations , I shall do so . `` Gregson and Lestrade seemed to be far from satisfied by this assurance , or by the depreciating allusion to the detective police . The former had flushed up to the roots of his flaxen hair , while the other 's beady eyes glistened with curiosity and resentment . Neither of them had time to speak , however , before there was a tap at the door , and the spokesman of the street Arabs , young Wiggins , introduced his insignificant and unsavoury person . `` Please , sir , '' he said , touching his forelock , `` I have the cab downstairs . `` `` Good boy , '' said Holmes , blandly . `` Why do n't you introduce this pattern at Scotland Yard ? '' he continued , taking a pair of steel handcuffs from a drawer . `` See how beautifully the spring works . They fasten in an instant . `` `` The old pattern is good enough , '' remarked Lestrade , `` if we can only find the man to put them on . `` `` Very good , very good , '' said Holmes , smiling . `` The cabman may as well help me with my boxes . Just ask him to step up , Wiggins . `` I was surprised to find my companion speaking as though he were about to set out on a journey , since he had not said anything to me about it . There was a small portmanteau in the room , and this he pulled out and began to strap . He was busily engaged at it when the cabman entered the room . `` Just give me a help with this buckle , cabman , '' he said , kneeling over his task , and never turning his head.The fellow came forward with a somewhat sullen , defiant air , and put down his hands to assist . At that instant there was a sharp click , the jangling of metal , and Sherlock Holmes sprang to his feet again . `` Gentlemen , '' he cried , with flashing eyes , `` let me introduce you to Mr. Jefferson Hope , the murderer of Enoch Drebber and of Joseph Stangerson . `` The whole thing occurred in a moment -- -so quickly that I had no time to realize it . I have a vivid recollection of that instant , of Holmes ' triumphant expression and the ring of his voice , of the cabman 's dazed , savage face , as he glared at the glittering handcuffs , which had appeared as if by magic upon his wrists . For a second or two we might have been a group of statues . Then , with an inarticulate roar of fury , the prisoner wrenched himself free from Holmes 's grasp , and hurled himself through the window . Woodwork and glass gave way before him ; but before he got quite through , Gregson , Lestrade , and Holmes sprang upon him like so many staghounds . He was dragged back into the room , and then commenced a terrific conflict . So powerful and so fierce was he , that the four of us were shaken off again and again . He appeared to have the convulsive strength of a man in an epileptic fit . His face and hands were terribly mangled by his passage through the glass , but loss of blood had no effect in diminishing his resistance . It was not until Lestrade succeeded in getting his hand inside his neckcloth and half-strangling him that we made him realize that his struggles
