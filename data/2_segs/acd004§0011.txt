What of the shaft ? The shaft was cut in England : A long shaft , a strong shaft , Barbed and trim and true ; So we 'll drink all together To the gray goose feather And the land where the gray goose flew . What of the men ? The men were bred in England : The bowman -- -the yeoman -- - The lads of dale and fell Here 's to you -- -and to you ; To the hearts that are true And the land where the true hearts dwell . `` Well sung , by my hilt ! '' shouted the archer in high delight . `` Many a night have I heard that song , both in the old war-time and after in the days of the White Company , when Black Simon of Norwich would lead the stave , and four hundred of the best bowmen that ever drew string would come roaring in upon the chorus . I have seen old John Hawkwood , the same who has led half the Company into Italy , stand laughing in his beard as he heard it , until his plates rattled again . But to get the full smack of it ye must yourselves be English bowmen , and be far off upon an outland soil . `` Whilst the song had been singing Dame Eliza and the maid had placed a board across two trestles , and had laid upon it the knife , the spoon , the salt , the tranchoir of bread , and finally the smoking dish which held the savory supper . The archer settled himself to it like one who had known what it was to find good food scarce ; but his tongue still went as merrily as his teeth . `` It passes me , '' he cried , `` how all you lusty fellows can bide scratching your backs at home when there are such doings over the seas . Look at me -- -what have I to do ? It is but the eye to the cord , the cord to the shaft , and the shaft to the mark . There is the whole song of it . It is but what you do yourselves for pleasure upon a Sunday evening at the parish village butts . `` `` And the wage ? '' asked a laborer . `` You see what the wage brings , '' he answered . `` I eat of the best , and I drink deep . I treat my friend , and I ask no friend to treat me . I clap a silk gown on my girl 's back . Never a knight 's lady shall be better betrimmed and betrinketed . How of all that , mon garcon ? And how of the heap of trifles that you can see for yourselves in yonder corner ? They are from the South French , every one , upon whom I have been making war . By my hilt ! camarades , I think that I may let my plunder speak for itself . `` `` It seems indeed to be a goodly service , '' said the tooth-drawer . `` Tete bleu ! yes , indeed . Then there is the chance of a ransom . Why , look you , in the affair at Brignais some four years back , when the companies slew James of Bourbon , and put his army to the sword , there was scarce a man of ours who had not count , baron , or knight . Peter Karsdale , who was but a common country lout newly brought over , with the English fleas still hopping under his doublet , laid his great hands upon the Sieur Amaury de Chatonville , who owns half Picardy , and had five thousand crowns out of him , with his horse and harness . 'T is true that a French wench took it all off Peter as quick as the Frenchman paid it ; but what then ? By the twang of string ! it would be a bad thing if money was not made to be spent ; and how better than on woman -- -eh , ma belle ? `` `` It would indeed be a bad thing if we had not our brave archers to bring wealth and kindly customs into the country , '' quoth Dame Eliza , on whom the soldier 's free and open ways had made a deep impression . `` A toi , ma cherie ! '' said he , with his hand over his heart . `` Hola ! there is la petite peeping from behind the door . A toi , aussi , ma petite ! Mon Dieu ! but the lass has a good color ! `` `` There is one thing , fair sir , '' said the Cambridge student in his piping voice , `` which I would fain that you would make more clear . As I understand it , there was peace made at the town of Bretigny some six years back between our most gracious monarch and the King of the French . This being so , it seems most passing strange that you should talk so loudly of war and of companies when there is no quarrel between the French and us . `` `` Meaning that I lie , '' said the archer , laying down his knife . `` May heaven forfend ! '' cried the student hastily. `` Magna est veritas sed rara , which means in the Latin tongue that archers are all honorable men . I come to you seeking knowledge , for it is my trade to learn . `` `` I fear that you are yet a 'prentice to that trade , '' quoth the soldier ; `` for there is no child over the water but could answer what you ask . Know then that though there may be peace between our own provinces and the French , yet within the marches of France there is always war , for the country is much divided against itself , and is furthermore harried by bands of flayers , skinners , Brabacons , tardvenus , and the rest of them . When every man 's grip is on his neighbor 's throat , and every five-sous-piece of a baron is marching with tuck of drum to fight whom he will , it would be a strange thing if five hundred brave English boys could not pick up a living . Now that Sir John Hawkwood hath gone with the East Anglian lads and the Nottingham woodmen into the service of the Marquis of Montferrat to fight against the Lord of Milan , there are but ten score of us left , yet I trust that I may be able to bring some back with me to fill the ranks of the White Company . By the tooth of Peter ! it would be a bad thing if I could not muster many a Hamptonshire man who would be ready to strike in under the red flag of St. George , and the more so if Sir Nigel Loring , of Christchurch , should don hauberk once more and take the lead of us . `` `` Ah , you would indeed be in luck then , '' quoth a woodman ; `` for it is said that , setting aside the prince , and mayhap good old Sir John Chandos , there was not in the whole army a man of such tried courage . `` `` It is sooth , every word of it , '' the archer answered . `` I have seen him with these two eyes in a stricken field , and never did man carry himself better . Mon Dieu ! yes , ye would not credit it to look at him , or to hearken to his soft voice , but from the sailing from Orwell down to the foray to Paris , and that is clear twenty years , there was not a skirmish , onfall , sally , bushment , escalado or battle , but Sir Nigel was in the heart of it . I go now to Christchurch with a letter to him from Sir Claude Latour to ask him if he will take the place of Sir John Hawkwood ; and there is the more chance that he will if I bring one or two likely men at my heels . What say you , woodman : wilt leave the bucks to loose a shaft at a nobler mark ? `` The forester shook his head . `` I have wife and child at Emery Down , '' quoth he ; `` I would not leave them for such a venture . `` `` You , then , young sir ? '' asked the archer . `` Nay , I am a man of peace , '' said Alleyne Edricson . `` Besides , I have other work to do. '' '' Peste ! '' growled the soldier , striking his flagon on the board until the dishes danced again . `` What , in the name of the devil , hath come over the folk ? Why sit ye all moping by the fireside , like crows round a dead horse , when there is man 's work to be done within a few short leagues of ye ? Out upon you all , as a set of laggards and hang-backs ! By my hilt I believe that the men of England are all in France already , and that what is left behind are in sooth the women dressed up in their paltocks and hosen . `` `` Archer , '' quoth Hordle John , `` you have lied more than once and more than twice ; for which , and also because I see much in you to dislike , I am sorely tempted to lay you upon your back . `` `` By my hilt ! then , I have found a man at last ! '' shouted the bowman . `` And , 'fore God , you are a better man than I take you for if you can lay me on my back , mon garcon . I have won the ram more times than there are toes to my feet , and for seven long years I have found no man in the Company who could make my jerkin dusty . `` `` We have had enough bobance and boasting , '' said Hordle John , rising and throwing off his doublet . `` I will show you that there are better men left in England than ever went thieving to France . `` `` Pasques Dieu ! '' cried the archer , loosening his jerkin , and eyeing his foeman over with the keen glance of one who is a judge of manhood . `` I have only once before seen such a body of a man . By your leave , my red-headed friend , I should be right sorry to exchange buffets with you ; and I will allow that there is no man in the Company who would pull against you on a rope ; so let that be a salve to your pride . On the other hand I should judge that you have led a life of ease for some months back , and that my muscle is harder than your own . I am ready to wager upon myself against you if you are not afeard . `` `` Afeard , thou lurden ! '' growled big John . `` I never saw the face yet of the man that I was afeard of . Come out , and we shall see who is
