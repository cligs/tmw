sunlit road . `` There was a great man in Schenectady once , '' said he at last . `` They are simple folk up yonder , and they all had great trust in each other . But after this man came among them they began to miss -- -one a beaver-skin and one a bag of ginseng , and one a belt of wampum , until at last old Pete Hendricks lost his chestnut three-year-old . Then there was a search and a fuss until they found all that had been lost in the stable of the new-comer , so we took him , I and some others , and we hung him up on a tree , without ever thinking what a great man he had been . `` De Catinat shot an angry glance at his companion . `` Your parable , my friend , is scarce polite , '' said he . `` If you and I are to travel in peace you must keep a closer guard upon your tongue . `` `` I would not give you offence , and it may be that I am wrong , '' answered the American , `` but I speak as the matter seems to me , and it is the right of a free man to do that . `` De Catinat 's frown relaxed as the other turned his earnest blue eyes upon him . `` By my soul , where would the court be if every man did that ? '' said he . `` But what in the name of heaven is amiss now ? `` His companion had hurled himself off his horse , and was stooping low over the ground , with his eyes bent upon the dust . Then , with quick , noiseless steps , he zigzagged along the road , ran swiftly across a grassy bank , and stood peering at the gap of a fence , with his nostrils dilated , his eyes shining , and his whole face aglow with eagerness . `` The fellow 's brain is gone , '' muttered De Catinat , as he caught at the bridle of the riderless horse . `` The sight of Paris has shaken his wits . What in the name of the devil ails you , that you should stand glaring there ? `` `` A deer has passed , '' whispered the other , pointing down at the grass . `` Its trail lies along there and into the wood . It could not have been long ago , and there is no slur to the track , so that it was not going fast . Had we but fetched my gun , we might have followed it , and brought the old man back a side of venison . `` `` For God 's sake get on your horse again ! '' cried De Catinat distractedly . `` I fear that some evil will come upon you ere I get you safe to the RueSt . Martin again ! `` `` And what is wrong now ? '' asked Amos Green , swinging himself into the saddle . `` Why , man , these woods are the king 's preserves and you speak as coolly of slaying his deer as though you were on the shores of Michigan ! '' '' Preserves ! They are tame deer ! '' An expression of deep disgust passed over his face , and spurring his horse , he galloped onwards at such a pace that De Catinat , after vainly endeavouring to keep up , had to shriek to him to stop . `` It is not usual in this country to ride so madly along the roads , '' he panted . `` It is a very strange country , '' cried the stranger , in perplexity . `` Maybe it would be easier for me to remember what *is* allowed . It was but this morning that I took my gun to shoot a pigeon that was flying over the roofs in yonder street , and old Pierre caught my arm with a face as though it were the minister that I was aiming at . And then there is that old man -- -why , they will not even let him say his prayers . `` De Catinat laughed . `` You will come to know our ways soon , '' said he . `` This is a crowded land , and if all men rode and shot as they listed , much harm would come from it . But let us talk rather of your own country . You have lived much in the woods from what you tell me . `` `` I was but ten when first I journeyed with my uncle to Sault la Marie , where the three great lakes meet , to trade with the Chippewas and the tribes of the west . `` `` I know not what La Salle or De Frontenac would have said to that . The trade in those parts belongs to France . `` `` We were taken prisoners , and so it was that I came to see Montreal and afterwards Quebec . In the end we were sent back because they did not know what they could do with us . `` `` It was a good journey for a first . `` `` And ever since I have been trading -- -first , on the Kennebec with the Abenaquis , in the great forests of Maine , and with the Micmac fish-eaters over the Penobscot . Then later with the Iroquois , as far west as the country of the Senecas . At Albany and Schenectady we stored our pelts , and so on to New York , where my father shipped them over the sea . `` `` But he could ill spare you surely ? `` `` Very ill . But as he was rich , he thought it best that I should learn some things that are not to be found in the woods . And so he sent me in theGolden Rod , under the care of Ephraim Savage . `` `` Who is also of New York ? `` `` Nay ; he is the first man that ever was born at Boston . `` `` I can not remember the names of all these villages . `` `` And yet there may come a day when their names shall be as well known as that of Paris . `` De Catinat laughed heartily . `` The woods may have given you much , but not the gift of prophecy , my friend . Well , my heart is often over the water even as yours is , and I would ask nothing better than to see the palisades of Point Levi again , even if all the Five Nations were raving upon the other side of them . But now , if you will look there in the gap of the trees , you will see the king 's new palace . `` The two young men pulled up their horses , and looked down at the wide-spreading building in all the beauty of its dazzling whiteness , and at the lovely grounds , dotted with fountain and with statue , and barred with hedge and with walk , stretching away to the dense woods which clustered round them . It amused De Catinat to watch the swift play of wonder and admiration which flashed over his companion 's features . `` Well , what do you think of it ? '' he asked at last . `` I think that God 's best work is in America , and man 's in Europe . `` `` Ay , and in all Europe there is no such palace as that , even as there is no such king as he who dwells within it . `` `` Can I see him , think you ? `` `` Who , the king ? No , no ; I fear that you are scarce made for a court . `` `` Nay , I should show him all honour . `` `` How , then ? What greeting would you give him ? `` `` I would shake him respectfully by the hand , and ask as to his health and that of his family . `` `` On my word , I think that such a greeting might please him more than the bent knee and the rounded back , and yet , I think , my son of the woods , that it were best not to lead you into paths where you would be lost , as would any of the courtiers if you dropped them in the gorge of the Saguenay . Buthola ! what comes here ? It looks like one of the carriages of the court . `` A white cloud of dust , which had rolled towards them down the road , was now so near that the glint of gilding and the red coat of the coachman could be seen breaking out through it . As the two cavaliers reined their horses aside to leave the roadway clear , the coach rumbled heavily past them , drawn by two dapple grays , and the Horsemen caught a glimpse , as it passed , of a beautiful but haughty face which looked out at them . An instant afterwards a sharp cry had caused the driver to pull up his horses , and a white hand beckoned to them through the carriage window . `` It is Madame de Montespan , the proudest woman in France , '' whisperedDe Catinat . `` She would speak with us , so do as I do . `` He touched his horse with the spur , gave agambadewhich took him across to the carriage , and then , sweeping off his hat , he bowed to his horse 's neck ; a salute in which he was imitated , though in a somewhat ungainly fashion , by his companion . `` Ha , captain ! '' said the lady , with no very pleasant face , `` we meet again . `` `` Fortune has ever been good to me , madame . `` `` It was not so this morning . `` `` You say truly . It gave me a hateful duty to perform . `` `` And you performed it in a hateful fashion . `` `` Nay , madame , what could I do more ? `` The lady sneered , and her beautiful face turned as bitter as it could upon occasion . `` You thought that I had no more power with the king . You thought that my day was past . No doubt it seemed to you that you might reap favour with the new by being the first to cast a slight upon the old . `` `` But , madame -- - '' '' You may spare your protestations . I am one who judges by deeds and not by words . Did you , then , think that my charm had so faded , that any beauty which I ever have had is so withered ? `` `` Nay , madame , I were blind to think that . `` `` Blind as a noontide owl , '' said Amos Green with emphasis.Madame de Montespan arched her eyebrows and glanced at her singular admirer . `` Your friend at least speaks that which he really feels , '' said she . `` At four o'clock to-day we shall see whether others are of the same mind ; and if they are , then it may be ill for those who mistook what was but a passing shadow for a lasting
