. `` True as steel . `` `` Then I would have a word with him . '' The American hurried back along the way they had come , while De Catinat stood chafing at this unnecessary delay . It was a full five minutes before his companion joined him , and the fiery blood of the French soldier was hot with impatience and anger . `` I think that perhaps you had best ride into Paris at your leisure , my friend , '' said he . `` If I go upon the king 's service I can not be delayed whenever the whim takes you . `` `` I am sorry , '' answered the other quietly . `` I had something to say to your major , and I thought that maybe I might not see him again . `` `` Well , here are the horses , '' said the guardsman as he pushed open the postern-gate . `` Have you fed an watered them , Jacques ? `` `` Yes , my captain , '' answered the man who stood at their head . `` Boot and saddle , then , friend Green , and we shall not draw rein again until we see the lights of Paris in front of us . `` The soldier-groom peered through the darkness after them with a sardonic smile upon his face . `` You wo n't draw rein , wo n't you ? '' he muttered as he turned away . `` Well , we shall see about that , my captain ; we shall see about that . `` For a mile or more the comrades galloped along , neck to neck and knee to knee . A wind had sprung up from the westward , and the heavens were covered with heavy gray clouds , which drifted swiftly across , a crescent moon peeping fitfully from time to time between the rifts . Even during these moments of brightness the road , shadowed as it was by heavy trees , was very dark , but when the light was shut off it was hard , but for the loom upon either side , to tell where it lay . De Catinat at least found it so , and he peered anxiously over his horse 's ears , and stooped his face to the mane in his efforts to see his way . `` What do you make of the road ? '' he asked at last . `` It looks as if a good many carriage wheels had passed over it to-day . `` `` What ! Mon Dieu ! Do you mean to say that you can see carriage wheels there ? '' '' Certainly . Why not ? `` `` Why , man , I can not see the road at all . `` Amos Green laughed heartily . `` When you have travelled in the woods by night as often as I have , '' said he , `` when to show a light may mean to lose your hair , one comes to learn to use one 's eyes . `` `` Then you had best ride on , and I shall keep just behind you.So ! Hola ! What is the matter now ? `` There had been the sudden sharp snap of something breaking , and theAmerican had reeled for an instant in the saddle . `` It 's one of my stirrup leathers . It has fallen . `` `` Can you find it ? `` `` Yes ; but I can ride as well without it . Let us push on . `` `` Very good . I can just see you now . `` They had galloped for about five minutes in this fashion , De Catinat 's horse 's head within a few feet of the other 's tail , when there was a second snap , and the guardsman rolled out of the saddle on to the ground . He kept his grip of the reins , however , and was up in an instant at his horse 's head , sputtering out oaths as only an angry Frenchman can . `` A thousand thunders of heaven ! '' he cried . `` What was it that happened then ? `` `` Your leather has gone too . `` `` Two stirrup leathers in five minutes ? It is not possible . `` `` It is not possible that it should be chance , '' said the American gravely , swinging himself off his horse . `` Why , what is this ? My other leather is cut , and hangs only by a thread . `` `` And so does mine . I can feel it when I pass my hand along . Have you a tinder-box ? Let us strike a light . `` `` No , no ; the man who is in the dark is in safety . I let the other folk strike lights . We can see all that is needful to us . `` `` My rein is cut also . `` `` And so is mine . `` `` And the girth of my saddle . `` `` It is a wonder that we came so far with whole bones . Now , who has played us this little trick ? `` `` Who could it be but that rogue Jacques ! He has had the horses in his charge . By my faith , he shall know what the strappado means when I see Versailles again . `` `` But why should he do it ? `` `` Ah , he has been set on to it . He has been a tool in the hands of those who wished to hinder our journey . `` `` Very like . But they must have had some reason behind . They knew well that to cut our straps would not prevent us from reaching Paris , since we could ride bareback , or , for that matter , could run it if need be . `` `` They hoped to break our necks . `` `` One neck they might break , but scarce those of two , since the fate of the one would warn the other . `` `` Well , then , what do you think that they meant ? '' cried De Catinat impatiently . `` For heaven 's sake , let us come to some conclusion , for every minute is of importance . `` But the other was not to be hurried out of his cool , methodical fashion of speech and of thought . `` They could not have thought to stop us , '' said he . `` What did they mean , then ? They could only have meant to delay us.And why should they wish to delay us ? What could it matter to them ifwe gave our message an hour or two sooner or an hour or two later ? It could not matter . `` `` For heaven 's sake -- - '' broke in De Catinat impetuously.But Amos Green went on hammering the matter slowly out . `` Why should they wish to delay us , then ? There 's only one reason that I can see . In order to give other folk time to get in front of us and stop us . That is it , captain . I 'd lay you a beaver-skin to a rabbit-pelt that I 'm on the track . There 's been a party of a dozen horsemen along this ground since the dew began to fall . If they were delayed , they would have time to form their plans before we came . `` `` By my faith , you may be right , '' said De Catinat thoughtfully . `` What would you propose ? `` `` That we ride back , and go by some less direct way . `` `` It is impossible . We should have to ride back to Meudon cross-roads , and then it would add ten miles to our journey . `` `` It is better to get there an hour later than not to get there at all. '' '' Pshaw ! we are surely not to be turned from our path by a mere guess . There is the St. Germain cross-road about a mile below . When we reach it we can strike to the right along the south side of the river , and so change our course . `` `` But we may not reach it . `` `` If anyone bars our way we shall know how to treat with them . `` `` You would fight , then ? '' '' Yes. '' '' What ! with a dozen of them ? `` `` A hundred , if we are on the king 's errand . `` Amos Green shrugged his shoulders . `` You are surely not afraid ? `` `` Yes , I am , mighty afraid . Fighting 's good enough when there 's no help for it . But I call it a fool 's plan to ride straight into a trap when you might go round it . `` `` You may do what you like , '' said De Catinat angrily . `` My father was a gentleman , the owner of a thousand arpents of land , and his son is not going to flinch in the king 's service . `` `` My father , '' answered Amos Green , `` was a merchant , the owner of a thousand skunk-skins , and his son knows a fool when he sees one . `` `` You are insolent , sir , '' cried the guardsman . `` We can settle this matter at some more fitting opportunity . At present I continue my mission , and you are very welcome to turn back to Versailles if you are so inclined . '' He raised his hat with punctilious politeness , sprang on to his horse , and rode on down the road.Amos Green hesitated a little , and then mounting , he soon overtook his companion . The latter , however , was still in no very sweet temper , and rode with a rigid neck , without a glance or a word for his comrade . Suddenly his eyes caught something in the gloom which brought a smile back to his face . Away in front of them , between two dark tree clumps , lay a vast number of shimmering , glittering yellow points , as thick as flowers in a garden . They were the lights of Paris. '' See ! '' he cried , pointing . `` There is the city , and close here must be the St. Germain road . We shall take it , so as to avoid any danger . `` `` Very good ! But you should not ride too fast , when your girth may break at any moment . `` `` Nay , come on ; we are close to our journey 's end . The St. Germain road opens just round this corner , and then we shall see our way , for the lights will guide us . `` He cut his horse with his whip , and they galloped together round the curve . Next instant they were both down in one wild heap of tossing heads and struggling hoofs , De Catinat partly covered by his horse , and his comrade hurled twenty paces , where he lay silent and motionless in the centre of the road.Monsieur de Vivonne had laid his ambuscade with discretion . With a closed carriage and a band of chosen ruffians he had left the palace a good half-hour before the
