riderless horse and rode after Sir Nigel to save him . I saw them throng around him , and he is either taken or slain . `` `` Blow the bugles ! '' cried Sir Hugh , with a scowling brow . `` We must back to camp , and ere three days I trust that we may see these Spaniards again . I would fain have ye all in my company . `` `` We are of the White Company , my fair lord , '' said John . `` Nay , the White Company is here disbanded , '' answered Sir Hugh solemnly , looking round him at the lines of silent figures . `` Look to the brave squire , for I fear that he will never see the sun rise again . `` It was a bright July morning four months after that fatal fight in the Spanish barranca . A blue heaven stretched above , a green rolling plain undulated below , intersected with hedge-rows and flecked with grazing sheep . The sun was yet low in the heaven , and the red cows stood in the long shadow of the elms , chewing the cud and gazing with great vacant eyes at two horsemen who were spurring it down the long white road which dipped and curved away back to where the towers and pinnacles beneath the flat-topped hill marked the old town of Winchester.Of the riders one was young , graceful , and fair , clad in plain doublet and hosen of blue Brussels cloth , which served to show his active and well-knit figure . A flat velvet cap was drawn forward to keep the glare from his eyes , and he rode with lips compressed and anxious face , as one who has much care upon his mind . Young as he was , and peaceful as was his dress , the dainty golden spurs which twinkled upon his heels proclaimed his knighthood , while a long seam upon his brow and a scar upon his temple gave a manly grace to his refined and delicate countenance . His comrade was a large , red-headed man upon a great black horse , with a huge canvas bag slung from his saddle-bow , which jingled and clinked with every movement of his steed . His broad , brown face was lighted up by a continual smile , and he looked slowly from side to side with eyes which twinkled and shone with delight . Well might John rejoice , for was he not back in his native Hampshire , had he not Don Diego 's five thousand crowns rasping against his knee , and above all was he not himself squire now to Sir Alleyne Edricson , the young Socman of Minstead lately knighted by the sword of the Black Prince himself , and esteemed by the whole army as one of the most rising of the soldiers of England.For the last stand of the Company had been told throughout Christendom wherever a brave deed of arms was loved , and honors had flowed in upon the few who had survived it . For two months Alleyne had wavered betwixt death and life , with a broken rib and a shattered head ; yet youth and strength and a cleanly life were all upon his side , and he awoke from his long delirium to find that the war was over , that the Spaniards and their allies had been crushed at Navaretta , and that the prince had himself heard the tale of his ride for succor and had come in person to his bedside to touch his shoulder with his sword and to insure that so brave and true a man should die , if he could not live , within the order of chivalry . The instant that he could set foot to ground Alleyne had started in search of his lord , but no word could he hear of him , dead or alive , and he had come home now sad-hearted , in the hope of raising money upon his estates and so starting upon his quest once more . Landing at London , he had hurried on with a mind full of care , for he had heard no word from Hampshire since the short note which had announced his brother 's death . `` By the rood ! '' cried John , looking around him exultantly , `` where have we seen since we left such noble cows , such fleecy sheep , grass so green , or a man so drunk as yonder rogue who lies in the gap of the hedge ? `` `` Ah , John , '' Alleyne answered wearily , `` it is well for you , but I never thought that my home-coming would be so sad a one . My heart is heavy for my dear lord and for Aylward , and I know not how I may break the news to the Lady Mary and to the Lady Maude , if they have not yet had tidings of it . `` John gave a groan which made the horses shy . `` It is indeed a black business , '' said he . `` But be not sad , for I shall give half these crowns to my old mother , and half will I add to the money which you may have , and so we shall buy that yellow cog wherein we sailed to Bordeaux , and in it we shall go forth and seek Sir Nigel . `` Alleyne smiled , but shook his head . `` Were he alive we should have had word of him ere now , '' said he . `` But what is this town before us ? `` `` Why , it is Romsey ! '' cried John . `` See the tower of the old gray church , and the long stretch of the nunnery . But here sits a very holy man , and I shall give him a crown for his prayers . `` Three large stones formed a rough cot by the roadside , and beside it , basking in the sun , sat the hermit , with clay-colored face , dull eyes , and long withered hands . With crossed ankles and sunken head , he sat as though all his life had passed out of him , with the beads slipping slowly through his thin , yellow fingers . Behind him lay the narrow cell , clay-floored and damp , comfortless , profitless and sordid . Beyond it there lay amid the trees the wattle-and-daub hut of a laborer , the door open , and the single room exposed to the view . The man ruddy and yellow-haired , stood leaning upon the spade wherewith he had been at work upon the garden patch . From behind him came the ripple of a happy woman 's laughter , and two young urchins darted forth from the hut , bare-legged and towsy , while the mother , stepping out , laid her hand upon her husband 's arm and watched the gambols of the children . The hermit frowned at the untoward noise which broke upon his prayers , but his brow relaxed as he looked upon the broad silver piece which John held out to him . `` There lies the image of our past and of our future , '' cried Alleyne , as they rode on upon their way . `` Now , which is better , to till God 's earth , to have happy faces round one 's knee , and to love and be loved , or to sit forever moaning over one 's own soul , like a mother over a sick babe ? `` `` I know not about that , '' said John , `` for it casts a great cloud over me when I think of such matters . But I know that my crown was well spent , for the man had the look of a very holy person . As to the other , there was nought holy about him that I could see , and it would be cheaper for me to pray for myself than to give a crown to one who spent his days in digging for lettuces . `` Ere Alleyne could answer there swung round the curve of the road a lady 's carriage drawn by three horses abreast with a postilion upon the outer one . Very fine and rich it was , with beams painted and gilt , wheels and spokes carved in strange figures , and over all an arched cover of red and white tapestry . Beneath its shade there sat a stout and elderly lady in a pink cote-hardie , leaning back among a pile of cushions , and plucking out her eyebrows with a small pair of silver tweezers . None could seem more safe and secure and at her ease than this lady , yet here also was a symbol of human life , for in an instant , even as Alleyne reined aside to let the carriage pass , a wheel flew out from among its fellows , and over it all toppled -- -carving , tapestry and gilt -- -in one wild heap , with the horses plunging , the postilion shouting , and the lady screaming from within . In an instant Alleyne and John were on foot , and had lifted her forth all in a shake with fear , but little the worse for her mischance . `` Now woe worth me ! '' she cried , `` and ill fall on Michael Easover of Romsey ! for I told him that the pin was loose , and yet he must needs gainsay me , like the foolish daffe that he is . `` `` I trust that you have taken no hurt , my fair lady , '' said Alleyne , conducting her to the bank , upon which John had already placed a cushion . `` Nay , I have had no scath , though I have lost my silver tweezers . Now , lack-a-day ! did God ever put breath into such a fool as Michael Easover of Romsey ? But I am much beholden to you , gentle sirs . Soldiers ye are , as one may readily see . I am myself a soldier 's daughter , '' she added , casting a somewhat languishing glance at John , `` and my heart ever goes out to a brave man . `` `` We are indeed fresh from Spain , '' quoth Alleyne . `` From Spain , say you ? Ah ! it was an ill and sorry thing that so many should throw away the lives that Heaven gave them . In sooth , it is bad for those who fall , but worse for those who bide behind . I have but now bid farewell to one who hath lost all in this cruel war . `` `` And how that , lady ? `` `` She is a young damsel of these parts , and she goes now into a nunnery . Alack ! it is not a year since she was the fairest maid from Avon to Itchen , and now it was more than I could abide to wait at Romsey Nunnery to see her put the white veil upon her face , for she was made for a wife and not for the cloister . Did you ever , gentle sir , hear of a body of men called 'The White Company ' over yonder ? `` `` Surely so , '' cried both the comrades . `` Her father was the leader of it , and her lover served under him
