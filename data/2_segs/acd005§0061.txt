a fate had come upon other women as tender as Adele -- -upon other men as loving as he . What hamlet was there in Canada which had not such stories in their record ? A vague horror seized him as he stood there . We know more of the future than we are willing to admit , away down in those dim recesses of the soul where there is no reason , but only instincts and impressions . Now some impending terror cast its cloud over him . The trees around , with their great protruding limbs , were like shadowy demons thrusting out their gaunt arms to seize him . The sweat burst from his forehead , and he leaned heavily upon his musket . `` By Saint Eulalie , '' said Du Lhut , `` for an old soldier you turn very pale , monsieur , at a little bloodshed . `` `` I am not well . I should be glad of a sup from your cognac bottle . `` `` Here it is , comrade , and welcome ! Well , I may as well have this fine scalp that we may have something to show for our walk . '' He held the Indian 's head between his knees , and in an instant , with a sweep of his knife , had torn off the hideous dripping trophy . `` Let us go ! '' cried De Catinat , turning away in disgust . `` Yes , we shall go ! But I shall also have this wampum belt marked with the totem of the Bear . So ! And the gun too . Look at the 'London ' printed upon the lock . Ah , Monsieur Green , Monsieur Green , it is not hard to see where the enemies of France get their arms . `` So at last they turned away , Du Lhut bearing his spoils , leaving the red grinning figure stretched under the silent trees . As they passed on they caught a glimpse of the lad lying doubled up among the bushes where he had fallen . The pioneer walked very swiftly until he came to a little stream which prattled down to the big river . Here he slipped off his boots and leggings , and waded down it with his companions for half a mile or so . `` They will follow our tracks when they find him , '' said he , `` but this will throw them off , for it is only on running water that an Iroquois can find no trace . And now we shall lie in this clump until nightfall , for we are little over a mile from Port Poitou , and it is dangerous to go forward , for the ground becomes more open . `` And so they remained concealed among the alders whilst the shadows turned from short to long , and the white drifting clouds above them were tinged with the pink of the setting sun . Du Lhut coiled himself into a ball with his pipe between his teeth and dropped into a light sleep , pricking up his ears and starting at the slightest sound from the woods around them . The two Americans whispered together for a long time , Ephraim telling some long story about the cruise of the brigIndustry , bound to Jamestown for sugar and molasses , but at last the soothing hum of a gentle breeze through the branches lulled them off also , and they slept . De Catinat alone remained awake , his nerves still in a tingle from that strange sudden shadow which had fallen upon his soul . What could it mean ? Not surely that Adele was in danger ? He had heard of such warnings , but had he not left her in safety behind cannons and stockades ? By the next evening at latest he would see her again . As he lay looking up through the tangle of copper leaves at the sky beyond , his mind drifted like the clouds above him , and he was back once more in the jutting window in the Rue St. Martin , sitting on the broadbancal , with its Spanish leather covering , with the gilt wool-bale creaking outside , and his arm round shrinking , timid Adele , she who had compared herself to a little mouse in an old house , and who yet had courage to stay by his side through all this wild journey . And then again he was back at Versailles . Once more he saw the brown eyes of the king , the fair bold face of De Montespan , the serene features of De Maintenon -- - once more he rode on his midnight mission , was driven by the demon coachman , and sprang with Amos upon the scaffold to rescue the most beautiful woman in France . So clear it was and so vivid that it was with a start that he came suddenly to himself , and found that the night was creeping on in an American forest , and that Du Lhut had roused himself and was ready for a start . `` Have you been awake ? '' asked the pioneer. '' Yes . `` `` Have you heard anything ? `` `` Nothing but the hooting of the owl . `` `` It seemed to me that in my sleep I heard a gunshot in the distance . `` `` In your sleep ? `` `` Yes , I hear as well asleep as awake and remember what I hear . But now you must follow me close , and we shall be in the fort soon . `` `` You have wonderful ears , indeed , '' said De Catinat , as they picked their way through the tangled wood . `` How could you hear that these men were following us to-day ? I could make out no sound when they were within hand-touch of us . `` `` I did not hear them at first . `` `` You saw them ? `` `` No , nor that either . `` `` Then how could you know that they were there ? `` `` I heard a frightened jay flutter among the trees after we were past it . Then ten minutes later I heard the same thing . I knew then that there was some one on our trail , and I listened . '' '' Peste ! you are a woodsman indeed ! `` `` I believe that these woods are swarming with Iroquois , although we have had the good fortune to miss them . So great a chief as Brown Moose would not start on the path with a small following nor for a small object . They must mean mischief upon the Richelieu . You are not sorry now that you did not bring madame ? `` `` I thank God for it ! `` `` The woods will not be safe , I fear , until the partridge berries are out once more . You must stay at Sainte Marie until then , unless the seigneur can spare men to guard you . `` `` I had rather stay there forever than expose my wife to such devils . `` `` Ay , devils they are , if ever devils walked upon earth . You winced , monsieur , when I took Brown Moose 's scalp , but when you have seen as much of the Indians as I have done your heart will be as hardened as mine . And now we are on the very borders of the clearing , and the blockhouse lies yonder among the clump of maples . They do not keep very good watch , for I have been expecting during these last ten minutes to hear thequi vive . You did not come as near to Sainte Marie unchallenged , and yet De Lannes is as old a soldier as La Noue . We can scarce see now , but yonder , near the river , is where he exercises his men . `` `` He does so now , '' said Amos . `` I see a dozen of them drawn up in a line at their drill . `` `` No sentinels , and all the men at drill ! '' cried Du Lhut in contempt . `` It is as you say , however , for I can see them myself with their ranks open , and each as stiff and straight as a pine stump . One would think to see them stand so still that there was not an Indian nearer than Orange . We shall go across to them , and by Saint Anne , I shall tell their commander what I think of his arrangements . `` Du Lhut advanced from the bushes as he spoke , and the four men crossed the open ground in the direction of the line of men who waited silently for them in the dim twilight . They were within fifty paces , and yet none of them had raised hand or voice to challenge their approach . There was something uncanny in the silence , and a change came over Du Lhut 's face as he peered in front of him . He craned his head round and looked up the river . `` My God ! '' he screamed . `` Look at the fort ! '' They had cleared the clump of trees , and the outline of the blockhouse should have shown up in front of them . There was no sign of it . It was gone ! So unexpected was the blow that even De Lhut , hardened from his childhood to every shock and danger , stood shaken and dismayed . Then , with an oath , he ran at the top of his speed towards the line of figures , his companions following at his heels.As they drew nearer they could see through the dusk that it was not indeed a line . A silent and motionless officer stood out some twenty paces in front of his silent and motionless men . Further , they could see that he wore a very high and singular head-dress . They were still rushing forward , breathless with apprehension , when to their horror this head-dress began to lengthen and broaden , and a great bird flapped heavily up and dropped down again on the nearest tree-trunk . Then they knew that their worst fears were true , and that it was the garrison of Poitou which stood before them.They were lashed to low posts with willow withies , some twenty of them , naked all , and twisted and screwed into every strange shape which an agonised body could assume . In front where the buzzard had perched was the gray-headed commandant , with two cinders thrust into his sockets and his flesh hanging from him like a beggar 's rags . Behind was the line of men , each with his legs charred off to the knees , and his body so haggled and scorched and burst that the willow bands alone seemed to hold it together . For a moment the four comrades stared in silent horror at the dreadful group . Then each acted as his nature bade him . De Catinat staggered up against a tree-trunk and leaned his head upon his arm , deadly sick . Du Lhut fell down upon his knees and said something to heaven , with his two clenched hands shaking up at the darkening sky . Ephraim Savage examined the priming of his gun with a tightened lip and a gleaming eye , while Amos Green , without a word ,
