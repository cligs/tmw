it was ever a fair loose and a clear mark with me . The wench must be willing , or the man must be standing up against me , else , by these ten finger bones ! either were safe enough for me . `` A glance at Aylward 's resolute face , and at the huge shoulders of Hordle John , had convinced the archers that there was little to be got by violence . The girl and the old man began to shuffle on in the crowd without their tormentors venturing to stop them . Ford and Alleyne followed slowly behind them , but Aylward caught the latter by the shoulder . `` By my hilt ! camarade , '' said he , `` I hear that you have done great things at the Abbey to-day , but I pray you to have a care , for it was I who brought you into the Company , and it would be a black day for me if aught were to befall you . `` `` Nay , Aylward , I will have a care . `` `` Thrust not forward into danger too much , mon petit . In a little time your wrist will be stronger and your cut more shrewd . There will be some of us at the 'Rose de Guienne ' to-night , which is two doors from the hotel of the 'Half Moon , ' so if you would drain a cup with a few simple archers you will be right welcome . `` Alleyne promised to be there if his duties would allow , and then , slipping through the crowd , he rejoined Ford , who was standing in talk with the two strangers , who had now reached their own doorstep . `` Brave young signor , '' cried the tall man , throwing his arms round Alleyne , `` how can we thank you enough for taking our parts against those horrible drunken barbarians . What should we have done without you ? My Tita would have been dragged away , and my head would have been shivered into a thousand fragments . `` `` Nay , I scarce think that they would have mishandled you so , '' said Alleyne in surprise . `` Ho , ho ! '' cried he with a high crowing laugh , `` it is not the head upon my shoulders that I think of . Cospetto ! no . It is the head under my arm which you have preserved . `` `` Perhaps the signori would deign to come under our roof , father , '' said the maiden . `` If we bide here , who knows that some fresh tumult may not break out . `` `` Well said , Tita ! Well said , my girl ! I pray you , sirs , to honor my unworthy roof so far . A light , Giacomo ! There are five steps up . Now two more . So ! Here we are at last in safety . Corpo di Bacco ! I would not have given ten maravedi for my head when those children of the devil were pushing us against the wall . Tita mia , you have been a brave girl , and it was better that you should be pulled and pushed than that my head should be broken . `` `` Yes indeed , father , '' said she earnestly . `` But those English ! Ach ! Take a Goth , a Hun , and a Vandal , mix them together and add a Barbary rover ; then take this creature and make him drunk -- -and you have an Englishman . My God ! were ever such people upon earth ! What place is free from them ? I hear that they swarm in Italy even as they swarm here . Everywhere you will find them , except in heaven . `` `` Dear father , '' cried Tita , still supporting the angry old man , as he limped up the curved oaken stair . `` You must not forget that these good signori who have preserved us are also English . `` `` Ah , yes . My pardon , sirs ! Come into my rooms here . There are some who might find some pleasure in these paintings , but I learn the art of war is the only art which is held in honor in your island . `` The low-roofed , oak-panelled room into which he conducted them was brilliantly lit by four scented oil lamps . Against the walls , upon the table , on the floor , and in every part of the chamber were great sheets of glass painted in the most brilliant colors . Ford and Edricson gazed around them in amazement , for never had they seen such magnificent works of art . `` You like them then , '' the lame artist cried , in answer to the look of pleasure and of surprise in their faces . `` There are then some of you who have a taste for such trifling . `` `` I could not have believed it , '' exclaimed Alleyne . `` What color ! What outlines ! See to this martyrdom of the holy Stephen , Ford . Could you not yourself pick up one of these stones which lie to the hand of the wicked murtherers ? `` `` And see this stag , Alleyne , with the cross betwixt its horns . By my faith ! I have never seen a better one at the Forest of Bere . `` `` And the green of this grass -- -how bright and clear ! Why all the painting that I have seen is but child 's play beside this . This worthy gentleman must be one of those great painters of whom I have oft heard brother Bartholomew speak in the old days at Beaulieu . `` The dark mobile face of the artist shone with pleasure at the unaffected delight of the two young Englishmen . His daughter had thrown off her mantle and disclosed a face of the finest and most delicate Italian beauty , which soon drew Ford 's eyes from the pictures in front of him . Alleyne , however , continued with little cries of admiration and of wonderment to turn from the walls to the table and yet again to the walls . `` What think you of this , young sir ? '' asked the painter , tearing off the cloth which concealed the flat object which he had borne beneath his arm . It was a leaf-shaped sheet of glass bearing upon it a face with a halo round it , so delicately outlined , and of so perfect a tint , that it might have been indeed a human face which gazed with sad and thoughtful eyes upon the young squire . He clapped his hands , with that thrill of joy which true art will ever give to a true artist . `` It is great ! '' he cried . `` It is wonderful ! But I marvel , sir , that you should have risked a work of such beauty and value by bearing it at night through so unruly a crowd . `` `` I have indeed been rash , '' said the artist . `` Some wine , Tita , from the Florence flask ! Had it not been for you , I tremble to think of what might have come of it . See to the skin tint : it is not to be replaced , for paint as you will , it is not once in a hundred times that it is not either burned too brown in the furnace or else the color will not hold , and you get but a sickly white . There you can see the very veins and the throb of the blood . Yes , diavolo ! if it had broken , my heart would have broken too . It is for the choir window in the church of St. Remi , and we had gone , my little helper and I , to see if it was indeed of the size for the stonework . Night had fallen ere we finished , and what could we do save carry it home as best we might ? But you , young sir , you speak as if you too knew something of the art . `` `` So little that I scarce dare speak of it in your presence , '' Alleyne answered . `` I have been cloister-bred , and it was no very great matter to handle the brush better than my brother novices . `` `` There are pigments , brush , and paper , '' said the old artist . `` I do not give you glass , for that is another matter , and takes much skill in the mixing of colors . Now I pray you to show me a touch of your art . I thank you , Tita ! The Venetian glasses , cara mia , and fill them to the brim . A seat , signor ! `` While Ford , in his English-French , was conversing with Tita in her Italian-French , the old man was carefully examining his precious head to see that no scratch had been left upon its surface . When he glanced up again , Alleyne had , with a few bold strokes of the brush , tinted in a woman 's face and neck upon the white sheet in front of him. '' Diavolo ! '' exclaimed the old artist , standing with his head on one side , `` you have power ; yes , cospetto ! you have power , it is the face of an angel ! `` `` It is the face of the Lady Maude Loring ! '' cried Ford , even more astonished . `` Why , on my faith , it is not unlike her ! '' said Alleyne , in some confusion. '' Ah ! a portrait ! So much the better . Young man , I am Agostino Pisano , the son of Andrea Pisano , and I say again that you have power . Further , I say , that , if you will stay with me , I will teach you all the secrets of the glass-stainers ' mystery : the pigments and their thickening , which will fuse into the glass and which will not , the furnace and the glazing -- -every trick and method you shall know . `` `` I would be right glad to study under such a master , '' said Alleyne ; `` but I am sworn to follow my lord whilst this war lasts. '' '' War ! war ! '' cried the old Italian . `` Ever this talk of war . And the men that you hold to be great -- -what are they ? Have I not heard their names ? Soldiers , butchers , destroyers ! Ah , per Bacco ! we have men in Italy who are in very truth great . You pull down , you despoil ; but they build up , they restore . Ah , if you could but see my own dear Pisa , the Duomo , the cloisters of Campo Santo , the high Campanile , with the mellow throb of her bells upon the warm Italian air ! Those are the works of great men . And I have seen them with my own eyes , these very eyes which look upon you . I have seen Andrea Orcagna , Taddeo Gaddi , Giottino , Stefano , Simone Memmi -- -men whose very colors I am
