Somehow we gathered up a chair upon our way , and bounded on with it towards the street . My mouth was full of his beard , our arms were locked , our bodies intertwined , and that infernal chair radiated its legs all round us . The watchful Austin had thrown open the hall door . We went with a back somersault down the front steps . I have seen the two Macs attempt something of the kind at the halls , but it appears to take some practise to do it without hurting oneself . The chair went to matchwood at the bottom , and we rolled apart into the gutter . He sprang to his feet , waving his fists and wheezing like an asthmatic . `` Had enough ? '' he panted . `` You infernal bully ! '' I cried , as I gathered myself together.Then and there we should have tried the thing out , for he was effervescing with fight , but fortunately I was rescued from an odious situation . A policeman was beside us , his notebook in his hand . `` What 's all this ? You ought to be ashamed '' said the policeman . It was the most rational remark which I had heard in Enmore Park . `` Well , '' he insisted , turning to me , `` what is it , then ? `` `` This man attacked me , '' said I . `` Did you attack him ? '' asked the policeman.The Professor breathed hard and said nothing . `` It 's not the first time , either , '' said the policeman , severely , shaking his head . `` You were in trouble last month for the same thing . You 've blackened this young man 's eye . Do you give him in charge , sir ? `` I relented . `` No , '' said I , `` I do not . `` `` What 's that ? '' said the policeman . `` I was to blame myself . I intruded upon him . He gave me fair warning . `` The policeman snapped up his notebook . `` Do n't let us have any more such goings-on , '' said he . `` Now , then ! Move on , there , move on ! '' This to a butcher 's boy , a maid , and one or two loafers who had collected . He clumped heavily down the street , driving this little flock before him . The Professor looked at me , and there was something humorous at the back of his eyes . `` Come in ! '' said he . `` I 've not done with you yet . `` The speech had a sinister sound , but I followed him none the less into the house . The man-servant , Austin , like a wooden image , closed the door behind us.Hardly was it shut when Mrs . Challenger darted out from the dining-room . The small woman was in a furious temper . She barred her husband 's way like an enraged chicken in front of a bulldog . It was evident that she had seen my exit , but had not observed my return . `` You brute , George ! '' she screamed . `` You 've hurt that nice young man . `` He jerked backwards with his thumb . `` Here he is , safe and sound behind me . `` She was confused , but not unduly so . `` I am so sorry , I did n't see you . `` `` I assure you , madam , that it is all right . `` `` He has marked your poor face ! Oh , George , what a brute you are ! Nothing but scandals from one end of the week to the other . Everyone hating and making fun of you . You 've finished my patience . This ends it . `` `` Dirty linen , '' he rumbled . `` It 's not a secret , '' she cried . `` Do you suppose that the whole street -- -the whole of London , for that matter -- -- -- Get away , Austin , we do n't want you here . Do you suppose they do n't all talk about you ? Where is your dignity ? You , a man who should have been Regius Professor at a great University with a thousand students all revering you . Where is your dignity , George ? `` `` How about yours , my dear ? `` `` You try me too much . A ruffian -- -a common brawling ruffian -- -that 's what you have become . `` `` Be good , Jessie . `` `` A roaring , raging bully ! `` `` That 's done it ! Stool of penance ! '' said he.To my amazement he stooped , picked her up , and placed her sitting upon a high pedestal of black marble in the angle of the hall . It was at least seven feet high , and so thin that she could hardly balance upon it . A more absurd object than she presented cocked up there with her face convulsed with anger , her feet dangling , and her body rigid for fear of an upset , I could not imagine . `` Let me down ! '' she wailed . `` Say 'please . ' '' '' You brute , George ! Let me down this instant ! `` `` Come into the study , Mr . Malone . `` `` Really , sir -- -- -- ! '' said I , looking at the lady . `` Here 's Mr. Malone pleading for you , Jessie . Say 'please , ' and down you come . `` `` Oh , you brute ! Please ! please ! `` He took her down as if she had been a canary . `` You must behave yourself , dear . Mr. Malone is a Pressman . He will have it all in his rag to-morrow , and sell an extra dozen among our neighbors . 'Strange story of high life ' -- -you felt fairly high on that pedestal , did you not ? Then a sub-title , 'Glimpse of a singular menage . ' He 's a foul feeder , is Mr. Malone , a carrion eater , like all of his kind -- -porcus ex grege diaboli -- -a swine from the devil 's herd . That 's it , Malone -- -what ? `` `` You are really intolerable ! '' said I , hotly.He bellowed with laughter . `` We shall have a coalition presently , '' he boomed , looking from his wife to me and puffing out his enormous chest . Then , suddenly altering his tone , `` Excuse this frivolous family badinage , Mr. Malone . I called you back for some more serious purpose than to mix you up with our little domestic pleasantries . Run away , little woman , and do n't fret . '' He placed a huge hand upon each of her shoulders . `` All that you say is perfectly true . I should be a better man if I did what you advise , but I should n't be quite George Edward Challenger . There are plenty of better men , my dear , but only one G. E. C. So make the best of him . '' He suddenly gave her a resounding kiss , which embarrassed me even more than his violence had done . `` Now , Mr. Malone , '' he continued , with a great accession of dignity , `` this way , if YOU please . `` We re-entered the room which we had left so tumultuously ten minutes before . The Professor closed the door carefully behind us , motioned me into an arm-chair , and pushed a cigar-box under my nose . `` Real San Juan Colorado , '' he said . `` Excitable people like you are the better for narcotics . Heavens ! do n't bite it ! Cut -- -and cut with reverence ! Now lean back , and listen attentively to whatever I may care to say to you . If any remark should occur to you , you can reserve it for some more opportune time . `` First of all , as to your return to my house after your most justifiable expulsion '' -- -he protruded his beard , and stared at me as one who challenges and invites contradiction -- - '' after , as I say , your well-merited expulsion . The reason lay in your answer to that most officious policeman , in which I seemed to discern some glimmering of good feeling upon your part -- -more , at any rate , than I am accustomed to associate with your profession . In admitting that the fault of the incident lay with you , you gave some evidence of a certain mental detachment and breadth of view which attracted my favorable notice . The sub-species of the human race to which you unfortunately belong has always been below my mental horizon . Your words brought you suddenly above it . You swam up into my serious notice . For this reason I asked you to return with me , as I was minded to make your further acquaintance . You will kindly deposit your ash in the small Japanese tray on the bamboo table which stands at your left elbow . `` All this he boomed forth like a professor addressing his class . He had swung round his revolving chair so as to face me , and he sat all puffed out like an enormous bull-frog , his head laid back and his eyes half-covered by supercilious lids . Now he suddenly turned himself sideways , and all I could see of him was tangled hair with a red , protruding ear . He was scratching about among the litter of papers upon his desk . He faced me presently with what looked like a very tattered sketch-book in his hand . `` I am going to talk to you about South America , '' said he . `` No comments if you please . First of all , I wish you to understand that nothing I tell you now is to be repeated in any public way unless you have my express permission . That permission will , in all human probability , never be given . Is that clear ? `` `` It is very hard , '' said I . `` Surely a judicious account -- -- -- '' He replaced the notebook upon the table . `` That ends it , '' said he . `` I wish you a very good morning . `` `` No , no ! '' I cried . `` I submit to any conditions . So far as I can see , I have no choice . `` `` None in the world , '' said he . `` Well , then , I promise . `` `` Word of honor ? `` `` Word of honor . `` He looked at me with doubt in his insolent eyes . `` After all , what do I know about your honor ? '' said he . `` Upon my word , sir , '' I cried , angrily , `` you take very great liberties ! I have never been so insulted in my life . `` He seemed more interested than annoyed at my outbreak . `` Round-headed , '' he muttered . `` Brachycephalic , gray-eyed , black-haired , with suggestion of the negroid .
