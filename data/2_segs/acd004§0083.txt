brow resting upon his hands , he thought of his brother , of their quarrel , of the Lady Maude in her bedraggled riding-dress , of the gray old castle , of the proud pale face in the armory , and of the last fiery words with which she had sped him on his way . Then he was but a penniless , monk-bred lad , unknown and unfriended . Now he was himself Socman of Minstead , the head of an old stock , and the lord of an estate which , if reduced from its former size , was still ample to preserve the dignity of his family . Further , he had become a man of experience , was counted brave among brave men , had won the esteem and confidence of her father , and , above all , had been listened to by him when he told him the secret of his love . As to the gaining of knighthood , in such stirring times it was no great matter for a brave squire of gentle birth to aspire to that honor . He would leave his bones among these Spanish ravines , or he would do some deed which would call the eyes of men upon him.Alleyne was still seated on the rock , his griefs and his joys drifting swiftly over his mind like the shadow of clouds upon a sunlit meadow , when of a sudden he became conscious of a low , deep sound which came booming up to him through the fog . Close behind him he could hear the murmur of the bowmen , the occasional bursts of hoarse laughter , and the champing and stamping of their horses . Behind it all , however , came that low-pitched , deep-toned hum , which seemed to come from every quarter and to fill the whole air . In the old monastic days he remembered to have heard such a sound when he had walked out one windy night at Bucklershard , and had listened to the long waves breaking upon the shingly shore . Here , however , was neither wind nor sea , and yet the dull murmur rose ever louder and stronger out of the heart of the rolling sea of vapor . He turned and ran to the camp , shouting an alarm at the top of his voice.It was but a hundred paces , and yet ere he had crossed it every bowman was ready at his horse 's head , and the group of knights were out and listening intently to the ominous sound . `` It is a great body of horse , '' said Sir William Felton , `` and they are riding very swiftly hitherwards . `` `` Yet they must be from the prince 's army , '' remarked Sir Richard Causton , `` for they come from the north . `` `` Nay , '' said the Earl of Angus , `` it is not so certain ; for the peasant with whom we spoke last night said that it was rumored that Don Tello , the Spanish king 's brother , had ridden with six thousand chosen men to beat up the prince 's camp . It may be that on their backward road they have come this way . `` `` By St . Paul ! '' cried Sir Nigel , `` I think that it is even as you say , for that same peasant had a sour face and a shifting eye , as one who bore us little good will . I doubt not that he has brought these cavaliers upon us . `` `` But the mist covers us , '' said Sir Simon Burley . `` We have yet time to ride through the further end of the pass . `` `` Were we a troop of mountain goats we might do so , '' answered Sir William Felton , `` but it is not to be passed by a company of horsemen . If these be indeed Don Tello and his men , then we must bide where we are , and do what we can to make them rue the day that they found us in their path . `` `` Well spoken , William ! '' cried Sir Nigel , in high delight . `` If there be so many as has been said , then there will be much honor to be gained from them and every hope of advancement . But the sound has ceased , and I fear that they have gone some other way . `` `` Or mayhap they have come to the mouth of the gorge , and are marshalling their ranks . Hush and hearken ! for they are no great way from us . `` The Company stood peering into the dense fog-wreath , amidst a silence so profound that the dripping of the water from the rocks and the breathing of the horses grew loud upon the ear . Suddenly from out the sea of mist came the shrill sound of a neigh , followed by a long blast upon a bugle . `` It is a Spanish call , my fair lord , '' said Black Simon . `` It is used by their prickers and huntsmen when the beast hath not fled , but is still in its lair . `` `` By my faith ! '' said Sir Nigel , smiling , `` if they are in a humor for venerie we may promise them some sport ere they sound the mort over us . But there is a hill in the centre of the gorge on which we might take our stand . `` `` I marked it yester-night , '' said Felton , `` and no better spot could be found for our purpose , for it is very steep at the back . It is but a bow-shot to the left , and , indeed , I can see the shadow of it . `` The whole Company , leading their horses , passed across to the small hill which loomed in front of them out of the mist . It was indeed admirably designed for defence , for it sloped down in front , all jagged and boulder-strewn , while it fell away in a sheer cliff of a hundred feet or more . On the summit was a small uneven plateau , with a stretch across of a hundred paces , and a depth of half as much again . `` Unloose the horses ! '' said Sir Nigel . `` We have no space for them , and if we hold our own we shall have horses and to spare when this day 's work is done . Nay , keep yours , my fair sirs , for we may have work for them . Aylward , Johnston , let your men form a harrow on either side of the ridge . Sir Oliver and you , my Lord Angus , I give you the right wing , and the left to you , Sir Simon , and to you , Sir Richard Causton . I and Sir William Felton will hold the centre with our men-at-arms . Now order the ranks , and fling wide the banners , for our souls are God 's and our bodies the king 's , and our swords for Saint George and for England ! `` Sir Nigel had scarcely spoken when the mist seemed to thin in the valley , and to shred away into long ragged clouds which trailed from the edges of the cliffs . The gorge in which they had camped was a mere wedge-shaped cleft among the hills , three-quarters of a mile deep , with the small rugged rising upon which they stood at the further end , and the brown crags walling it in on three sides . As the mist parted , and the sun broke through , it gleamed and shimmered with dazzling brightness upon the armor and headpieces of a vast body of horsemen who stretched across the barranca from one cliff to the other , and extended backwards until their rear guard were far out upon the plain beyond . Line after line , and rank after rank , they choked the neck of the valley with a long vista of tossing pennons , twinkling lances , waving plumes and streaming banderoles , while the curvets and gambades of the chargers lent a constant motion and shimmer to the glittering , many-colored mass . A yell of exultation , and a forest of waving steel through the length and breadth of their column , announced that they could at last see their entrapped enemies , while the swelling notes of a hundred bugles and drums , mixed with the clash of Moorish cymbals , broke forth into a proud peal of martial triumph . Strange it was to these gallant and sparkling cavaliers of Spain to look upon this handful of men upon the hill , the thin lines of bowmen , the knots of knights and men-at-arms with armor rusted and discolored from long service , and to learn that these were indeed the soldiers whose fame and prowess had been the camp-fire talk of every army in Christendom . Very still and silent they stood , leaning upon their bows , while their leaders took counsel together in front of them . No clang of bugle rose from their stern ranks , but in the centre waved the leopards of England , on the right the ensign of their Company with the roses of Loring , and on the left , over three score of Welsh bowmen , there floated the red banner of Merlin with the boars'-heads of the Buttesthorns . Gravely and sedately they stood beneath the morning sun waiting for the onslaught of their foemen . `` By Saint Paul ! '' said Sir Nigel , gazing with puckered eye down the valley , `` there appear to be some very worthy people among them . What is this golden banner which waves upon the left ? `` `` It is the ensign of the Knights of Calatrava , '' answered Felton . `` And the other upon the right ? `` `` It marks the Knights of Santiago , and I see by his flag that their grand-master rides at their head . There too is the banner of Castile amid yonder sparkling squadron which heads the main battle . There are six thousand men-at-arms with ten squadrons of slingers as far as I may judge their numbers . `` `` There are Frenchmen among them , my fair lord , '' remarked Black Simon . `` I can see the pennons of De Couvette , De Brieux , Saint Pol , and many others who struck in against us for Charles of Blois . `` `` You are right , '' said Sir William , `` for I can also see them . There is much Spanish blazonry also , if I could but read it . Don Diego , you know the arms of your own land . Who are they who have done us this honor ? `` The Spanish prisoner looked with exultant eyes upon the deep and serried ranks of his countrymen . `` By Saint James ! '' said he , `` if ye fall this day ye fall by no mean hands , for the flower of the knighthood of Castile ride under the banner of Don Tello , with the chivalry of Asturias , Toledo , Leon , Cordova , Galicia , and Seville . I see the guidons of Albornez , Cacorla , Rodriguez , Tavora , with the two great orders , and the knights of France
