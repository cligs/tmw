; they wrenched and split my bones . I was left as a dead man , yet God has breathed the breath of life back into me that I may help in this great work of the regeneration of France . `` `` Your sufferings , father , '' said Louis , resuming his seat , `` give you every claim , both upon the Church and upon me , who am its special champion and protector . What would you counsel , then , father , in the case of those Huguenots who refuse to change ? `` `` They would change , '' cried Du Chayla , with a drawn smile upon his ghastly face . `` They must bend or they must break . What matter if they be ground to powder , if we can but build up a complete Church in the land ? '' His deep-set eyes glowed with ferocity , and be shook one bony hand in savage wrath above his head . `` The cruelty with which you have been used , then , has not taught you to be more tender to others. '' '' Tender ! To heretics ! No , sire , my own pains have taught me that the world and the flesh are as nothing , and that the truest charity to another is to capture his soul at all risks to his vile body . I should have these Huguenot souls , sire , though I turned France into a shambles to gain them . `` Louis was evidently deeply impressed by the fearless words and the wild earnestness of the speaker . He leaned his head upon his hand for a little time , and remained sunk in the deepest thought . `` Besides , sire , '' said Pere la Chaise softly , `` there would be little need for these stronger measures of which the good abbe speaks . As I have already remarked to you , you are so beloved in your kingdom that the mere assurance that you had expressed your will upon the subject would be enough to turn them all to the true faith . `` `` I wish that I could think so , father ; I wish that I could think so.But what is this ? `` It was his valet who had half opened the door . `` Captain de Catinat is here , who desires to see you at once , sire . `` `` Ask the captain to enter . Ah ! '' A happy thought seemed to have struck him . `` We shall see what love for me will do in such a matter , for if it is anywhere to be found it must be among my own body-servants . `` The guardsman had arrived that instant from his long ride , and leaving Amos Green with the horses , he had come on at once , all dusty and travel-stained , to carry his message to the king . He entered now , and stood with the quiet ease of a man who is used to such scenes , his hand raised in a salute . `` What news , captain ? `` `` Major de Brissac bade me tell you , sire , that he held the Castle ofPortillac , that the lady is safe , and that her husband is a prisoner . `` Louis and his wife exchanged a quick glance of relief . `` That is well , '' said he . `` By the way , captain , you have served me in many ways of late , and always with success . I hear , Louvois , that De la Salle is dead of the small-pox . `` `` He died yesterday , sire . `` `` Then I desire that you make out the vacant commission of major to Monsieur de Catinat . Let me be the first to congratulate you , major , upon your promotion , though you will need to exchange the blue coat for the pearl and gray of the mousquetaires . We can not spare you from the household , you see . `` De Catinat kissed the hand which the monarch held out to him . `` May I be worthy of your kindness , sire ! `` `` You would do what you could to serve me , would you not ? `` `` My life is yours , sire . `` `` Very good . Then I shall put your fidelity to the proof . `` `` I am ready for any proof . `` `` It is not a very severe one . You see this paper upon the table . It is an order that all the Huguenots in my dominions shall give up their errors , under pain of banishment or captivity . Now I have hopes that there are many of my faithful subjects who are at fault in this matter , but who will abjure it when they learn that it is my clearly expressed wish that they should do so . It would be a great joy to me to find that it was so , for it would be a pain to me to use force against any man who bears the name of Frenchman . Do you follow me ? `` `` Yes , sire . '' The young man had turned deadly pale , and he shifted his feet , and opened and clasped his hands . He had faced death a dozen times and under many different forms , but never had he felt such a sinking of the heart as came over him now . `` You are yourself a Huguenot , I understand . I would gladly have you , then , as the first-fruit of this great measure . Let us hear from your own lips that you , for one , are ready to follow the lead of your king in this as in other things . `` The young guardsman still hesitated , though his doubts were rather as to how he should frame his reply than as to what its substance should be . He felt that in an instant Fortune had wiped out all the good turns which she had done him during his past life , and that now , far from being in her debt , he held a heavy score against her . The king arched his eyebrows and drummed his fingers impatiently as he glanced at the downcast face and dejected bearing . `` Why all this thought ? '' he cried . `` You are a man whom I have raised and whom I will raise . He who has a major 's epaulettes at thirty may carry a marshal 's baton at fifty . Your past is mine , and your future shall be no less so . What other hopes have you ? `` `` I have none , sire , outside your service . `` `` Why this silence , then ? Why do you not give the assurance which I demand ? `` `` I can not do it , sire . `` `` You can not do it ! `` `` It is impossible . I should have no more peace in my mind , or respect for myself , if I knew that for the sake of position or wealth I had given up the faith of my fathers . `` `` Man , you are surely mad ! There is all that a man could covet upon one side , and what is there upon the other ? `` `` There is my honour . `` `` And is it , then , a dishonour to embrace my religion ? `` `` It would be a dishonour to me to embrace it for the sake of gain without believing in it . `` `` Then believe it . `` `` Alas , sire , a man can not force himself to believe . Belief is a thing which must come to him , not he to it . `` `` On my word , father , '' said Louis , glancing with a bitter smile at hisJesuit confessor , `` I shall have to pick the cadets of the household fromyour seminary , since my officers have turned casuists and theologians.So , for the last time , you refuse to obey my request ? `` `` Oh , sire -- - '' De Catinat took a step forward with outstretched hands and tears in his eyes.But the king checked him with a gesture . `` I desire no protestations , '' said he . `` I judge a man by his acts . Do you abjure or not ? `` `` I can not , sire . `` `` You see , '' said Louis , turning again to the Jesuit , `` it will not be as easy as you think . `` `` This man is obstinate , it is true , but many others will be more yielding . `` The king shook his head . `` I would that I knew what to do , '' said he . `` Madame , I know that you , at least , will ever give me the best advice.You have heard all that has been said . What do you recommend ? `` She kept her eyes still fixed upon her tapestry , but her voice was firm and clear as she answered : -- - '' You have yourself said that you are the eldest son of the Church . If the eldest son desert her , then who will do her bidding ? And there is truth , too , in what the holy abbe has said . You may imperil your own soul by condoning this sin of heresy . It grows and flourishes , and if it be not rooted out now , it may choke the truth as weeds and briers choke the wheat . `` `` There are districts in France now , '' said Bossuet , `` where a church is not to be seen in a day 's journey , and where all the folk , from the nobles to the peasants , are of the same accursed faith . So it is in the Cevennes , where the people are as fierce and rugged as their own mountains . Heaven guard the priests who have to bring them back from their errors . `` `` Whom should I send on so perilous a task ? '' asked Louis.The Abbe du Chayla was down in a instant upon his knees with his gaunt hands outstretched . `` Send me , sire ! Me ! '' he cried . `` I have never asked a favour of you , and never will again . But I am the man who could break this people . Send me with your message to the people of the Cevennes . `` `` God help the people of the Cevennes ! '' muttered Louis , as he looked with mingled respect and loathing at the emaciated face and fiery eyes of the fanatic . `` Very well , abbe , '' he added aloud ; `` you shall go to the Cevennes . `` Perhaps for an instant there came upon the stern priest some premonition of that dreadful morning when , as he crouched in a corner of 'his burning home , fifty daggers were to rasp against each other in his body . He sunk his face in his hands , and a shudder passed over his gaunt frame . Then he rose , and folding his arms , he resumed his impassive attitude . Louis took up the pen from the table , and drew the paper towards
