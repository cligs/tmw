, '' I answered in astonishment . `` Ah , that 's lucky , '' he said , and not another word would he utter that night.Next morning , after breakfast , we found Inspector MacDonald and White Mason seated in close consultation in the small parlour of the local police sergeant . On the table in front of them were piled a number of letters and telegrams , which they were carefully sorting and docketing . Three had been placed on one side . `` Still on the track of the elusive bicyclist ? '' Holmes asked cheerfully . `` What is the latest news of the ruffian ? `` MacDonald pointed ruefully to his heap of correspondence . `` He is at present reported from Leicester , Nottingham , Southampton , Derby , East Ham , Richmond , and fourteen other places . In three of them -- -East Ham , Leicester , and Liverpool -- -there is a clear case against him , and he has actually been arrested . The country seems to be full of the fugitives with yellow coats . `` `` Dear me ! '' said Holmes sympathetically . `` Now , Mr. Mac and you , Mr. White Mason , I wish to give you a very earnest piece of advice . When I went into this case with you I bargained , as you will no doubt remember , that I should not present you with half-proved theories , but that I should retain and work out my own ideas until I had satisfied myself that they were correct . For this reason I am not at the present moment telling you all that is in my mind . On the other hand , I said that I would play the game fairly by you , and I do not think it is a fair game to allow you for one unnecessary moment to waste your energies upon a profitless task . Therefore I am here to advise you this morning , and my advice to you is summed up in three words -- -abandon the case . `` MacDonald and White Mason stared in amazement at their celebrated colleague . `` You consider it hopeless ! '' cried the inspector . `` I consider your case to be hopeless . I do not consider that it is hopeless to arrive at the truth . `` `` But this cyclist . He is not an invention . We have his description , his valise , his bicycle . The fellow must be somewhere . Why should we not get him ? `` `` Yes , yes , no doubt he is somewhere , and no doubt we shall get him ; but I would not have you waste your energies in East Ham or Liverpool . I am sure that we can find some shorter cut to a result . `` `` You are holding something back . It 's hardly fair of you , Mr . Holmes . '' The inspector was annoyed . `` You know my methods of work , Mr. Mac . But I will hold it back for the shortest time possible . I only wish to verify my details in one way , which can very readily be done , and then I make my bow and return to London , leaving my results entirely at your service . I owe you too much to act otherwise ; for in all my experience I can not recall any more singular and interesting study . `` `` This is clean beyond me , Mr. Holmes . We saw you when we returned from Tunbridge Wells last night , and you were in general agreement with our results . What has happened since then to give you a completely new idea of the case ? `` `` Well , since you ask me , I spent , as I told you that I would , some hours last night at the Manor House . `` `` Well , what happened ? `` `` Ah , I can only give you a very general answer to that for the moment . By the way , I have been reading a short but clear and interesting account of the old building , purchasable at the modest sum of one penny from the local tobacconist . `` Here Holmes drew a small tract , embellished with a rude engraving of the ancient Manor House , from his waistcoat pocket . `` It immensely adds to the zest of an investigation , my dear Mr. Mac , when one is in conscious sympathy with the historical atmosphere of one 's surroundings . Do n't look so impatient ; for I assure you that even so bald an account as this raises some sort of picture of the past in one 's mind . Permit me to give you a sample . 'Erected in the fifth year of the reign of James I , and standing upon the site of a much older building , the Manor House of Birlstone presents one of the finest surviving examples of the moated Jacobean residence -- - ' '' '' You are making fools of us , Mr . Holmes ! `` `` Tut , tut , Mr . Mac ! -- -the first sign of temper I have detected in you . Well , I wo n't read it verbatim , since you feel so strongly upon the subject . But when I tell you that there is some account of the taking of the place by a parliamentary colonel in 1644 , of the concealment of Charles for several days in the course of the Civil War , and finally of a visit there by the second George , you will admit that there are various associations of interest connected with this ancient house . `` `` I do n't doubt it , Mr. Holmes ; but that is no business of ours . `` `` Is it not ? Is it not ? Breadth of view , my dear Mr. Mac , is one of the essentials of our profession . The interplay of ideas and the oblique uses of knowledge are often of extraordinary interest . You will excuse these remarks from one who , though a mere connoisseur of crime , is still rather older and perhaps more experienced than yourself . `` `` I 'm the first to admit that , '' said the detective heartily . `` You get to your point , I admit ; but you have such a deuced round-the-corner way of doing it . `` `` Well , well , I 'll drop past history and get down to present-day facts . I called last night , as I have already said , at the Manor House . I did not see either Barker or Mrs. Douglas . I saw no necessity to disturb them ; but I was pleased to hear that the lady was not visibly pining and that she had partaken of an excellent dinner . My visit was specially made to the good Mr. Ames , with whom I exchanged some amiabilities , which culminated in his allowing me , without reference to anyone else , to sit alone for a time in the study. '' '' What ! With that ? '' I ejaculated . `` No , no , everything is now in order . You gave permission for that , Mr. Mac , as I am informed . The room was in its normal state , and in it I passed an instructive quarter of an hour . `` `` What were you doing ? `` `` Well , not to make a mystery of so simple a matter , I was looking for the missing dumb-bell . It has always bulked rather large in my estimate of the case . I ended by finding it. '' '' Where ? `` `` Ah , there we come to the edge of the unexplored . Let me go a little further , a very little further , and I will promise that you shall share everything that I know . `` `` Well , we 're bound to take you on your own terms , '' said the inspector ; `` but when it comes to telling us to abandon the case -- -why in the name of goodness should we abandon the case ? `` `` For the simple reason , my dear Mr. Mac , that you have not got the first idea what it is that you are investigating . `` `` We are investigating the murder of Mr. John Douglas of Birlstone Manor . `` `` Yes , yes , so you are . But do n't trouble to trace the mysterious gentleman upon the bicycle . I assure you that it wo n't help you . `` `` Then what do you suggest that we do ? `` `` I will tell you exactly what to do , if you will do it . `` `` Well , I 'm bound to say I 've always found you had reason behind all your queer ways . I 'll do what you advise . `` `` And you , Mr. White Mason ? `` The country detective looked helplessly from one to the other . Holmes and his methods were new to him . `` Well , if it is good enough for the inspector , it is good enough for me , '' he said at last. '' Capital ! '' said Holmes . `` Well , then , I should recommend a nice , cheery country walk for both of you . They tell me that the views from Birlstone Ridge over the Weald are very remarkable . No doubt lunch could be got at some suitable hostelry ; though my ignorance of the country prevents me from recommending one . In the evening , tired but happy -- - '' '' Man , this is getting past a joke ! '' cried MacDonald , rising angrily from his chair . `` Well , well , spend the day as you like , '' said Holmes , patting him cheerfully upon the shoulder . `` Do what you like and go where you will , but meet me here before dusk without fail -- -without fail , Mr . Mac . `` `` That sounds more like sanity . `` `` All of it was excellent advice ; but I do n't insist , so long as you are here when I need you . But now , before we part , I want you to write a note to Mr . Barker. '' '' Well ? `` `` I 'll dictate it , if you like . Ready ? `` Dear Sir : '' It has struck me that it is our duty to drain the moat , in the hope that we may find some -- - '' '' It 's impossible , '' said the inspector . `` I 've made inquiry . `` `` Tut , tut ! My dear sir , please do what I ask you . `` `` Well , go on . '' '' -- -in the hope that we may find something which may bear upon our investigation . I have made arrangements , and the workmen will be at work early to-morrow morning diverting the stream -- - '' '' Impossible ! '' '' -- -diverting the stream ; so I thought it best to explain matters beforehand . `` Now sign that , and send it by hand about four o'clock . At that hour we shall meet again in this room . Until then we may each do what we like ; for I can assure you that this inquiry
