had never set foot in this house before I am through with you ! `` `` No time like the present , '' cried McMurdo . `` I 'll choose my own time , mister . You can leave the time to me . See here ! '' He suddenly rolled up his sleeve and showed upon his forearm a peculiar sign which appeared to have been branded there . It was a circle with a triangle within it . `` D'you know what that means ? `` `` I neither know nor care ! `` `` Well , you will know , I 'll promise you that . You wo n't be much older , either . Perhaps Miss Ettie can tell you something about it . As to you , Ettie , you 'll come back to me on your knees -- - d 'ye hear , girl ? -- -on your knees -- -and then I 'll tell you what your punishment may be . You 've sowed -- -and by the Lord , I 'll see that you reap ! '' He glanced at them both in fury . Then he turned upon his heel , and an instant later the outer door had banged behind him.For a few moments McMurdo and the girl stood in silence . Then she threw her arms around him . `` Oh , Jack , how brave you were ! But it is no use , you must fly ! To-night -- -Jack -- -to-night ! It 's your only hope . He will have your life . I read it in his horrible eyes . What chance have you against a dozen of them , with Boss McGinty and all the power of the lodge behind them ? `` McMurdo disengaged her hands , kissed her , and gently pushed her back into a chair . `` There , acushla , there ! Do n't be disturbed or fear for me . I 'm a Freeman myself . I 'm after telling your father about it . Maybe I am no better than the others ; so do n't make a saint of me . Perhaps you hate me too , now that I 've told you as much ? `` `` Hate you , Jack ? While life lasts I could never do that ! I 've heard that there is no harm in being a Freeman anywhere but here ; so why should I think the worse of you for that ? But if you are a Freeman , Jack , why should you not go down and make a friend of Boss McGinty ? Oh , hurry , Jack , hurry ! Get your word in first , or the hounds will be on your trail . `` `` I was thinking the same thing , '' said McMurdo . `` I 'll go right now and fix it . You can tell your father that I 'll sleep here to-night and find some other quarters in the morning . `` The bar of McGinty 's saloon was crowded as usual ; for it was the favourite loafing place of all the rougher elements of the town . The man was popular ; for he had a rough , jovial disposition which formed a mask , covering a great deal which lay behind it . But apart from this popularity , the fear in which he was held throughout the township , and indeed down the whole thirty miles of the valley and past the mountains on each side of it , was enough in itself to fill his bar ; for none could afford to neglect his good will.Besides those secret powers which it was universally believed that he exercised in so pitiless a fashion , he was a high public official , a municipal councillor , and a commissioner of roads , elected to the office through the votes of the ruffians who in turn expected to receive favours at his hands . Assessments and taxes were enormous ; the public works were notoriously neglected , the accounts were slurred over by bribed auditors , and the decent citizen was terrorized into paying public blackmail , and holding his tongue lest some worse thing befall him.Thus it was that , year by year , Boss McGinty 's diamond pins became more obtrusive , his gold chains more weighty across a more gorgeous vest , and his saloon stretched farther and farther , until it threatened to absorb one whole side of the Market Square.McMurdo pushed open the swinging door of the saloon and made his way amid the crowd of men within , through an atmosphere blurred with tobacco smoke and heavy with the smell of spirits . The place was brilliantly lighted , and the huge , heavily gilt mirrors upon every wall reflected and multiplied the garish illumination . There were several bartenders in their shirt sleeves , hard at work mixing drinks for the loungers who fringed the broad , brass-trimmed counter.At the far end , with his body resting upon the bar and a cigar stuck at an acute angle from the corner of his mouth , stood a tall , strong , heavily built man who could be none other than the famous McGinty himself . He was a black-maned giant , bearded to the cheek-bones , and with a shock of raven hair which fell to his collar . His complexion was as swarthy as that of an Italian , and his eyes were of a strange dead black , which , combined with a slight squint , gave them a particularly sinister appearance.All else in the man -- -his noble proportions , his fine features , and his frank bearing -- -fitted in with that jovial , man-to-man manner which he affected . Here , one would say , is a bluff , honest fellow , whose heart would be sound however rude his outspoken words might seem . It was only when those dead , dark eyes , deep and remorseless , were turned upon a man that he shrank within himself , feeling that he was face to face with an infinite possibility of latent evil , with a strength and courage and cunning behind it which made it a thousand times more deadly.Having had a good look at his man , McMurdo elbowed his way forward with his usual careless audacity , and pushed himself through the little group of courtiers who were fawning upon the powerful boss , laughing uproariously at the smallest of his jokes . The young stranger 's bold gray eyes looked back fearlessly through their glasses at the deadly black ones which turned sharply upon him . `` Well , young man , I ca n't call your face to mind . `` `` I 'm new here , Mr . McGinty . `` `` You are not so new that you ca n't give a gentleman his proper title . `` `` He 's Councillor McGinty , young man , '' said a voice from the group . `` I 'm sorry , Councillor . I 'm strange to the ways of the place . But I was advised to see you . `` `` Well , you see me . This is all there is . What d'you think of me ? `` `` Well , it 's early days . If your heart is as big as your body , and your soul as fine as your face , then I 'd ask for nothing better , '' said McMurdo . `` By Gar ! you 've got an Irish tongue in your head anyhow , '' cried the saloon-keeper , not quite certain whether to humour this audacious visitor or to stand upon his dignity . `` So you are good enough to pass my appearance ? `` `` Sure , '' said McMurdo . `` And you were told to see me ? `` `` I was . `` `` And who told you ? `` `` Brother Scanlan of Lodge 341 , Vermissa . I drink your health Councillor , and to our better acquaintance . '' He raised a glass with which he had been served to his lips and elevated his little finger as he drank it.McGinty , who had been watching him narrowly , raised his thick black eyebrows . `` Oh , it 's like that , is it ? '' said he . `` I 'll have to look a bit closer into this , Mister -- - '' '' McMurdo . `` `` A bit closer , Mr. McMurdo ; for we do n't take folk on trust in these parts , nor believe all we 're told neither . Come in here for a moment , behind the bar . `` There was a small room there , lined with barrels . McGinty carefully closed the door , and then seated himself on one of them , biting thoughtfully on his cigar and surveying his companion with those disquieting eyes . For a couple of minutes he sat in complete silence . McMurdo bore the inspection cheerfully , one hand in his coat pocket , the other twisting his brown moustache . Suddenly McGinty stooped and produced a wicked-looking revolver . `` See here , my joker , '' said he , `` if I thought you were playing any game on us , it would be short work for you . `` `` This is a strange welcome , '' McMurdo answered with some dignity , `` for the Bodymaster of a lodge of Freemen to give to a stranger brother . `` `` Ay , but it 's just that same that you have to prove , '' said McGinty , `` and God help you if you fail ! Where were you made ? `` `` Lodge 29 , Chicago. '' '' When ? `` `` June 24 , 1872 . `` `` What Bodymaster ? `` `` James H . Scott . `` `` Who is your district ruler ? `` `` Bartholomew Wilson. '' '' Hum ! You seem glib enough in your tests . What are you doing here ? `` `` Working , the same as you -- -but a poorer job . `` `` You have your back answer quick enough . `` `` Yes , I was always quick of speech . `` `` Are you quick of action ? `` `` I have had that name among those that knew me best . `` `` Well , we may try you sooner than you think . Have you heard anything of the lodge in these parts ? `` `` I 've heard that it takes a man to be a brother . `` `` True for you , Mr. McMurdo . Why did you leave Chicago ? `` `` I 'm damned if I tell you that ! `` McGinty opened his eyes . He was not used to being answered in such fashion , and it amused him . `` Why wo n't you tell me ? `` `` Because no brother may tell another a lie . `` `` Then the truth is too bad to tell ? `` `` You can put it that way if you like . `` `` See here , mister , you ca n't expect me , as Bodymaster , to pass into the lodge a man for whose past he ca n't answer . `` McMurdo looked puzzled . Then he took a worn newspaper cutting from an inner pocket . `` You would n't squeal on a fellow ? '' said he . `` I 'll wipe my hand across your face if you say such words to me ! '' cried McGinty hotly . ``
