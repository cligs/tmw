`` I see that you have read it since you have marked it . I do n't deny that it is smartly written . It irritates me though . It is evidently the theory of some arm-chair lounger who evolves all these neat little paradoxes in the seclusion of his own study . It is not practical . I should like to see him clapped down in a third class carriage on the Underground , and asked to give the trades of all his fellow-travellers . I would lay a thousand to one against him . `` `` You would lose your money , '' Sherlock Holmes remarked calmly . `` As for the article I wrote it myself. '' '' You ! `` `` Yes , I have a turn both for observation and for deduction . The theories which I have expressed there , and which appear to you to be so chimerical are really extremely practical -- -so practical that I depend upon them for my bread and cheese . `` `` And how ? '' I asked involuntarily . `` Well , I have a trade of my own . I suppose I am the only one in the world . I 'm a consulting detective , if you can understand what that is . Here in London we have lots of Government detectives and lots of private ones . When these fellows are at fault they come to me , and I manage to put them on the right scent . They lay all the evidence before me , and I am generally able , by the help of my knowledge of the history of crime , to set them straight . There is a strong family resemblance about misdeeds , and if you have all the details of a thousand at your finger ends , it is odd if you ca n't unravel the thousand and first . Lestrade is a well-known detective . He got himself into a fog recently over a forgery case , and that was what brought him here . `` `` And these other people ? `` `` They are mostly sent on by private inquiry agencies . They are all people who are in trouble about something , and want a little enlightening . I listen to their story , they listen to my comments , and then I pocket my fee . `` `` But do you mean to say , '' I said , `` that without leaving your room you can unravel some knot which other men can make nothing of , although they have seen every detail for themselves ? `` `` Quite so . I have a kind of intuition that way . Now and again a case turns up which is a little more complex . Then I have to bustle about and see things with my own eyes . You see I have a lot of special knowledge which I apply to the problem , and which facilitates matters wonderfully . Those rules of deduction laid down in that article which aroused your scorn , are invaluable to me in practical work . Observation with me is second nature . You appeared to be surprised when I told you , on our first meeting , that you had come from Afghanistan . `` `` You were told , no doubt . `` `` Nothing of the sort . Iknewyou came from Afghanistan . From long habit the train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my mind , that I arrived at the conclusion without being conscious of intermediate steps . There were such steps , however . The train of reasoning ran , 'Here is a gentleman of a medical type , but with the air of a military man . Clearly an army doctor , then . He has just come from the tropics , for his face is dark , and that is not the natural tint of his skin , for his wrists are fair . He has undergone hardship and sickness , as his haggard face says clearly . His left arm has been injured . He holds it in a stiff and unnatural manner . Where in the tropics could an English army doctor have seen much hardship and got his arm wounded ? Clearly in Afghanistan . ' The whole train of thought did not occupy a second . I then remarked that you came from Afghanistan , and you were astonished . `` `` It is simple enough as you explain it , '' I said , smiling . `` You remind me of Edgar Allen Poe 's Dupin . I had no idea that such individuals did exist outside of stories . `` Sherlock Holmes rose and lit his pipe . `` No doubt you think that you are complimenting me in comparing me to Dupin , '' he observed . `` Now , in my opinion , Dupin was a very inferior fellow . That trick of his of breaking in on his friends ' thoughts with an apropos remark after a quarter of an hour 's silence is really very showy and superficial . He had some analytical genius , no doubt ; but he was by no means such a phenomenon as Poe appeared to imagine . `` `` Have you read Gaboriau 's works ? '' I asked . `` Does Lecoq come up to your idea of a detective ? `` Sherlock Holmes sniffed sardonically . `` Lecoq was a miserable bungler , '' he said , in an angry voice ; `` he had only one thing to recommend him , and that was his energy . That book made me positively ill . The question was how to identify an unknown prisoner . I could have done it in twenty-four hours . Lecoq took six months or so . It might be made a text-book for detectives to teach them what to avoid . `` I felt rather indignant at having two characters whom I had admired treated in this cavalier style . I walked over to the window , and stood looking out into the busy street . `` This fellow may be very clever , '' I said to myself , `` but he is certainly very conceited . `` `` There are no crimes and no criminals in these days , '' he said , querulously . `` What is the use of having brains in our profession . I know well that I have it in me to make my name famous . No man lives or has ever lived who has brought the same amount of study and of natural talent to the detection of crime which I have done . And what is the result ? There is no crime to detect , or , at most , some bungling villainy with a motive so transparent that even a Scotland Yard official can see through it . `` I was still annoyed at his bumptious style of conversation . I thought it best to change the topic . `` I wonder what that fellow is looking for ? '' I asked , pointing to a stalwart , plainly-dressed individual who was walking slowly down the other side of the street , looking anxiously at the numbers . He had a large blue envelope in his hand , and was evidently the bearer of a message . `` You mean the retired sergeant of Marines , '' said Sherlock Holmes . `` Brag and bounce ! '' thought I to myself . `` He knows that I can not verify his guess . `` The thought had hardly passed through my mind when the man whom we were watching caught sight of the number on our door , and ran rapidly across the roadway . We heard a loud knock , a deep voice below , and heavy steps ascending the stair . `` For Mr. Sherlock Holmes , '' he said , stepping into the room and handing my friend the letter.Here was an opportunity of taking the conceit out of him . He little thought of this when he made that random shot . `` May I ask , my lad , '' I said , in the blandest voice , `` what your trade may be ? `` `` Commissionaire , sir , '' he said , gruffly . `` Uniform away for repairs . `` `` And you were ? '' I asked , with a slightly malicious glance at my companion . `` A sergeant , sir , Royal Marine Light Infantry , sir . No answer ? Right , sir . `` He clicked his heels together , raised his hand in a salute , and was gone.I CONFESS that I was considerably startled by this fresh proof of the practical nature of my companion 's theories . My respect for his powers of analysis increased wondrously . There still remained some lurking suspicion in my mind , however , that the whole thing was a pre-arranged episode , intended to dazzle me , though what earthly object he could have in taking me in was past my comprehension . When I looked at him he had finished reading the note , and his eyes had assumed the vacant , lack-lustre expression which showed mental abstraction . `` How in the world did you deduce that ? '' I asked . `` Deduce what ? '' said he , petulantly . `` Why , that he was a retired sergeant of Marines . `` `` I have no time for trifles , '' he answered , brusquely ; then with a smile , `` Excuse my rudeness . You broke the thread of my thoughts ; but perhaps it is as well . So you actually were not able to see that that man was a sergeant of Marines ? `` `` No , indeed . `` `` It was easier to know it than to explain why I knew it . If you were asked to prove that two and two made four , you might find some difficulty , and yet you are quite sure of the fact . Even across the street I could see a great blue anchor tattooed on the back of the fellow 's hand . That smacked of the sea . He had a military carriage , however , and regulation side whiskers . There we have the marine . He was a man with some amount of self-importance and a certain air of command . You must have observed the way in which he held his head and swung his cane . A steady , respectable , middle-aged man , too , on the face of him -- -all facts which led me to believe that he had been a sergeant. '' '' Wonderful ! '' I ejaculated . `` Commonplace , '' said Holmes , though I thought from his expression that he was pleased at my evident surprise and admiration . `` I said just now that there were no criminals . It appears that I am wrong -- -look at this ! '' He threw me over the note which the commissionaire had brought . 7 '' Why , '' I cried , as I cast my eye over it , `` this is terrible ! `` `` It does seem to be a little out of the common , '' he remarked , calmly . `` Would you mind reading it to me aloud ? `` This is the letter which I read to him -- -- -- '' MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES , -- - '' There has been a bad business during the night at 3 , Lauriston Gardens , off the Brixton Road . Our man on the beat
