saw a light there about two in the morning , and as the house was an empty one , suspected that something was amiss . He found the door open , and in the front room , which is bare of furniture , discovered the body of a gentleman , well dressed , and having cards in his pocket bearing the name of 'Enoch J. Drebber , Cleveland , Ohio , U.S.A. ' There had been no robbery , nor is there any evidence as to how the man met his death . There are marks of blood in the room , but there is no wound upon his person . We are at a loss as to how he came into the empty house ; indeed , the whole affair is a puzzler . If you can come round to the house any time before twelve , you will find me there . I have left everythingin statu quountil I hear from you . If you are unable to come I shall give you fuller details , and would esteem it a great kindness if you would favour me with your opinion . Yours faithfully , '' TOBIAS GREGSON . `` `` Gregson is the smartest of the Scotland Yarders , '' my friend remarked ; `` he and Lestrade are the pick of a bad lot . They are both quick and energetic , but conventional -- -shockingly so . They have their knives into one another , too . They are as jealous as a pair of professional beauties . There will be some fun over this case if they are both put upon the scent . `` I was amazed at the calm way in which he rippled on . `` Surely there is not a moment to be lost , '' I cried , `` shall I go and order you a cab ? `` `` I 'm not sure about whether I shall go . I am the most incurably lazy devil that ever stood in shoe leather -- -that is , when the fit is on me , for I can be spry enough at times . `` `` Why , it is just such a chance as you have been longing for . `` `` My dear fellow , what does it matter to me . Supposing I unravel the whole matter , you may be sure that Gregson , Lestrade , and Co. will pocket all the credit . That comes of being an unofficial personage . `` `` But he begs you to help him. '' '' Yes . He knows that I am his superior , and acknowledges it to me ; but he would cut his tongue out before he would own it to any third person . However , we may as well go and have a look . I shall work it out on my own hook . I may have a laugh at them if I have nothing else . Come on ! `` He hustled on his overcoat , and bustled about in a way that showed that an energetic fit had superseded the apathetic one . `` Get your hat , '' he said . `` You wish me to come ? `` `` Yes , if you have nothing better to do . '' A minute later we were both in a hansom , driving furiously for the Brixton Road.It was a foggy , cloudy morning , and a dun-coloured veil hung over the house-tops , looking like the reflection of the mud-coloured streets beneath . My companion was in the best of spirits , and prattled away about Cremona fiddles , and the difference between a Stradivarius and an Amati . As for myself , I was silent , for the dull weather and the melancholy business upon which we were engaged , depressed my spirits . `` You do n't seem to give much thought to the matter in hand , '' I said at last , interrupting Holmes ' musical disquisition . `` No data yet , '' he answered . `` It is a capital mistake to theorize before you have all the evidence . It biases the judgment . `` `` You will have your data soon , '' I remarked , pointing with my finger ; `` this is the Brixton Road , and that is the house , if I am not very much mistaken . `` `` So it is . Stop , driver , stop ! '' We were still a hundred yards or so from it , but he insisted upon our alighting , and we finished our journey upon foot.Number 3 , Lauriston Gardens wore an ill-omened and minatory look . It was one of four which stood back some little way from the street , two being occupied and two empty . The latter looked out with three tiers of vacant melancholy windows , which were blank and dreary , save that here and there a `` To Let '' card had developed like a cataract upon the bleared panes . A small garden sprinkled over with a scattered eruption of sickly plants separated each of these houses from the street , and was traversed by a narrow pathway , yellowish in colour , and consisting apparently of a mixture of clay and of gravel . The whole place was very sloppy from the rain which had fallen through the night . The garden was bounded by a three-foot brick wall with a fringe of wood rails upon the top , and against this wall was leaning a stalwart police constable , surrounded by a small knot of loafers , who craned their necks and strained their eyes in the vain hope of catching some glimpse of the proceedings within.I had imagined that Sherlock Holmes would at once have hurried into the house and plunged into a study of the mystery . Nothing appeared to be further from his intention . With an air of nonchalance which , under the circumstances , seemed to me to border upon affectation , he lounged up and down the pavement , and gazed vacantly at the ground , the sky , the opposite houses and the line of railings . Having finished his scrutiny , he proceeded slowly down the path , or rather down the fringe of grass which flanked the path , keeping his eyes riveted upon the ground . Twice he stopped , and once I saw him smile , and heard him utter an exclamation of satisfaction . There were many marks of footsteps upon the wet clayey soil , but since the police had been coming and going over it , I was unable to see how my companion could hope to learn anything from it . Still I had had such extraordinary evidence of the quickness of his perceptive faculties , that I had no doubt that he could see a great deal which was hidden from me.At the door of the house we were met by a tall , white-faced , flaxen-haired man , with a notebook in his hand , who rushed forward and wrung my companion 's hand with effusion . `` It is indeed kind of you to come , '' he said , `` I have had everything left untouched . `` `` Except that ! '' my friend answered , pointing at the pathway . `` If a herd of buffaloes had passed along there could not be a greater mess . No doubt , however , you had drawn your own conclusions , Gregson , before you permitted this . `` `` I have had so much to do inside the house , '' the detective said evasively . `` My colleague , Mr. Lestrade , is here . I had relied upon him to look after this . `` Holmes glanced at me and raised his eyebrows sardonically . `` With two such men as yourself and Lestrade upon the ground , there will not be much for a third party to find out , '' he said.Gregson rubbed his hands in a self-satisfied way . `` I think we have done all that can be done , '' he answered ; `` it 's a queer case though , and I knew your taste for such things . `` `` You did not come here in a cab ? '' asked Sherlock Holmes . `` No , sir . `` `` Nor Lestrade ? `` `` No , sir . `` `` Then let us go and look at the room . '' With which inconsequent remark he strode on into the house , followed by Gregson , whose features expressed his astonishment.A short passage , bare planked and dusty , led to the kitchen and offices . Two doors opened out of it to the left and to the right . One of these had obviously been closed for many weeks . The other belonged to the dining-room , which was the apartment in which the mysterious affair had occurred . Holmes walked in , and I followed him with that subdued feeling at my heart which the presence of death inspires.It was a large square room , looking all the larger from the absence of all furniture . A vulgar flaring paper adorned the walls , but it was blotched in places with mildew , and here and there great strips had become detached and hung down , exposing the yellow plaster beneath . Opposite the door was a showy fireplace , surmounted by a mantelpiece of imitation white marble . On one corner of this was stuck the stump of a red wax candle . The solitary window was so dirty that the light was hazy and uncertain , giving a dull grey tinge to everything , which was intensified by the thick layer of dust which coated the whole apartment.All these details I observed afterwards . At present my attention was centred upon the single grim motionless figure which lay stretched upon the boards , with vacant sightless eyes staring up at the discoloured ceiling . It was that of a man about forty-three or forty-four years of age , middle-sized , broad shouldered , with crisp curling black hair , and a short stubbly beard . He was dressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat and waistcoat , with light-coloured trousers , and immaculate collar and cuffs . A top hat , well brushed and trim , was placed upon the floor beside him . His hands were clenched and his arms thrown abroad , while his lower limbs were interlocked as though his death struggle had been a grievous one . On his rigid face there stood an expression of horror , and as it seemed to me , of hatred , such as I have never seen upon human features . This malignant and terrible contortion , combined with the low forehead , blunt nose , and prognathous jaw gave the dead man a singularly simious and ape-like appearance , which was increased by his writhing , unnatural posture . I have seen death in many forms , but never has it appeared to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark grimy apartment , which looked out upon one of the main arteries of suburban London.Lestrade , lean and ferret-like as ever , was standing by the doorway , and greeted my companion and myself . `` This case will make a stir , sir , '' he remarked . `` It beats anything I have seen , and I am no chicken . `` `` There is no clue ? '' said Gregson . `` None at all , '' chimed in Lestrade.Sherlock Holmes approached the body , and , kneeling down , examined it intently .
