We have only to lay our hands on that man , and the rest will follow . `` `` No doubt , Mr. Mac . But how do you propose to lay your hands on the so-called Porlock ? `` MacDonald turned over the letter which Holmes had handed him . `` Posted in Camberwell -- -that does n't help us much . Name , you say , is assumed . Not much to go on , certainly . Did n't you say that you have sent him money ? '' '' Twice . `` `` And how ? `` `` In notes to Camberwell post office . `` `` Did you ever trouble to see who called for them ? '' '' No . `` The inspector looked surprised and a little shocked . `` Why not ? `` `` Because I always keep faith . I had promised when he first wrote that I would not try to trace him . `` `` You think there is someone behind him ? `` `` I know there is . `` `` This professor that I 've heard you mention ? '' '' Exactly ! `` Inspector MacDonald smiled , and his eyelid quivered as he glanced towards me . `` I wo n't conceal from you , Mr. Holmes , that we think in the C.I.D . that you have a wee bit of a bee in your bonnet over this professor . I made some inquiries myself about the matter . He seems to be a very respectable , learned , and talented sort of man . `` `` I 'm glad you 've got so far as to recognize the talent . `` `` Man , you ca n't but recognize it ! After I heard your view I made it my business to see him . I had a chat with him on eclipses . How the talk got that way I canna think ; but he had out a reflector lantern and a globe , and made it all clear in a minute . He lent me a book ; but I do n't mind saying that it was a bit above my head , though I had a good Aberdeen upbringing . He 'd have made a grand meenister with his thin face and gray hair and solemn-like way of talking . When he put his hand on my shoulder as we were parting , it was like a father 's blessing before you go out into the cold , cruel world . `` Holmes chuckled and rubbed his hands . `` Great ! '' he said . `` Great ! Tell me , Friend MacDonald , this pleasing and touching interview was , I suppose , in the professor 's study ? `` `` That 's so . `` `` A fine room , is it not ? `` `` Very fine -- -very handsome indeed , Mr . Holmes . `` `` You sat in front of his writing desk ? `` `` Just so . `` `` Sun in your eyes and his face in the shadow ? `` `` Well , it was evening ; but I mind that the lamp was turned on my face . `` `` It would be . Did you happen to observe a picture over the professor 's head ? `` `` I do n't miss much , Mr. Holmes . Maybe I learned that from you . Yes , I saw the picture -- -a young woman with her head on her hands , peeping at you sideways . `` `` That painting was by Jean Baptiste Greuze . `` The inspector endeavoured to look interested . `` Jean Baptiste Greuze , '' Holmes continued , joining his finger tips and leaning well back in his chair , `` was a French artist who flourished between the years 1750 and 1800 . I allude , of course to his working career . Modern criticism has more than indorsed the high opinion formed of him by his contemporaries . `` The inspector 's eyes grew abstracted . `` Had n't we better -- - '' he said . `` We are doing so , '' Holmes interrupted . `` All that I am saying has a very direct and vital bearing upon what you have called the Birlstone Mystery . In fact , it may in a sense be called the very centre of it . `` MacDonald smiled feebly , and looked appealingly to me . `` Your thoughts move a bit too quick for me , Mr. Holmes . You leave out a link or two , and I ca n't get over the gap . What in the whole wide world can be the connection between this dead painting man and the affair at Birlstone ? `` `` All knowledge comes useful to the detective , '' remarked Holmes . `` Even the trivial fact that in the year 1865 a picture by Greuze entitled La Jeune Fille a l'Agneau fetched one million two hundred thousand francs -- -more than forty thousand pounds -- -at the Portalis sale may start a train of reflection in your mind . `` It was clear that it did . The inspector looked honestly interested . `` I may remind you , '' Holmes continued , `` that the professor 's salary can be ascertained in several trustworthy books of reference . It is seven hundred a year . `` `` Then how could he buy -- - '' '' Quite so ! How could he ? `` `` Ay , that 's remarkable , '' said the inspector thoughtfully . `` Talk away , Mr. Holmes . I 'm just loving it . It 's fine ! `` Holmes smiled . He was always warmed by genuine admiration -- -the characteristic of the real artist . `` What about Birlstone ? '' he asked . `` We 've time yet , '' said the inspector , glancing at his watch . `` I 've a cab at the door , and it wo n't take us twenty minutes to Victoria . But about this picture : I thought you told me once , Mr. Holmes , that you had never met Professor Moriarty . `` `` No , I never have . `` `` Then how do you know about his rooms ? `` `` Ah , that 's another matter . I have been three times in his rooms , twice waiting for him under different pretexts and leaving before he came . Once -- -well , I can hardly tell about the once to an official detective . It was on the last occasion that I took the liberty of running over his papers -- -with the most unexpected results . `` `` You found something compromising ? `` `` Absolutely nothing . That was what amazed me . However , you have now seen the point of the picture . It shows him to be a very wealthy man . How did he acquire wealth ? He is unmarried . His younger brother is a station master in the west of England . His chair is worth seven hundred a year . And he owns a Greuze. '' '' Well ? `` `` Surely the inference is plain . `` `` You mean that he has a great income and that he must earn it in an illegal fashion ? '' '' Exactly . Of course I have other reasons for thinking so -- -dozens of exiguous threads which lead vaguely up towards the centre of the web where the poisonous , motionless creature is lurking . I only mention the Greuze because it brings the matter within the range of your own observation . `` `` Well , Mr. Holmes , I admit that what you say is interesting : it 's more than interesting -- -it 's just wonderful . But let us have it a little clearer if you can . Is it forgery , coining , burglary -- -where does the money come from ? `` `` Have you ever read of Jonathan Wild ? `` `` Well , the name has a familiar sound . Someone in a novel , was he not ? I do n't take much stock of detectives in novels -- -chaps that do things and never let you see how they do them . That 's just inspiration : not business . `` `` Jonathan Wild was n't a detective , and he was n't in a novel . He was a master criminal , and he lived last century -- -1750 or thereabouts . `` `` Then he 's no use to me . I 'm a practical man. '' '' Mr . Mac , the most practical thing that you ever did in your life would be to shut yourself up for three months and read twelve hours a day at the annals of crime . Everything comes in circles -- -even Professor Moriarty . Jonathan Wild was the hidden force of the London criminals , to whom he sold his brains and his organization on a fifteen per cent . commission . The old wheel turns , and the same spoke comes up . It 's all been done before , and will be again . I 'll tell you one or two things about Moriarty which may interest you . `` `` You 'll interest me , right enough . `` `` I happen to know who is the first link in his chain -- -a chain with this Napoleon-gone-wrong at one end , and a hundred broken fighting men , pickpockets , blackmailers , and card sharpers at the other , with every sort of crime in between . His chief of staff is Colonel Sebastian Moran , as aloof and guarded and inaccessible to the law as himself . What do you think he pays him ? `` `` I 'd like to hear . `` `` Six thousand a year . That 's paying for brains , you see -- -the American business principle . I learned that detail quite by chance . It 's more than the Prime Minister gets . That gives you an idea of Moriarty 's gains and of the scale on which he works . Another point : I made it my business to hunt down some of Moriarty 's checks lately -- -just common innocent checks that he pays his household bills with . They were drawn on six different banks . Does that make any impression on your mind ? `` `` Queer , certainly ! But what do you gather from it ? `` `` That he wanted no gossip about his wealth . No single man should know what he had . I have no doubt that he has twenty banking accounts ; the bulk of his fortune abroad in the Deutsche Bank or the Credit Lyonnais as likely as not . Sometime when you have a year or two to spare I commend to you the study of Professor Moriarty . `` Inspector MacDonald had grown steadily more impressed as the conversation proceeded . He had lost himself in his interest . Now his practical Scotch intelligence brought him back with a snap to the matter in hand . `` He can keep , anyhow , '' said he . `` You 've got us side-tracked with your interesting anecdotes , Mr. Holmes . What really counts is your remark that there is some connection between the professor and the crime . That you get from the warning received through the man Porlock . Can we for our present practical needs get any further than that ? `` `` We may form some conception as to the motives of the crime . It is
