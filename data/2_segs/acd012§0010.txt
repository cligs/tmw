Gazette ! Had ever a journalist such an opening and so little chance of using it -- -the scoop of scoops , and no one to appreciate it ? And then , suddenly , the old instinct of recording came over me . If these men of science could be so true to their life 's work to the very end , why should not I , in my humble way , be as constant ? No human eye might ever rest upon what I had done . But the long night had to be passed somehow , and for me at least , sleep seemed to be out of the question . My notes would help to pass the weary hours and to occupy my thoughts . Thus it is that now I have before me the notebook with its scribbled pages , written confusedly upon my knee in the dim , waning light of our one electric torch . Had I the literary touch , they might have been worthy of the occasion . As it is , they may still serve to bring to other minds the long-drawn emotions and tremors of that awful night.How strange the words look scribbled at the top of the empty page of my book ! How stranger still that it is I , Edward Malone , who have written them -- -I who started only some twelve hours ago from my rooms in Streatham without one thought of the marvels which the day was to bring forth ! I look back at the chain of incidents , my interview with McArdle , Challenger 's first note of alarm in the Times , the absurd journey in the train , the pleasant luncheon , the catastrophe , and now it has come to this -- -that we linger alone upon an empty planet , and so sure is our fate that I can regard these lines , written from mechanical professional habit and never to be seen by human eyes , as the words of one who is already dead , so closely does he stand to the shadowed borderland over which all outside this one little circle of friends have already gone . I feel how wise and true were the words of Challenger when he said that the real tragedy would be if we were left behind when all that is noble and good and beautiful had passed . But of that there can surely be no danger . Already our second tube of oxygen is drawing to an end . We can count the poor dregs of our lives almost to a minute.We have just been treated to a lecture , a good quarter of an hour long , from Challenger , who was so excited that he roared and bellowed as if he were addressing his old rows of scientific sceptics in the Queen 's Hall . He had certainly a strange audience to harangue : his wife perfectly acquiescent and absolutely ignorant of his meaning , Summerlee seated in the shadow , querulous and critical but interested , Lord John lounging in a corner somewhat bored by the whole proceeding , and myself beside the window watching the scene with a kind of detached attention , as if it were all a dream or something in which I had no personal interest whatever . Challenger sat at the centre table with the electric light illuminating the slide under the microscope which he had brought from his dressing room . The small vivid circle of white light from the mirror left half of his rugged , bearded face in brilliant radiance and half in deepest shadow . He had , it seems , been working of late upon the lowest forms of life , and what excited him at the present moment was that in the microscopic slide made up the day before he found the amoeba to be still alive . `` You can see it for yourselves , '' he kept repeating in great excitement . `` Summerlee , will you step across and satisfy yourself upon the point ? Malone , will you kindly verify what I say ? The little spindle-shaped things in the centre are diatoms and may be disregarded since they are probably vegetable rather than animal . But the right-hand side you will see an undoubted amoeba , moving sluggishly across the field . The upper screw is the fine adjustment . Look at it for yourselves . `` Summerlee did so and acquiesced . So did I and perceived a little creature which looked as if it were made of ground glass flowing in a sticky way across the lighted circle . Lord John was prepared to take him on trust . `` I 'm not troublin ' my head whether he 's alive or dead , '' said he . `` We do n't so much as know each other by sight , so why should I take it to heart ? I do n't suppose he 's worryin ' himself over the state ofourhealth . `` I laughed at this , and Challenger looked in my direction with his coldest and most supercilious stare . It was a most petrifying experience . `` The flippancy of the half-educated is more obstructive to science than the obtuseness of the ignorant , '' said he . `` If Lord John Roxton would condescend -- -- -- '' '' My dear George , do n't be so peppery , '' said his wife , with her hand on the black mane that drooped over the microscope . `` What can it matter whether the amoeba is alive or not ? `` `` It matters a great deal , '' said Challenger gruffly . `` Well , let 's hear about it , '' said Lord John with a good-humoured smile . `` We may as well talk about that as anything else . If you think I 've been too off-hand with the thing , or hurt its feelin 's in any way , I 'll apologize . `` `` For my part , '' remarked Summerlee in his creaky , argumentative voice , `` I ca n't see why you should attach such importance to the creature being alive . It is in the same atmosphere as ourselves , so naturally the poison does not act upon it . If it were outside of this room it would be dead , like all other animal life . `` `` Your remarks , my good Summerlee , '' said Challenger with enormous condescension ( oh , if I could paint that over-bearing , arrogant face in the vivid circle of reflection from the microscope mirror ! ) -- - '' your remarks show that you imperfectly appreciate the situation . This specimen was mounted yesterday and is hermetically sealed . None of our oxygen can reach it . But the ether , of course , has penetrated to it , as to every other point upon the universe . Therefore , it has survived the poison . Hence , we may argue that every amoeba outside this room , instead of being dead , as you have erroneously stated , has really survived the catastrophe . `` `` Well , even now I do n't feel inclined to hip-hurrah about it , '' said Lord John . `` What does it matter ? `` `` It just matters this , that the world is a living instead of a dead one . If you had the scientific imagination , you would cast your mind forward from this one fact , and you would see some few millions of years hence -- -a mere passing moment in the enormous flux of the ages -- -the whole world teeming once more with the animal and human life which will spring from this tiny root . You have seen a prairie fire where the flames have swept every trace of grass or plant from the surface of the earth and left only a blackened waste . You would think that it must be forever desert . Yet the roots of growth have been left behind , and when you pass the place a few years hence you can no longer tell where the black scars used to be . Here in this tiny creature are the roots of growth of the animal world , and by its inherent development , and evolution , it will surely in time remove every trace of this incomparable crisis in which we are now involved . `` `` Dooced interestin ' ! '' said Lord John , lounging across and looking through the microscope . `` Funny little chap to hang number one among the family portraits . Got a fine big shirt-stud on him ! `` `` The dark object is his nucleus , '' said Challenger with the air of a nurse teaching letters to a baby . `` Well , we need n't feel lonely , '' said Lord John laughing . `` There 's somebody livin ' besides us on the earth . `` `` You seem to take it for granted , Challenger , '' said Summerlee , `` that the object for which this world was created was that it should produce and sustain human life . `` `` Well , sir , and what object do you suggest ? '' asked Challenger , bristling at the least hint of contradiction . `` Sometimes I think that it is only the monstrous conceit of mankind which makes him think that all this stage was erected for him to strut upon . `` `` We can not be dogmatic about it , but at least without what you have ventured to call monstrous conceit we can surely say that we are the highest thing in nature . `` `` The highest of which we have cognizance . `` `` That , sir , goes without saying . `` `` Think of all the millions and possibly billions of years that the earth swung empty through space -- -or , if not empty , at least without a sign or thought of the human race . Think of it , washed by the rain and scorched by the sun and swept by the wind for those unnumbered ages . Man only came into being yesterday so far as geological times goes . Why , then , should it be taken for granted that all this stupendous preparation was for his benefit ? `` `` For whose then -- -or for what ? `` Summerlee shrugged his shoulders . `` How can we tell ? For some reason altogether beyond our conception -- -and man may have been a mere accident , a by-product evolved in the process . It is as if the scum upon the surface of the ocean imagined that the ocean was created in order to produce and sustain it , or a mouse in a cathedral thought that the building was its own proper ordained residence . `` I have jotted down the very words of their argument , but now it degenerates into a mere noisy wrangle with much polysyllabic scientific jargon upon each side . It is no doubt a privilege to hear two such brains discuss the highest questions ; but as they are in perpetual disagreement , plain folk like Lord John and I get little that is positive from the exhibition . They neutralize each other and we are left as they found us . Now the hubbub has ceased , and Summerlee is coiled up in his chair , while Challenger , still fingering the screws of his microscope , is keeping up a continual low , deep , inarticulate growl like the sea after a storm . Lord John comes over to me
