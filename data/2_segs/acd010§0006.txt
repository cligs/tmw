For answer the Professor took a book down from a shelf . `` This is an excellent monograph by my gifted friend , Ray Lankester ! '' said he . `` There is an illustration here which would interest you . Ah , yes , here it is ! The inscription beneath it runs : 'Probable appearance in life of the Jurassic Dinosaur Stegosaurus . The hind leg alone is twice as tall as a full-grown man . ' Well , what do you make of that ? `` He handed me the open book . I started as I looked at the picture . In this reconstructed animal of a dead world there was certainly a very great resemblance to the sketch of the unknown artist . `` That is certainly remarkable , '' said I . `` But you wo n't admit that it is final ? `` `` Surely it might be a coincidence , or this American may have seen a picture of the kind and carried it in his memory . It would be likely to recur to a man in a delirium . `` `` Very good , '' said the Professor , indulgently ; `` we leave it at that . I will now ask you to look at this bone . '' He handed over the one which he had already described as part of the dead man 's possessions . It was about six inches long , and thicker than my thumb , with some indications of dried cartilage at one end of it . `` To what known creature does that bone belong ? '' asked the Professor.I examined it with care and tried to recall some half-forgotten knowledge . `` It might be a very thick human collar-bone , '' I said.My companion waved his hand in contemptuous deprecation . `` The human collar-bone is curved . This is straight . There is a groove upon its surface showing that a great tendon played across it , which could not be the case with a clavicle . `` `` Then I must confess that I do n't know what it is . `` `` You need not be ashamed to expose your ignorance , for I do n't suppose the whole South Kensington staff could give a name to it . '' He took a little bone the size of a bean out of a pill-box . `` So far as I am a judge this human bone is the analogue of the one which you hold in your hand . That will give you some idea of the size of the creature . You will observe from the cartilage that this is no fossil specimen , but recent . What do you say to that ? `` `` Surely in an elephant -- -- -- '' He winced as if in pain. '' Do n't ! Do n't talk of elephants in South America . Even in these days of Board schools -- -- -- '' '' Well , '' I interrupted , `` any large South American animal -- -a tapir , for example . `` `` You may take it , young man , that I am versed in the elements of my business . This is not a conceivable bone either of a tapir or of any other creature known to zoology . It belongs to a very large , a very strong , and , by all analogy , a very fierce animal which exists upon the face of the earth , but has not yet come under the notice of science . You are still unconvinced ? `` `` I am at least deeply interested . `` `` Then your case is not hopeless . I feel that there is reason lurking in you somewhere , so we will patiently grope round for it . We will now leave the dead American and proceed with my narrative . You can imagine that I could hardly come away from the Amazon without probing deeper into the matter . There were indications as to the direction from which the dead traveler had come . Indian legends would alone have been my guide , for I found that rumors of a strange land were common among all the riverine tribes . You have heard , no doubt , of Curupuri ? '' '' Never . `` `` Curupuri is the spirit of the woods , something terrible , something malevolent , something to be avoided . None can describe its shape or nature , but it is a word of terror along the Amazon . Now all tribes agree as to the direction in which Curupuri lives . It was the same direction from which the American had come . Something terrible lay that way . It was my business to find out what it was . `` `` What did you do ? '' My flippancy was all gone . This massive man compelled one 's attention and respect . `` I overcame the extreme reluctance of the natives -- -a reluctance which extends even to talk upon the subject -- -and by judicious persuasion and gifts , aided , I will admit , by some threats of coercion , I got two of them to act as guides . After many adventures which I need not describe , and after traveling a distance which I will not mention , in a direction which I withhold , we came at last to a tract of country which has never been described , nor , indeed , visited save by my unfortunate predecessor . Would you kindly look at this ? `` He handed me a photograph -- -half-plate size . `` The unsatisfactory appearance of it is due to the fact , '' said he , `` that on descending the river the boat was upset and the case which contained the undeveloped films was broken , with disastrous results . Nearly all of them were totally ruined -- -an irreparable loss . This is one of the few which partially escaped . This explanation of deficiencies or abnormalities you will kindly accept . There was talk of faking . I am not in a mood to argue such a point . `` The photograph was certainly very off-colored . An unkind critic might easily have misinterpreted that dim surface . It was a dull gray landscape , and as I gradually deciphered the details of it I realized that it represented a long and enormously high line of cliffs exactly like an immense cataract seen in the distance , with a sloping , tree-clad plain in the foreground . `` I believe it is the same place as the painted picture , '' said I . `` It is the same place , '' the Professor answered . `` I found traces of the fellow 's camp . Now look at this . `` It was a nearer view of the same scene , though the photograph was extremely defective . I could distinctly see the isolated , tree-crowned pinnacle of rock which was detached from the crag . `` I have no doubt of it at all , '' said I . `` Well , that is something gained , '' said he . `` We progress , do we not ? Now , will you please look at the top of that rocky pinnacle ? Do you observe something there ? `` `` An enormous tree . `` `` But on the tree ? `` `` A large bird , '' said I.He handed me a lens . `` Yes , '' I said , peering through it , `` a large bird stands on the tree . It appears to have a considerable beak . I should say it was a pelican . `` `` I can not congratulate you upon your eyesight , '' said the Professor . `` It is not a pelican , nor , indeed , is it a bird . It may interest you to know that I succeeded in shooting that particular specimen . It was the only absolute proof of my experiences which I was able to bring away with me . `` `` You have it , then ? '' Here at last was tangible corroboration . `` I had it . It was unfortunately lost with so much else in the same boat accident which ruined my photographs . I clutched at it as it disappeared in the swirl of the rapids , and part of its wing was left in my hand . I was insensible when washed ashore , but the miserable remnant of my superb specimen was still intact ; I now lay it before you . `` From a drawer he produced what seemed to me to be the upper portion of the wing of a large bat . It was at least two feet in length , a curved bone , with a membranous veil beneath it . `` A monstrous bat ! '' I suggested . `` Nothing of the sort , '' said the Professor , severely . `` Living , as I do , in an educated and scientific atmosphere , I could not have conceived that the first principles of zoology were so little known . Is it possible that you do not know the elementary fact in comparative anatomy , that the wing of a bird is really the forearm , while the wing of a bat consists of three elongated fingers with membranes between ? Now , in this case , the bone is certainly not the forearm , and you can see for yourself that this is a single membrane hanging upon a single bone , and therefore that it can not belong to a bat . But if it is neither bird nor bat , what is it ? `` My small stock of knowledge was exhausted . `` I really do not know , '' said I.He opened the standard work to which he had already referred me . `` Here , '' said he , pointing to the picture of an extraordinary flying monster , `` is an excellent reproduction of the dimorphodon , or pterodactyl , a flying reptile of the Jurassic period . On the next page is a diagram of the mechanism of its wing . Kindly compare it with the specimen in your hand . `` A wave of amazement passed over me as I looked . I was convinced . There could be no getting away from it . The cumulative proof was overwhelming . The sketch , the photographs , the narrative , and now the actual specimen -- -the evidence was complete . I said so -- -I said so warmly , for I felt that the Professor was an ill-used man . He leaned back in his chair with drooping eyelids and a tolerant smile , basking in this sudden gleam of sunshine . `` It 's just the very biggest thing that I ever heard of ! '' said I , though it was my journalistic rather than my scientific enthusiasm that was roused . `` It is colossal . You are a Columbus of science who has discovered a lost world . I 'm awfully sorry if I seemed to doubt you . It was all so unthinkable . But I understand evidence when I see it , and this should be good enough for anyone . `` The Professor purred with satisfaction . `` And then , sir , what did you do next ? `` `` It was the wet season , Mr. Malone , and my stores were exhausted . I explored some portion of this huge cliff , but I was unable to find any way to scale it . The pyramidal rock
