the country might congregate round it ? Oh , you have been very near your death , my fine fellow ! You will never be nearer until your time comes . Look at this ! '' He pulled a squat , thick pistol out of his bosom . `` If you had passed through that gap and set foot on my land I 'd have let daylight into you . I 'll have no vagabonds here . I know how to treat gentry of that sort , whether their faces are black or white . `` `` Sir , '' said I , `` I meant no harm by coming here , and I do not know how I have deserved this extraordinary outburst . Allow me to observe , however , that you are still covering me with your pistol , and that , as your hand is rather tremulous , it is more than possible that it may go off . If you do n't turn the muzzle down I shall be compelled in self-defence to strike you over the wrist with my stick . `` `` What the deuce brought you here , then ? '' he asked , in a more composed voice , putting his weapon back into his bosom . `` Ca n't a gentleman live quietly without your coming to peep and pry ? Have you no business of your own to look after , eh ? And my daughter ? how came you to know anything of her ? and what have you been trying to squeeze out of her ? It was n't chance that brought you here . `` `` No , '' said I boldly , `` it was not chance which brought me here . I have had several opportunities of seeing your daughter and of appreciating her many noble qualities . We are engaged to be married to each other , and I came up with the express intention of seeing her . `` Instead of blazing into a fury , as I had expected , the general gave a long whistle of astonishment , and then leant up against the railings , laughing softly to himself . `` English terriers are fond of nosing worms , '' he remarked at last . `` When we brought them out to India they used to trot off into the jungle and begin sniffing at what they imagined to be worms there . But the worm turned out to be a venomous snake , and so poor doggy played no more . I think you 'll find yourself in a somewhat analogous position if you do n't look out . `` `` You surely do n't mean to cast an aspersion upon your own daughter ? '' I said , flushing with indignation . `` Oh , Gabriel is all right , '' he answered carelessly . `` Our family is not exactly one , however , which I should recommend a young fellow to marry into . And pray how is it that I was not informed of this snug little arrangement of yours ? `` `` We were afraid , sir , that you might separate us , '' I replied , feeling that perfect candour was the best policy under the circumstances . `` It is possible that we were mistaken . Before coming to any final decision , I implore you to remember that the happiness of both of us is at stake . It is in your power to divide our bodies , but our souls shall be for ever united . `` `` My good fellow , '' said the general , in a not unkindly tone , `` you do n't know what you are asking for . There is a gulf between you and any one of the blood of Heatherstone which can never be bridged over . `` All trace of anger had vanished now from his manner , and given place to an air of somewhat contemptuous amusement.My family pride took fire at his words . `` The gulf may be less than you imagine , '' I said coldly . `` We are not clodhoppers because we live in this out-of-the-way place . I am of noble descent on one side , and my mother was a Buchan of Buchan . I assure you that there is no such disparity between us as you seem to imagine . `` `` You misunderstand me , '' the general answered . `` It is on our side that the disparity lies . There are reasons why my daughter Gabriel should live and die single . It would not be to your advantage to marry her . `` `` But surely , sir , '' I persisted , `` I am the best judge of my own interests and advantages . Since you take this ground all becomes easy , for I do assure you that the one interest which overrides all others is that I should have the woman I love for my wife . If this is your only objection to our match you may surely give us your consent , for any danger or trial which I may incur in marrying Gabriel will not weigh with me one featherweight . `` `` Here 's a young bantam ! '' exclaimed the old soldier , smiling at my warmth . `` It 's easy to defy danger when you do n't know what the danger is . `` `` What is it , then ? '' I asked , hotly . `` There is no earthly peril which will drive me from Gabriel 's side . Let me know what it is and test me . `` `` No , no . That would never do , '' he answered with a sigh , and then , thoughtfully , as if speaking his mind aloud : `` He has plenty of pluck and is a well-grown lad , too . We might do worse than make use of him . `` He went on mumbling to himself with a vacant stare in his eyes as if he had forgotten my presence . `` Look here , West , '' he said presently . `` You 'll excuse me if I spoke hastily a little time ago . It is the second time that I have had occasion to apologise to you for the same offence . It sha n't occur again . I am rather over-particular , no doubt , in my desire for complete isolation , but I have good reasons for insisting on the point . Rightly or wrongly , I have got it into my head that some day there might be an organised raid upon my grounds . If anything of the sort should occur I suppose I might reckon upon your assistance ? `` `` With all my heart . `` `` So that if ever you got a message such as 'Come up , ' or even 'Cloomber , ' you would know that it was an appeal for help , and would hurry up immediately , even if it were in the dead of the night ? `` `` Most certainly I should , '' I answered . `` But might I ask you what the nature of the danger is which you apprehend ? `` `` There would be nothing gained by your knowing . Indeed , you would hardly understand it if I told you . I must bid you good day now , for I have stayed with you too long . Remember , I count upon you as one of the Cloomber garrison now . `` `` One other thing , sir , '' I said hurriedly , for he was turning away , `` I hope that you will not be angry with your daughter for anything which I have told you . It was for my sake that she kept it all secret from you . `` `` All right , '' he said , with his cold , inscrutable smile . `` I am not such an ogre in the bosom of my family as you seem to think . As to this marriage question , I should advise you as a friend to let it drop altogether , but if that is impossible I must insist that it stand over completely for the present . It is impossible to say what unexpected turn events may take . Good-bye . `` He plunged into the wood and was quickly out of sight among the dense plantation.Thus ended this extraordinary interview , in which this strange man had begun by pointing a loaded pistol at my breast and had ended , by partially acknowledging the possibility of my becoming his future son-in-law . I hardly knew whether to be cast down or elated over it.On the one hand he was likely , by keeping a closer watch over his daughter , to prevent us from communicating as freely as we had done hitherto . Against this there was the advantage of having obtained an implied consent to the renewal of my suit at some future date . On the whole , I came to the conclusion as I walked thoughtfully home that I had improved my position by the incident.But this danger -- -this shadowy , unspeakable danger -- -which appeared to rise up at every turn , and to hang day and night over the towers of Cloomber ! Rack my brain as I would , I could not conjure up any solution to the problem which was not puerile and inadequate.One fact struck me as being significant . Both the father and the son had assured me , independently of each other , that if I were told what the peril was , I would hardly realise its significance . How strange and bizarre must the fear be which can scarcely be expressed in intelligible language ! I held up my hand in the darkness before I turned to sleep that night , and I swore that no power of man or devil should ever weaken my love for the woman whose pure heart I had had the good fortune to win.In making this statement I have purposely couched it in bald and simple language , for fear I should be accused of colouring my narrative for the sake of effect . If , however , I have told my story with any approach to realism , the reader will understand me when I say that by this time the succession of dramatic incidents which had occurred had arrested my attention and excited my imagination to the exclusion of all minor topics.How could I plod through the dull routine of an agent 's work , or interest myself in the thatch of this tenant 's bothy or the sails of that one 's boat , when my mind was taken up by the chain of events which I have described , and was still busy seeking an explanation for them.Go where I would over the countryside , I could see the square , white tower shooting out from among the trees , and beneath that tower this ill-fated family were watching and waiting , waiting and watching -- -and for what ? That was still the question which stood like an impassable barrier at the end of every train of thought.Regarded merely as an abstract problem , this mystery of the Heatherstone family had a lurid fascination about it , but when the woman whom I loved a thousandfold better than I did myself proved to be so deeply interested in the solution , I felt that it was impossible to turn my thoughts to anything else until it had been finally cleared up.My good father had received a letter from the laird ,
