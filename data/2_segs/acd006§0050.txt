fellow , '' she thought as she watched him , `` he certainly loves me . Ah , Tom , Tom ! had you only been as constant , how happy we should be ! '' She was even prompted sometimes to cheer Ezra up by some kind word or look . This he naturally took to be an encouragement to renew his advances . Perhaps he was not far wrong , for if love be wanting pity is occasionally an excellent substitute.One morning after breakfast the elder Girdlestone called his son aside into the library . `` I 've had a notice , '' he said , `` as to paying up dividends . Our time is short , Ezra . You must bring matters to a head . If you do n't it will be too late . `` `` You must n't pick fruit before it is ripe , '' the other answered moodily . `` You can try if it is ripe , though . If not , you can try again . I think that your chance is a good one . She is alone in the breakfast-room , and the table has been cleared . You can not have a better opening . Go , my son , and may Heaven prosper you ! `` `` Very well . Do you wait in here , and I shall let you know how things go . `` The young man buttoned up his coat , pulled down his cuffs , and walked back into the breakfast-room with a sullen look of resolution upon his dark face.Kate was sitting in a wicker chair by the window , arranging flowers in a vase . The morning sunlight streaming in upon her gave a colour to her pale face and glittered in her heavy coils of chestnut hair . She wore a light pink morning dress which added to the ethereal effect of her lithe beautiful figure . As Ezra entered she looked round and started at sight of his face . Instinctively she knew on what errand he had come . `` You will be late at Fenchurch Street , '' she said , with a constrained smile . `` It is nearly eleven now . `` `` I am not going to the office to-day , '' he answered gravely . `` I am come in here , Kate , to know my fate . You know very well , and must have known for some time back , that I love you . If you 'll marry me you 'll make me a happy man , and I 'll make you a happy woman . I 'm not very eloquent and that sort of thing , but what I say I mean . What have you to say in answer ? '' He leaned his broad hands on the back of a chair as he spoke , and drummed nervously with his fingers.Kate had drooped her head over the flowers , but she looked up at him now with frank , pitying eyes . `` Put this idea out of your head , Ezra , '' she said , in a low but firm voice . `` Believe me , I shall always be grateful to you for the kindness which you have shown me of late . I will be a sister to you , if you will let me , but I can never be more . `` `` And why not ? '' asked Ezra , still leaning over the chair , with an angry light beginning to sparkle in his dark eyes . `` Why can you never be my wife ? `` `` It is so , Ezra . You must not think of it . I am so sorry to grieve you . `` `` You ca n't love me , then , '' cried the young merchant hoarsely . `` Other women before now would have given their eyes to have had me.Do you know that ? `` `` For goodness ' sake , then go back to the others , '' said Kate , half amused and half angry.That suspicion of a smile upon her face was the one thing needed to setEzra 's temper in a blaze . `` You wo n't have me , '' he cried savagely . `` I have n't got the airs and graces of that fellow , I suppose.You have n't got him out of your head , though he is off with anothergirl . `` `` How dare you speak to me so ? '' Kate cried , springing to her feet in honest anger . `` It 's the truth , and you know it , '' returned Ezra , with a sneer . `` Are n't you too proud to be hanging on to a man who does n't want you -- - a man that is a smooth-tongued sneak , with the heart of a rabbit ? `` `` If he were here you would not dare to say so ! '' Kate retorted hotly . `` Would n't I ? '' he snarled fiercely . `` No , you would n't . I do n't believe that he has ever been untrue to me . I believe that you and your father have planned to make me believe it and to keep us apart . `` Heaven knows what it was that suddenly brought this idea most clearly before Kate 's mind . Perhaps it was that Ezra 's face , distorted with passion , gave her some dim perception of the wickedness of which such a nature might be capable . The dark face turned so much darker at her words that she felt a great throb of joy at her heart , and knew that this strange new thought which had flashed upon her was the truth . `` You ca n't deny it , '' she cried , with shining eyes and clenched hands . `` You know that it is true . I shall see him and hear from his own lips what he has to say . He loves me still , and I love him , and have never ceased to love him . `` `` Oh , you do , do you ? '' snarled Ezra , taking a step forward , with a devilish gleam in his eyes . `` Your love may do him very little good . We shall see which of us gets the best of it in the long run . We 'll -- - '' His passion was so furious that he stopped , fairly unable to articulate another word.With a threatening motion of his hands he turned upon his heel and rushed from the room . As he passed it chanced that Flo , Kate 's little Skye terrier , ran across his path . All the brutality of the man 's soul rose up in the instant . He raised his heavy boot , and sent the poor little creature howling and writhing under the sofa , whence it piteously emerged upon three legs , trailing the fourth one behind it . `` The brute ! '' Kate cried , as she fondled the injured animal and poured indignant tears over it . Her gentle soul was so stirred by the cowardly deed that she felt that she could have flown at her late suitor were he still in the room . `` Poor little Flo ! That kick was meant for me in reality , my little pet . Never mind , dear , there are bright days coming , and he has not forgotten me , Flo . I know it ! I know it ! '' The little dog whined sympathetically , and licked its mistress 's hand as though it were looking into its canine future , and could also discern better days ahead.Ezra Girdlestone , fierce and lowering , tramped into the library , and told his father brusquely of the result of his wooing . What occurred in that interview was never known to any third person . The servants , who had some idea that something was afoot , have recorded that at the beginning of the conversation the bass voice of the son and the high raucous tones of the father were heard in loud recrimination and reproach . Then they suddenly sunk into tones so low that there might have been complete silence in the room for all that any one could tell from the passage outside . This whispered conversation may have lasted the greater part of an hour . At the end of it the young merchant departed for the City . It has been remarked that from that time there came a change over both the father and the son -- -a change so subtle that It could hardly be described , though it left its mark upon them both . It was not that the grey , wolfish face of the old man looked even greyer and fiercer , or that the hard , arrogant expression of Ezra deepened into something even more sinister . It was that a shadow hung over both their brows -- -a vague indefinable shadow -- -as of men who carry a thought in their minds on which it is not good to dwell.During that long hour Kate had remained in the breakfast-room , still nursing her injured companion , and very busy with her own thoughts . She was as convinced now that Tom had been true to her as if she had had the assurance from his own lips . Still there was much that was unaccountable -- -much which she was unable to fathom . A vague sense of the wickedness around her depressed and weighed her down . What deep scheme could these men have invented to keep him away from her during these long weeks ? Was he , too , under some delusion , or the victim of some conspiracy ? Whatever had been done was certainly connived at by her guardian . For the first time a true estimate of the character of the elder Girdlestone broke upon her , and she dimly realized that the pious , soft-spoken merchant was more to be dreaded than his brutal son . A shudder ran through her whole frame as , looking up , she saw him standing before her.His appearance was far from reassuring . His hands were clasped behind his back , his head bent forward , and he surveyed her with a most malignant expression upon his face . `` Well done ! '' he said , with a bitter smile . `` Well done ! This is a good morning 's work , Miss Harston . You have repaid your father 's friend for the care he has bestowed upon you . `` `` My only wish is to leave your house , '' cried Kate , with an angry flash in her deep blue eyes . `` You are a cruel , wicked , hypocritical old man . You have deceived me about Mr. Dimsdale . I read it in your son 's face , and now I read it in your own . How could you do it -- -oh , how could you have the heart ? `` John Girdlestone was fairly staggered by this blaze of feminine anger in his demure and obedient ward . `` God knows , '' he said , `` whatever my faults may have been , neglect of you has not been among them . I am not immaculate . Even the just man falleth . If I have endeavoured to wean you from this foolish love affair of yours , it has been entirely because I saw that it was against your own
