have been concentrated upon the mysteries of botany , chemistry , and zoology . During the precious hours that should have been devoted to the mastering of the sub-divisions of the celenterata or the natural orders of endogenous plants , he was expending his energies in endeavouring to recall the words of the song which his cousin had sung the evening before , or to recollect the exact intonation with which she remarked to him that it had been a fine day , or some other equally momentous observation . It follows that , as the day of the examination came round , the student , in his lucid intervals , began to feel anxious for the result . He had known his work fairly well , however , at one time , and with luck he might pull through . He made an energetic attempt to compress a month 's reading into a week , and when the day for the written examination came round he had recovered some of his lost ground . The papers suited him fairly well , and he felt as he left the hall that he had had better fortune than he deserved . Theviva voceordeal was the one , however , which he knew would be most dangerous to him , and he dreaded it accordingly.It was a raw spring morning when his turn came to go up . His father andKate drove round with him to the University gates . `` Keep up your pluck , Tom , '' the old gentleman said . `` Be cool , and have all your wits about you . Do n't lose your head , whatever you do . `` `` I seem to have forgotten the little I ever knew , '' Tom said dolefully , as he trudged up the steps . As he looked back he saw Kate wave her hand to him cheerily , and it gave him fresh heart . `` We shall hope to see you at lunch time , '' his father shouted after him . `` Mind you bring us good news . '' As he spoke the carriage rattled away down the Bridges , and Tom joined the knot of expectant students who were waiting at the door of the great hall.A melancholy group they were , sallow-faced , long-visaged and dolorous , partly from the effects of a long course of study and partly from their present trepidation . It was painful to observe their attempts to appear confident and unconcerned as they glanced round the heavens , as if to observe the state of the weather , or examined with well-feigned archaeological fervour the inscriptions upon the old University walls . Most painful of all was it , when some one , plucking up courage , would venture upon a tiny joke , at which the whole company would gibber in an ostentatious way , as though to show that even in this dire pass the appreciation of humour still remained with them . At times , when any of their number alluded to the examination or detailed the questions which had been propounded to Brown or Baker the day before , the mask of unconcern would be dropped , and the whole assembly would glare eagerly and silently at the speaker . Generally on such occasions matters are made infinitely worse by some Job 's comforter , who creeps about suggesting abstruse questions , and hinting that they represent some examiner 's particular hobby . Such a one came to Dimsdale 's elbow , and quenched the last ray of hope which lingered in the young man 's bosom . `` What do you know about cacodyl ? '' was his impressive question. '' Cacodyl ? '' Tom cried aghast . `` It 's some sort of antediluvian reptile , is n't it ? `` The questioner broke into a sickly smile . `` No , '' he said . `` It 's an organic explosive chemical compound . You 're sure to be asked about cacodyl . Tester 's dead on it . He asks every one how it is prepared . `` Tom , much perturbed at these tidings , was feverishly endeavouring to extract some little information from his companion concerning the compound , when a bell rang abruptly inside the room and a janitor with a red face and a blue slip of paper appeared at the door . `` Dillon , Dimsdale , Douglas , '' this functionary shouted in a very pompous voice , and three unhappy young men filed through the half-opened door into the solemn hall beyond.The scene inside was not calculated to put them at their ease . Three tables , half a dozen yards from each other , were littered with various specimens and scientific instruments , and behind each sat two elderly gentlemen , stern-faced and critical . At one side were stuffed specimens of various small beasts , numerous skeletons and skulls , large jars containing fish and reptiles preserved in spirits of wine , jawbones with great teeth which grinned savagely at the unfortunate candidate , and numerous other zoological relics . The second table was heaped over with a blaze of gorgeous orchids and tropical plants , which looked strangely out of place in the great bleak room . A row of microscopes bristled along the edge . The third was the most appalling of all , for it was bare with the exception of several sheets of paper and a pencil . Chemistry was the most dangerous of the many traps set to ensnare the unwary student . `` Dillon -- -botany ; Dimsdale -- -zoology ; Douglas -- -chemistry , '' the janitor shouted once more , and the candidates moved in front of the respective tables . Tom found himself facing a great spider crab , which appeared to be regarding him with a most malignant expression upon its crustacean features . Behind the crab sat a little professor , whose projecting eyes and crooked arms gave him such a resemblance to the creature in front that the student could not help smiling . `` Sir , '' said a tall , clean-shaven man at the other end of the table , `` be serious . This is no time for levity . `` Tom 's expression after that would have made the fortune of a mute . `` What is this ? '' asked the little professor , handing a small round object to the candidate . `` It is an echinus -- -a sea-urchin , '' Tom said triumphantly . `` Have they any circulation ? '' asked the other examiner . `` A water vascular system . `` `` Describe it . `` Tom started off fluently , but it was no part of the policy of the examiners to allow him to waste the fifteen minutes allotted them in expatiating upon what he knew well . They interrupted him after a few sentences . `` How does this creature walk ? '' asked the crab-like one . `` By means of long tubes which it projects at pleasure . `` `` How do the tubes enable the creature to walk ? `` `` They have suckers on them . `` `` What are the suckers like ? `` `` They are round hollow discs . `` `` Are you sure they are round ? '' asked the other sharply . `` Yes , '' said Tom stoutly , though his ideas on the subject were rather vague . `` `` And how does this sucker act ? '' asked the taller examiner.Tom began to feel that these two men were exhibiting a very unseemly curiosity . There seemed to be no satiating their desire for information . `` It creates a vacuum , '' he cried desperately . `` How does it create a vacuum ? `` `` By the contraction of a muscular pimple in the centre , '' said Tom , in a moment of inspiration . `` And what makes this pimple contract ? `` Tom lost his head , and was about to say `` electricity , '' when he happily checked himself and substituted `` muscular action . `` `` Very good , '' said the examiners , and the student breathed again . The taller one returned to the charge , however , with , `` And this muscle -- -is it composed of striped fibres or non-striped ? `` `` Non-striped , '' shrieked Tom at a venture , and both examiners rubbed their hands and murmured , `` Very good , indeed ! '' at which Tom 's hair began to lie a little flatter , and he ceased to feel as if he were in a Turkish bath . `` How many teeth has a rabbit ? '' the tall man asked suddenly . `` I do n't know , '' the student answered with candour.The two looked triumphantly at one another . `` He does n't know ! '' cried the goggle-eyed one decisively . `` I should recommend you to count them the next time you have one for dinner , '' the other remarked . As this was evidently meant for a joke , Tom had the tact to laugh , and a very gruesome and awe-inspiring laugh it was too.Then the candidate was badgered about the pterodactyl , and concerning the difference in anatomy between a bat and a bird , and about the lamprey , and the cartilaginous fishes , and the amphioxus . All these questions he answered more or less to the satisfaction of the examiners -- -generally less . When at last the little bell tinkled which was the sign for candidates to move on to other tables , the taller man leaned over a list in front of him and marked down upon it the following hieroglyphic : -- - # # # # # `` S . B. -- - . `` This Tom 's sharp eye at once detected , and he departed well pleased , for he knew that the `` S . B . '' meantsatis bene , and as to the minus sign after it , it mattered little to him whether he had done rather more than well or rather less . He had passed in zoology , and that was all which concerned him at present.But there were pitfalls ahead . As he moved to the botany table a grey-bearded examiner waved his hand in the direction of the row of microscopes as an intimation that the student was to look through them and pronounce upon what he saw . Tom seemed to compress his whole soul into his one eye as he glared hopelessly through the tube at what appeared to him to resemble nothing so much as a sheet of ice with the marks of skates upon it . `` Come along , come along ! '' the examiner growled impatiently . Courtesy is conspicuous by its absence in most of the Edinburgh examinations . `` You must pass on to the next one , unless you can offer an opinion . `` This venerable teacher of botany , though naturally a kind-hearted man , was well known as one of the most malignant species of examiners , one of the school which considers such an ordeal in the light of a trial of strength between their pupils and themselves . In his eyes the candidate was endeavouring to pass , and his duty was to endeavour to prevent him , a result which , in a large proportion of cases , he successfully accomplished . `` Hurry on , hurry on ! '' he reiterated fussily . `` It 's a section of a leaf , '' said the student . `` It 's
