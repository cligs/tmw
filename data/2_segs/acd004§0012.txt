the better man . `` `` But the wager ? `` `` I have nought to wager . Come out for the love and the lust of the thing . `` `` Nought to wager ! '' cried the soldier . `` Why , you have that which I covet above all things . It is that big body of thine that I am after . See , now , mon garcon . I have a French feather-bed there , which I have been at pains to keep these years back . I had it at the sacking of Issodun , and the King himself hath not such a bed . If you throw me , it is thine ; but , if I throw you , then you are under a vow to take bow and bill and hie with me to France , there to serve in the White Company as long as we be enrolled . `` `` A fair wager ! '' cried all the travellers , moving back their benches and trestles , so as to give fair field for the wrestlers . `` Then you may bid farewell to your bed , soldier , '' said Hordle John . `` Nay ; I shall keep the bed , and I shall have you to France in spite of your teeth , and you shall live to thank me for it . How shall it be , then , mon enfant ? Collar and elbow , or close-lock , or catch how you can ? `` `` To the devil with your tricks , '' said John , opening and shutting his great red hands . `` Stand forth , and let me clip thee . `` `` Shalt clip me as best you can then , '' quoth the archer , moving out into the open space , and keeping a most wary eye upon his opponent . He had thrown off his green jerkin , and his chest was covered only by a pink silk jupon , or undershirt , cut low in the neck and sleeveless . Hordle John was stripped from his waist upwards , and his huge body , with his great muscles swelling out like the gnarled roots of an oak , towered high above the soldier . The other , however , though near a foot shorter , was a man of great strength ; and there was a gloss upon his white skin which was wanting in the heavier limbs of the renegade monk . He was quick on his feet , too , and skilled at the game ; so that it was clear , from the poise of head and shine of eye , that he counted the chances to be in his favor . It would have been hard that night , through the whole length of England , to set up a finer pair in face of each other.Big John stood waiting in the centre with a sullen , menacing eye , and his red hair in a bristle , while the archer paced lightly and swiftly to the right and the left with crooked knee and hands advanced . Then with a sudden dash , so swift and fierce that the eye could scarce follow it , he flew in upon his man and locked his leg round him . It was a grip that , between men of equal strength , would mean a fall ; but Hordle John tore him off from him as he might a rat , and hurled him across the room , so that his head cracked up against the wooden wall . `` Ma foi ! '' cried the bowman , passing his fingers through his curls , `` you were not far from the feather-bed then , mon gar . A little more and this good hostel would have a new window . `` Nothing daunted , he approached his man once more , but this time with more caution than before . With a quick feint he threw the other off his guard , and then , bounding upon him , threw his legs round his waist and his arms round his bull-neck , in the hope of bearing him to the ground with the sudden shock . With a bellow of rage , Hordle John squeezed him limp in his huge arms ; and then , picking him up , cast him down upon the floor with a force which might well have splintered a bone or two , had not the archer with the most perfect coolness clung to the other 's forearms to break his fall . As it was , he dropped upon his feet and kept his balance , though it sent a jar through his frame which set every joint a-creaking . He bounded back from his perilous foeman ; but the other , heated by the bout , rushed madly after him , and so gave the practised wrestler the very vantage for which he had planned . As big John flung himself upon him , the archer ducked under the great red hands that clutched for him , and , catching his man round the thighs , hurled him over his shoulder -- -helped as much by his own mad rush as by the trained strength of the heave . To Alleyne 's eye , it was as if John had taken unto himself wings and flown . As he hurtled through the air , with giant limbs revolving , the lad 's heart was in his mouth ; for surely no man ever yet had such a fall and came scathless out of it . In truth , hardy as the man was , his neck had been assuredly broken had he not pitched head first on the very midriff of the drunken artist , who was slumbering so peacefully in the corner , all unaware of these stirring doings . The luckless limner , thus suddenly brought out from his dreams , sat up with a piercing yell , while Hordle John bounded back into the circle almost as rapidly as he had left it . `` One more fall , by all the saints ! '' he cried , throwing out his arms . `` Not I , '' quoth the archer , pulling on his clothes , `` I have come well out of the business . I would sooner wrestle with the great bear of Navarre . `` `` It was a trick , '' cried John . `` Aye was it . By my ten finger-bones ! it is a trick that will add a proper man to the ranks of the Company . `` `` Oh , for that , '' said the other , `` I count it not a fly ; for I had promised myself a good hour ago that I should go with thee , since the life seems to be a goodly and proper one . Yet I would fain have had the feather-bed . `` `` I doubt it not , mon ami , '' quoth the archer , going back to his tankard . `` Here is to thee , lad , and may we be good comrades to each other ! But , hola ! what is it that ails our friend of the wrathful face ? `` The unfortunate limner had been sitting up rubbing himself ruefully and staring about with a vacant gaze , which showed that he knew neither where he was nor what had occurred to him . Suddenly , however , a flash of intelligence had come over his sodden features , and he rose and staggered for the door . `` 'Ware the ale ! '' he said in a hoarse whisper , shaking a warning finger at the company . `` Oh , holy Virgin , 'ware the ale ! '' and slapping his hands to his injury , he flitted off into the darkness , amid a shout of laughter , in which the vanquished joined as merrily as the victor . The remaining forester and the two laborers were also ready for the road , and the rest of the company turned to the blankets which Dame Eliza and the maid had laid out for them upon the floor . Alleyne , weary with the unwonted excitements of the day , was soon in a deep slumber broken only by fleeting visions of twittering legs , cursing beggars , black robbers , and the many strange folk whom he had met at the `` Pied Merlin . `` At early dawn the country inn was all alive , for it was rare indeed that an hour of daylight would be wasted at a time when lighting was so scarce and dear . Indeed , early as it was when Dame Eliza began to stir , it seemed that others could be earlier still , for the door was ajar , and the learned student of Cambridge had taken himself off , with a mind which was too intent upon the high things of antiquity to stoop to consider the four-pence which he owed for bed and board . It was the shrill out-cry of the landlady when she found her loss , and the clucking of the hens , which had streamed in through the open door , that first broke in upon the slumbers of the tired wayfarers.Once afoot , it was not long before the company began to disperse . A sleek mule with red trappings was brought round from some neighboring shed for the physician , and he ambled away with much dignity upon his road to Southampton . The tooth-drawer and the gleeman called for a cup of small ale apiece , and started off together for Ringwood fair , the old jongleur looking very yellow in the eye and swollen in the face after his overnight potations . The archer , however , who had drunk more than any man in the room , was as merry as a grig , and having kissed the matron and chased the maid up the ladder once more , he went out to the brook , and came back with the water dripping from his face and hair. '' Hola ! my man of peace , '' he cried to Alleyne , `` whither are you bent this morning ? `` `` To Minstead , '' quoth he . `` My brother Simon Edricson is socman there , and I go to bide with him for a while . I prythee , let me have my score , good dame . `` `` Score , indeed ! '' cried she , standing with upraised hands in front of the panel on which Alleyne had worked the night before . `` Say , rather what it is that I owe to thee , good youth . Aye , this is indeed a pied merlin , and with a leveret under its claws , as I am a living woman . By the rood of Waltham ! but thy touch is deft and dainty . `` `` And see the red eye of it ! '' cried the maid . `` Aye , and the open beak . `` `` And the ruffled wing , '' added Hordle John . `` By my hilt ! '' cried the archer , `` it is the very bird itself . `` The young clerk flushed with pleasure at this chorus of praise , rude and indiscriminate indeed , and yet so much heartier and less grudging than any which he had ever heard from the critical brother Jerome , or the short-spoken Abbot . There was , it would seem , great kindness as well as great wickedness in this world , of
