our awful situation . The full solemnity of the event loomed ever at the back of our minds and tempered our thoughts . But surely it is the soul which has never faced death which shies strongly from it at the end . To each of us men it had , for one great epoch in our lives , been a familiar presence . As to the lady , she leaned upon the strong guidance of her mighty husband and was well content to go whither his path might lead . The future was our fate . The present was our own . We passed it in goodly comradeship and gentle merriment . Our minds were , as I have said , singularly lucid . Even I struck sparks at times . As to Challenger , he was wonderful ! Never have I so realized the elemental greatness of the man , the sweep and power of his understanding . Summerlee drew him on with his chorus of subacid criticism , while Lord John and I laughed at the contest and the lady , her hand upon his sleeve , controlled the bellowings of the philosopher . Life , death , fate , the destiny of man -- -these were the stupendous subjects of that memorable hour , made vital by the fact that as the meal progressed strange , sudden exaltations in my mind and tinglings in my limbs proclaimed that the invisible tide of death was slowly and gently rising around us . Once I saw Lord John put his hand suddenly to his eyes , and once Summerlee dropped back for an instant in his chair . Each breath we breathed was charged with strange forces . And yet our minds were happy and at ease . Presently Austin laid the cigarettes upon the table and was about to withdraw. '' Austin ! '' said his master . `` Yes , sir ? `` `` I thank you for your faithful service . '' A smile stole over the servant 's gnarled face . `` I 've done my duty , sir . `` `` I 'm expecting the end of the world to-day , Austin . `` `` Yes , sir . What time , sir ? `` `` I ca n't say , Austin . Before evening . `` `` Very good , sir . `` The taciturn Austin saluted and withdrew . Challenger lit a cigarette , and , drawing his chair closer to his wife 's , he took her hand in his . `` You know how matters stand , dear , '' said he . `` I have explained it also to our friends here . You 're not afraid are you ? `` `` It wo n't be painful , George ? `` `` No more than laughing-gas at the dentist 's . Every time you have had it you have practically died . `` `` But that is a pleasant sensation . `` `` So may death be . The worn-out bodily machine ca n't record its impression , but we know the mental pleasure which lies in a dream or a trance . Nature may build a beautiful door and hang it with many a gauzy and shimmering curtain to make an entrance to the new life for our wondering souls . In all my probings of the actual , I have always found wisdom and kindness at the core ; and if ever the frightened mortal needs tenderness , it is surely as he makes the passage perilous from life to life . No , Summerlee , I will have none of your materialism , for I , at least , am too great a thing to end in mere physical constituents , a packet of salts and three bucketfuls of water . Here -- -here '' -- -and he beat his great head with his huge , hairy fist -- - '' there is something which uses matter , but is not of it -- -something which might destroy death , but which death can never destroy . `` `` Talkin ' of death , '' said Lord John . `` I 'm a Christian of sorts , but it seems to me there was somethin ' mighty natural in those ancestors of ours who were buried with their axes and bows and arrows and the like , same as if they were livin ' on just the same as they used to . I do n't know , '' he added , looking round the table in a shamefaced way , `` that I would n't feel more homely myself if I was put away with my old .450 Express and the fowlin'-piece , the shorter one with the rubbered stock , and a clip or two of cartridges -- -just a fool 's fancy , of course , but there it is . How does it strike you , Herr Professor ? `` `` Well , '' said Summerlee , `` since you ask my opinion , it strikes me as an indefensible throwback to the Stone Age or before it . I 'm of the twentieth century myself , and would wish to die like a reasonable civilized man . I do n't know that I am more afraid of death than the rest of you , for I am an oldish man , and , come what may , I ca n't have very much longer to live ; but it is all against my nature to sit waiting without a struggle like a sheep for the butcher . Is it quite certain , Challenger , that there is nothing we can do ? `` `` To save us -- -nothing , '' said Challenger . `` To prolong our lives a few hours and thus to see the evolution of this mighty tragedy before we are actually involved in it -- -that may prove to be within my powers . I have taken certain steps -- -- -- '' '' The oxygen ? '' '' Exactly . The oxygen . `` `` But what can oxygen effect in the face of a poisoning of the ether ? There is not a greater difference in quality between a brick-bat and a gas than there is between oxygen and ether . They are different planes of matter . They can not impinge upon one another . Come , Challenger , you could not defend such a proposition . `` `` My good Summerlee , this etheric poison is most certainly influenced by material agents . We see it in the methods and distribution of the outbreak . We should nota priorihave expected it , but it is undoubtedly a fact . Hence I am strongly of opinion that a gas like oxygen , which increases the vitality and the resisting power of the body , would be extremely likely to delay the action of what you have so happily named the daturon . It may be that I am mistaken , but I have every confidence in the correctness of my reasoning . `` `` Well , '' said Lord John , `` if we 've got to sit suckin ' at those tubes like so many babies with their bottles , I 'm not takin ' any . `` `` There will be no need for that , '' Challenger answered . `` We have made arrangements -- -it is to my wife that you chiefly owe it -- -that her boudoir shall be made as airtight as is practicable . With matting and varnished paper . `` `` Good heavens , Challenger , you do n't suppose you can keep out ether with varnished paper ? `` `` Really , my worthy friend , you are a trifle perverse in missing the point . It is not to keep out the ether that we have gone to such trouble . It is to keep in the oxygen . I trust that if we can ensure an atmosphere hyper-oxygenated to a certain point , we may be able to retain our senses . I had two tubes of the gas and you have brought me three more . It is not much , but it is something . `` `` How long will they last ? `` `` I have not an idea . We will not turn them on until our symptoms become unbearable . Then we shall dole the gas out as it is urgently needed . It may give us some hours , possibly even some days , on which we may look out upon a blasted world . Our own fate is delayed to that extent , and we will have the very singular experience , we five , of being , in all probability , the absolute rear guard of the human race upon its march into the unknown . Perhaps you will be kind enough now to give me a hand with the cylinders . It seems to me that the atmosphere already grows somewhat more oppressive . `` The chamber which was destined to be the scene of our unforgettable experience was a charmingly feminine sitting-room , some fourteen or sixteen feet square . At the end of it , divided by a curtain of red velvet , was a small apartment which formed the Professor 's dressing-room . This in turn opened into a large bedroom . The curtain was still hanging , but the boudoir and dressing-room could be taken as one chamber for the purposes of our experiment . One door and the window frame had been plastered round with varnished paper so as to be practically sealed . Above the other door , which opened on to the landing , there hung a fanlight which could be drawn by a cord when some ventilation became absolutely necessary . A large shrub in a tub stood in each corner . `` How to get rid of our excessive carbon dioxide without unduly wasting our oxygen is a delicate and vital question , '' said Challenger , looking round him after the five iron tubes had been laid side by side against the wall . `` With longer time for preparation I could have brought the whole concentrated force of my intelligence to bear more fully upon the problem , but as it is we must do what we can . The shrubs will be of some small service . Two of the oxygen tubes are ready to be turned on at an instant 's notice , so that we can not be taken unawares . At the same time , it would be well not to go far from the room , as the crisis may be a sudden and urgent one . `` There was a broad , low window opening out upon a balcony . The view beyond was the same as that which we had already admired from the study . Looking out , I could see no sign of disorder anywhere . There was a road curving down the side of the hill , under my very eyes . A cab from the station , one of those prehistoric survivals which are only to be found in our country villages , was toiling slowly up the hill . Lower down was a nurse girl wheeling a perambulator and leading a second child by the hand . The blue reeks of smoke from the cottages gave the whole widespread landscape an air of settled order and homely comfort . Nowhere in the blue heaven or on the sunlit earth was there any foreshadowing of a catastrophe . The harvesters were back in the fields once more and the golfers , in pairs and fours , were still streaming round the links . There was so strange a turmoil within
