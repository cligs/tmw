gently rolling country . Alleyne could not but mark that , whereas in Guienne there had been many townlets and few castles , there were now many castles and few houses . On either hand gray walls and square grim keeps peeped out at every few miles from amid the forests while the few villages which they passed were all ringed round with rude walls , which spoke of the constant fear and sudden foray of a wild frontier land . Twice during the morning there came bands of horsemen swooping down upon them from the black gateways of wayside strongholds , with short , stern questions as to whence they came and what their errand . Bands of armed men clanked along the highway , and the few lines of laden mules which carried the merchandise of the trader were guarded by armed varlets , or by archers hired for the service . `` The peace of Bretigny hath not made much change in these parts , '' quoth Sir Nigel , `` for the country is overrun with free companions and masterless men . Yonder towers , between the wood and the hill , mark the town of Cahors , and beyond it is the land of France . But here is a man by the wayside , and as he hath two horses and a squire I make little doubt that he is a knight . I pray you , Alleyne , to give him greeting from me , and to ask him for his titles and coat-armor . It may be that I can relieve him of some vow , or perchance he hath a lady whom he would wish to advance . `` `` Nay , my fair lord , '' said Alleyne , `` these are not horses and a squire , but mules and a varlet . The man is a mercer , for he hath a great bundle beside him . `` `` Now , God 's blessing on your honest English voice ! '' cried the stranger , pricking up his ears at the sound of Alleyne 's words . `` Never have I heard music that was so sweet to mine ear . Come , Watkin lad , throw the bales over Laura 's back ! My heart was nigh broke , for it seemed that I had left all that was English behind me , and that I would never set eyes upon Norwich market square again . '' He was a tall , lusty , middle-aged man with a ruddy face , a brown forked beard shot with gray , and a broad Flanders hat set at the back of his head . His servant , as tall as himself , but gaunt and raw-boned , had swung the bales on the back of one mule , while the merchant mounted upon the other and rode to join the party . It was easy to see , as he approached , from the quality of his dress and the richness of his trappings , that he was a man of some wealth and position . `` Sir knight , '' said he , `` my name is David Micheldene , and I am a burgher and alderman of the good town of Norwich , where I live five doors from the church of Our Lady , as all men know on the banks of Yare . I have here my bales of cloth which I carry to Cahors -- -woe worth the day that ever I started on such an errand ! I crave your gracious protection upon the way for me , my servant , and my mercery ; for I have already had many perilous passages , and have now learned that Roger Club-foot , the robber-knight of Quercy , is out upon the road in front of me . I hereby agree to give you one rose-noble if you bring me safe to the inn of the 'Angel ' in Cahors , the same to be repaid to me or my heirs if any harm come to me or my goods . `` `` By Saint Paul ! '' answered Sir Nigel , `` I should be a sorry knight if I ask pay for standing by a countryman in a strange land . You may ride with me and welcome , Master Micheldene , and your varlet may follow with my archers . `` `` God 's benison upon thy bounty ! '' cried the stranger . `` Should you come to Norwich you may have cause to remember that you have been of service to Alderman Micheldene . It is not very far to Cahors , for surely I see the cathedral towers against the sky-line ; but I have heard much of this Roger Clubfoot , and the more I hear the less do I wish to look upon his face . Oh , but I am sick and weary of it all , and I would give half that I am worth to see my good dame sitting in peace beside me , and to hear the bells of Norwich town . `` `` Your words are strange to me , '' quoth Sir Nigel , `` for you have the appearance of a stout man , and I see that you wear a sword by your side . `` `` Yet it is not my trade , '' answered the merchant . `` I doubt not that if I set you down in my shop at Norwich you might scarce tell fustian from falding , and know little difference between the velvet of Genoa and the three-piled cloth of Bruges . There you might well turn to me for help . But here on a lone roadside , with thick woods and robber-knights , I turn to you , for it is the business to which you have been reared . `` `` There is sooth in what you say , Master Micheldene , '' said Sir Nigel , `` and I trust that we may come upon this Roger Clubfoot , for I have heard that he is a very stout and skilful soldier , and a man from whom much honor is to be gained . `` `` He is a bloody robber , '' said the trader , curtly , `` and I wish I saw him kicking at the end of a halter . `` `` It is such men as he , '' Sir Nigel remarked , `` who give the true knight honorable deeds to do , whereby he may advance himself . `` `` It is such men as he , '' retorted Micheldene , `` who are like rats in a wheat-rick or moths in a woolfels , a harm and a hindrance to all peaceful and honest men . `` `` Yet , if the dangers of the road weigh so heavily upon you , master alderman , it is a great marvel to me that you should venture so far from home . `` `` And sometimes , sir knight , it is a marvel to myself . But I am a man who may grutch and grumble , but when I have set my face to do a thing I will not turn my back upon it until it be done . There is one , Francois Villet , at Cahors , who will send me wine-casks for my cloth-bales , so to Cahors I will go , though all the robber-knights of Christendom were to line the roads like yonder poplars . `` `` Stoutly spoken , master alderman ! But how have you fared hitherto ? `` `` As a lamb fares in a land of wolves . Five times we have had to beg and pray ere we could pass . Twice I have paid toll to the wardens of the road . Three times we have had to draw , and once at La Reolle we stood over our wool-bales , Watkin and I , and we laid about us for as long as a man might chant a litany , slaying one rogue and wounding two others . By God 's coif ! we are men of peace , but we are free English burghers , not to be mishandled either in our country or abroad . Neither lord , baron , knight , or commoner shall have as much as a strike of flax of mine whilst I have strength to wag this sword . `` `` And a passing strange sword it is , '' quoth Sir Nigel . `` What make you , Alleyne , of these black lines which are drawn across the sheath ? `` `` I can not tell what they are , my fair lord . `` `` Nor can I , '' said Ford.The merchant chuckled to himself . `` It was a thought of mine own , '' said he ; `` for the sword was made by Thomas Wilson , the armorer , who is betrothed to my second daughter Margery . Know then that the sheath is one cloth-yard , in length , marked off according to feet and inches to serve me as a measuring wand . It is also of the exact weight of two pounds , so that I may use it in the balance . `` `` By Saint Paul ! '' quoth Sir Nigel , `` it is very clear to me that the sword is like thyself , good alderman , apt either for war or for peace . But I doubt not that even in England you have had much to suffer from the hands of robbers and outlaws . `` `` It was only last Lammastide , sir knight , that I was left for dead near Reading as I journeyed to Winchester fair . Yet I had the rogues up at the court of pie-powder , and they will harm no more peaceful traders . `` `` You travel much then ! `` `` To Winchester , Linn mart , Bristol fair , Stourbridge , and Bartholomew 's in London Town . The rest of the year you may ever find me five doors from the church of Our Lady , where I would from my heart that I was at this moment , for there is no air like Norwich air , and no water like the Yare , nor can all the wines of France compare with the beer of old Sam Yelverton who keeps the 'Dun Cow . ' But , out and alack , here is an evil fruit which hangs upon this chestnut-tree ! `` As he spoke they had ridden round a curve of the road and come upon a great tree which shot one strong brown branch across their path . From the centre of this branch there hung a man , with his head at a horrid slant to his body and his toes just touching the ground . He was naked save for a linen under shirt and pair of woollen drawers . Beside him on a green bank there sat a small man with a solemn face , and a great bundle of papers of all colors thrusting forth from the scrip which lay beside him . He was very richly dressed , with furred robes , a scarlet hood , and wide hanging sleeves lined with flame-colored silk . A great gold chain hung round his neck , and rings glittered from every finger of his hands . On his lap he had a little pile of gold and of silver , which he was dropping , coin by coin , into a plump pouch which hung from his girdle . `` May the saints be with you , good travellers ! ''
