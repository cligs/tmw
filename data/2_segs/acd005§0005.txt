them on , they will need me , and they will find me waiting when they send . I will see the king now , and try if I can not rouse him to play the great monarch there as well as here . Had I but his power in my hands , I should change the world 's history. '' '' Hush ! No treason to the captain of the guard , '' cried De Catinat , laughing , while the stern old soldier strode past him into the king 's presence.A gentleman very richly dressed in black and silver had come up during this short conversation , and advanced , as the door opened , with the assured air of a man whose rights are beyond dispute . Captain de Catinat , however , took a quick step forward , and barred him off from the door . `` I am very sorry , Monsieur de Vivonne , '' said he , `` but you are forbidden the presence . `` `` Forbidden the presence ! I ? You are mad ! '' He stepped back with gray face and staring eyes , one shaking hand half raised in protest , '' I assure you that it is his order . `` `` But it is incredible . It is a mistake . `` `` Very possibly . `` `` Then you will let me past . `` `` My orders leave me no discretion . `` `` If I could have one word with the king . `` `` Unfortunately , monsieur , it is impossible . `` `` Only one word . `` `` It really does not rest with me , monsieur . `` The angry nobleman stamped his foot , and stared at the door as though he had some thoughts of forcing a passage . Then turning on his heel , he hastened away down the corridor with the air of a man who has come to a decision . `` There , now , '' grumbled De Catinat to himself , as he pulled at his thick dark moustache , `` he is off to make some fresh mischief . I 'll have his sister here presently , as like as not , and a pleasant little choice between breaking my orders and making an enemy of her for life . I 'd rather hold Fort Richelieu against the Iroquois than the king 's door against an angry woman . By my faith , here *is* a lady , as I feared ! Ah , Heaven be praised ! it is a friend , and not a foe . Good-morning , Mademoiselle Nanon . `` `` Good-morning , Captain de Catinat . `` The new-comer was a tall , graceful brunette , her fresh face and sparkling black eyes the brighter in contrast with her plain dress . `` I am on guard , you see . I can not talk with you . `` `` I can not remember having asked monsieur to talk with me . `` `` Ah , but you must not pout in that pretty way , or else I can not help talking to you , '' whispered the captain . `` What is this in your hand , then ? `` `` A note from Madame de Maintenon to the king . You will hand it to him , will you not ? `` `` Certainly , mademoiselle . And how is Madame , your mistress ? `` `` Oh , her director has been with her all the morning , and his talk is very , very good ; but it is also very , very sad . We are not very cheerful when Monsieur Godet has been to see us . But I forget monsieur is a Huguenot , and knows nothing of directors . `` `` Oh , but I do not trouble about such differences . I let the Sorbonne and Geneva fight it out between them . Yet a man must stand by his family , you know. '' '' Ah ! if Monsieur could talk to Madame de Maintenon a little ! She would convert him . `` `` I would rather talk to Mademoiselle Nanon , but if -- - '' '' Oh ! '' There was an exclamation , a whisk of dark skirts , and the soubrette had disappeared down a side passage.Along the broad , lighted corridor was gliding a very stately and beautiful lady , tall , graceful , and exceedingly haughty . She was richly clad in a bodice of gold-coloured camlet and a skirt of gray silk trimmed with gold and silver lace . A handkerchief of priceless Genoa point half hid and half revealed her beautiful throat , and was fastened in front by a cluster of pearls , while a rope of the same , each one worth a bourgeois ' income , was coiled in and out through her luxuriant hair . The lady was past her first youth , it is true , but the magnificent curves of her queenly figure , the purity of her complexion , the brightness of her deep-lashed blue eyes and the clear regularity of her features enabled her still to claim to be the most handsome as well as the most sharp-tongued woman in the court of France . So beautiful was her bearing , the carriage of her dainty head upon her proud white neck , and the sweep of her stately walk , that the young officer 's fears were overpowered in his admiration , and he found it hard , as he raised his hand in salute , to retain the firm countenance which his duties demanded . `` Ah , it is Captain de Catinat , '' said Madame de Montespan , with a smile which was more embarrassing to him than any frown could have been . `` Your humble servant , marquise . `` `` I am fortunate in finding a friend here , for there has been some ridiculous mistake this morning . `` `` I am concerned to hear it . `` `` It was about my brother , Monsieur de Vivonne . It is almost too laughable to mention , but he was actually refused admission to thelever . `` `` It was my misfortune to have to refuse him , madame . `` `` You , Captain de Catinat ? And by what right ? '' She had drawn up her superb figure , and her large blue eyes were blazing with indignant astonishment . `` The king 's order , madame . `` `` The king ! Is it likely that the king would cast a public slight upon my family ? From whom had you this preposterous order ? `` `` Direct from the king through Bontems. '' '' Absurd ! Do you think that the king would venture to exclude a Mortemart through the mouth of a valet ? You have been dreaming , captain . `` `` I trust that it may prove so , madame . `` `` But such dreams are not very fortunate to the dreamer . Go , tell the king that I am here , and would have a word with him . `` `` Impossible , madame . `` `` And why ? `` `` I have been forbidden to carry a message . `` `` To carry any message ? `` `` Any from you , madame . `` `` Come , captain , you improve . It only needed this insult to make the thing complete . You may carry a message to the king from any adventuress , from any decayed governess '' -- -she laughed shrilly at her description of her rival -- - '' but none from Francoise de Mortemart , Marquise de Montespan ? `` `` Such are my orders , madame . It pains me deeply to be compelled to carry them out . `` `` You may spare your protestations , captain . You may yet find that you have every reason to be deeply pained . For the last time , do you refuse to carry my message to the king ? `` `` I must , madame . `` `` Then I carry it myself . `` She sprang forward at the door , but he slipped in front of her with outstretched arms . `` For God 's sake , consider yourself , madame ! '' he entreated . `` Other eyes are upon you. '' '' Pah ! Canaille ! '' She glanced at the knot of Switzers , whose sergeant had drawn them off a few paces , and who stood open-eyed , staring at the scene . `` I tell you that Iwillsee the king . `` `` No lady has ever been at the morninglever . `` `` Then I shall be the first . `` `` You will ruin me if you pass . `` `` And none the less , I shall do so . `` The matter looked serious . De Catinat was a man of resource , but for once he was at his wits ' end . Madame de Montespan 's resolution , as it was called in her presence , or effrontery , as it was termed behind her back , was proverbial . If she attempted to force her way , would he venture to use violence upon one who only yesterday had held the fortunes of the whole court in the hollow of her hand , and who , with her beauty , her wit , and her energy , might very well be in the same position to-morrow ? If she passed him , then his future was ruined with the king , who never brooked the smallest deviation from his orders . On the other hand , if he thrust her back , he did that which could never be forgiven , and which would entail some deadly vengeance should she return to power . It was an unpleasant dilemma . But a happy thought flashed into his mind at the very moment when she , with clenched hand and flashing eyes , was on the point of making a fresh attempt to pass him . `` If madame would deign to wait , '' said he soothingly , `` the king will be on his way to the chapel in an instant . `` `` It is not yet time . `` `` I think the hour has just gone . `` `` And why should I wait , like a lackey ? `` `` It is but a moment , madame . `` `` No , I shall not wait . '' She took a step forward towards the door.But the guardsman 's quick ear had caught the sound of moving feet from within , and he knew that he was master of the situation . `` I will take Madame 's message , '' said he . `` Ah , you have recovered your senses ! Go , tell the king that I wish to speak with him . `` He must gain a little time yet . `` Shall I say it through the lord in waiting ? `` `` No ; yourself. '' '' Publicly ? `` `` No , no ; for his private ear . `` `` Shall I give a reason for your request ? `` `` Oh , you madden me ! Say what I have told you , and at once . `` But the young officer 's dilemma was happily over.At that instant the double doors were swung open , and Louis appeared in the opening , strutting forwards on his high-heeled shoes , his stick tapping , his broad skirts flapping , and his courtiers
