food and drink ? Where all this difference then between the ermine cloak and the leathern tunic , if what they cover is the same ? `` `` Aye , Jenkin , '' said another , `` our foeman is under the stole and the vestment as much as under the helmet and plate of proof . We have as much to fear from the tonsure as from the hauberk . Strike at the noble and the priest shrieks , strike at priest and the noble lays his hand upon glaive . They are twin thieves who live upon our labor . `` `` It would take a clever man to live upon thy labor , Hugh , '' remarked one of the foresters , `` seeing that the half of thy time is spent in swilling mead at the 'Pied Merlin . ' '' '' Better that than stealing the deer that thou art placed to guard , like some folk I know . `` `` If you dare open that swine 's mouth against me , '' shouted the woodman , `` I 'll crop your ears for you before the hangman has the doing of it , thou long-jawed lackbrain . `` `` Nay , gentles , gentles ! '' cried Dame Eliza , in a singsong heedless voice , which showed that such bickerings were nightly things among her guests . `` No brawling or brabbling , gentles ! Take heed to the good name of the house . `` `` Besides , if it comes to the cropping of ears , there are other folk who may say their say , '' quoth the third laborer . `` We are all freemen , and I trow that a yeoman 's cudgel is as good as a forester 's knife . By St. Anselm ! it would be an evil day if we had to bend to our master 's servants as well as to our masters . `` `` No man is my master save the King , '' the woodman answered . `` Who is there , save a false traitor , who would refuse to serve the English king ? `` `` I know not about the English king , '' said the man Jenkin . `` What sort of English king is it who can not lay his tongue to a word of English ? You mind last year when he came down to Malwood , with his inner marshal and his outer marshal , his justiciar , his seneschal , and his four and twenty guardsmen . One noontide I was by Franklin Swinton 's gate , when up he rides with a yeoman pricker at his heels . 'Ouvre , ' he cried , 'ouvre , ' or some such word , making signs for me to open the gate ; and then 'Merci , ' as though he were adrad of me . And you talk of an English king ? `` `` I do not marvel at it , '' cried the Cambrig scholar , speaking in the high drawling voice which was common among his class . `` It is not a tongue for men of sweet birth and delicate upbringing . It is a foul , snorting , snarling manner of speech . For myself , I swear by the learned Polycarp that I have most ease with Hebrew , and after that perchance with Arabian . `` `` I will not hear a word said against old King Ned , '' cried Hordle John in a voice like a bull . `` What if he is fond of a bright eye and a saucy face . I know one of his subjects who could match him at that . If he can not speak like an Englishman I trow that he can fight like an Englishman , and he was hammering at the gates of Paris while ale-house topers were grutching and grumbling at home . `` This loud speech , coming from a man of so formidable an appearance , somewhat daunted the disloyal party , and they fell into a sullen silence , which enabled Alleyne to hear something of the talk which was going on in the further corner between the physician , the tooth-drawer and the gleeman . `` A raw rat , '' the man of drugs was saying , `` that is what it is ever my use to order for the plague -- -a raw rat with its paunch cut open . `` `` Might it not be broiled , most learned sir ? '' asked the tooth-drawer . `` A raw rat sounds a most sorry and cheerless dish . `` `` Not to be eaten , '' cried the physician , in high disdain . `` Why should any man eat such a thing ? `` `` Why indeed ? '' asked the gleeman , taking a long drain at his tankard . `` It is to be placed on the sore or swelling . For the rat , mark you , being a foul-living creature , hath a natural drawing or affinity for all foul things , so that the noxious humors pass from the man into the unclean beast . `` `` Would that cure the black death , master ? '' asked Jenkin . `` Aye , truly would it , my fair son . `` `` Then I am right glad that there were none who knew of it . The black death is the best friend that ever the common folk had in England . `` `` How that then ? '' asked Hordle John . `` Why , friend , it is easy to see that you have not worked with your hands or you would not need to ask . When half the folk in the country were dead it was then that the other half could pick and choose who they would work for , and for what wage . That is why I say that the murrain was the best friend that the borel folk ever had . `` `` True , Jenkin , '' said another workman ; `` but it is not all good that is brought by it either . We well know that through it corn-land has been turned into pasture , so that flocks of sheep with perchance a single shepherd wander now where once a hundred men had work and wage . `` `` There is no great harm in that , '' remarked the tooth-drawer , `` for the sheep give many folk their living . There is not only the herd , but the shearer and brander , and then the dresser , the curer , the dyer , the fuller , the webster , the merchant , and a score of others . `` `` If it come to that , '' said one of the foresters , `` the tough meat of them will wear folks teeth out , and there is a trade for the man who can draw them . `` A general laugh followed this sally at the dentist 's expense , in the midst of which the gleeman placed his battered harp upon his knee , and began to pick out a melody upon the frayed strings . `` Elbow room for Floyting Will ! '' cried the woodmen . `` Twang us a merry lilt . `` `` Aye , aye , the 'Lasses of Lancaster , ' '' one suggested . `` Or 'St . Simeon and the Devil . ' '' '' Or the 'Jest of Hendy Tobias . ' '' To all these suggestions the jongleur made no response , but sat with his eye fixed abstractedly upon the ceiling , as one who calls words to his mind . Then , with a sudden sweep across the strings , he broke out into a song so gross and so foul that ere he had finished a verse the pure-minded lad sprang to his feet with the blood tingling in his face . `` How can you sing such things ? '' he cried . `` You , too , an old man who should be an example to others . `` The wayfarers all gazed in the utmost astonishment at the interruption . `` By the holy Dicon of Hampole ! our silent clerk has found his tongue , '' said one of the woodmen . `` What is amiss with the song then ? How has it offended your babyship ? `` `` A milder and better mannered song hath never been heard within these walls , '' cried another . `` What sort of talk is this for a public inn ? `` `` Shall it be a litany , my good clerk ? '' shouted a third ; `` or would a hymn be good enough to serve ? `` The jongleur had put down his harp in high dudgeon . `` Am I to be preached to by a child ? '' he cried , staring across at Alleyne with an inflamed and angry countenance . `` Is a hairless infant to raise his tongue against me , when I have sung in every fair from Tweed to Trent , and have twice been named aloud by the High Court of the Minstrels at Beverley ? I shall sing no more to-night . `` `` Nay , but you will so , '' said one of the laborers . `` Hi , Dame Eliza , bring a stoup of your best to Will to clear his throat . Go forward with thy song , and if our girl-faced clerk does not love it he can take to the road and go whence he came . `` `` Nay , but not too last , '' broke in Hordle John . `` There are two words in this matter . It may be that my little comrade has been over quick in reproof , he having gone early into the cloisters and seen little of the rough ways and words of the world . Yet there is truth in what he says , for , as you know well , the song was not of the cleanest . I shall stand by him , therefore , and he shall neither be put out on the road , nor shall his ears be offended indoors . `` `` Indeed , your high and mighty grace , '' sneered one of the yeomen , `` have you in sooth so ordained ? `` `` By the Virgin ! '' said a second , `` I think that you may both chance to find yourselves upon the road before long . `` `` And so belabored as to be scarce able to crawl along it , '' cried a third . `` Nay , I shall go ! I shall go ! '' said Alleyne hurriedly , as Hordle John began to slowly roll up his sleeve , and bare an arm like a leg of mutton . `` I would not have you brawl about me. '' '' Hush ! lad , '' he whispered , `` I count them not a fly . They may find they have more tow on their distaff than they know how to spin . Stand thou clear and give me space . `` Both the foresters and the laborers had risen from their bench , and Dame Eliza and the travelling doctor had flung themselves between the two parties with soft words and soothing gestures , when the door of the `` Pied Merlin '' was flung violently open , and the attention of the company was drawn from their own quarrel to the new-comer who had burst so unceremoniously upon them.He was a middle-sized man , of most massive
