, fleshy nose , and a powerful chin . He wore neither wig nor powder , but Nature had put her own silvering upon his thick grizzled locks , and the thousand puckers which clustered round the edges of his eyes , or drew at the corners of his mouth , gave a set gravity to his face which needed no device of the barber to increase it . Yet in spite of his mature years , the swift anger with which he had sprung up when the king refused his plaint , and the keen fiery glance which he had shot at the royal court as they filed past him with many a scornful smile and whispered gibe at his expense , all showed that he had still preserved something of the strength and of the spirit of his youth . He was dressed as became his rank , plainly and yet well , in a sad-coloured brown kersey coat with silver-plated buttons , knee-breeches of the same , and white woollen stockings , ending in broad-toed black leather shoes cut across with a great steel buckle . In one hand he carried his low felt hat , trimmed with gold edging , and in the other a little cylinder of paper containing a recital of his wrongs , which he had hoped to leave in the hands of the king 's secretary.His doubts as to what his next step should be were soon resolved for him in a very summary fashion . These were days when , if the Huguenot was not absolutely forbidden in France , he was at least looked upon as a man who existed upon sufferance , and who was unshielded by the laws which protected his Catholic fellow-subjects . For twenty years the stringency of the persecution had increased until there was no weapon which bigotry could employ , short of absolute expulsion , which had not been turned against him . He was impeded in his business , elbowed out of all public employment , his house filled with troops , his children encouraged to rebel against him , and all redress refused him for the insults and assaults to which he was subjected . Every rascal who wished to gratify his personal spite , or to gain favour with his bigoted superiors , might do his worst upon him without fear of the law . Yet , in spite of all , these men clung to the land which disowned them , and , full of the love for their native soil which lies so deep in a Frenchman 's heart , preferred insult and contumely at home to the welcome which would await them beyond the seas . Already , however , the shadow of those days was falling upon them when the choice should no longer be theirs.Two of the king 's big blue-coated guardsmen were on duty at that side of the palace , and had been witnesses to his unsuccessful appeal . Now they tramped across together to where he was standing , and broke brutally into the current of his thoughts . `` Now , Hymn-books , '' said one gruffly , `` get off again about your business . `` `` You 're not a very pretty ornament to the king 's pathway , '' cried the other , with a hideous oath . `` Who are you , to turn up your nose at the king 's religion , curse you ? `` The old Huguenot shot a glance of anger and contempt at them , and was turning to go , when one of them thrust at his ribs with the butt end of his halberd . `` Take that , you dog ! '' he cried . `` Would you dare to look like that at the king 's guard ? `` `` Children of Belial , '' cried the old man , with his hand pressed to his side , `` were I twenty years younger you would not have dared to use me so. '' '' Ha ! you would still spit your venom , would you ? That is enough , Andre ! He has threatened the king 's guard . Let us seize him and drag him to the guard-room . `` The two soldiers dropped their halberds and rushed upon the old man , but , tall and strong as they were , they found it no easy matter to secure him . With his long sinewy arms and his wiry frame , he shook himself clear of them again and again , and it was only when his breath had failed him that the two , torn and panting , were able to twist round his wrists , and so secure him . They had hardly won their pitiful victory , however , before a stern voice and a sword flashing before their eyes , compelled them to release their prisoner once more.It was Captain de Catinat , who , his morning duties over , had strolled out on to the terrace , and had come upon this sudden scene of outrage . At the sight of the old man 's face he gave a violent start , and drawing his sword , had rushed forward with such fury that the two guardsmen not only dropped their victim , but , staggering back from the threatening sword-point , one of them slipped and the other rolled over him , a revolving mass of blue coat and white kersey. '' Villains ! '' roared De Catinat . `` What is the meaning of this ? `` The two had stumbled on to their feet again , very shamefaced and ruffled . `` If you please , captain , '' said one , saluting , `` this is a Huguenot who abused the royal guard . `` `` His petition had been rejected by the king , captain , and yet he refused to go . `` De Catinat was white with fury . `` And so , when a French citizen has come to have a word with the great master of his country , he must be harassed by two Swiss dogs like you ? '' he cried . `` By my faith , we shall soon see about that ! `` He drew a little silver whistle from his pocket , and at the shrill summons an old sergeant and half a dozen soldiers came running from the guard-room . `` Your names ? '' asked the captain sternly . `` Andre Meunier . `` `` And yours ? `` `` Nicholas Klopper . `` `` Sergeant , you will arrest these men , Meunier and Klopper . `` `` Certainly , captain , '' said the sergeant , a dark grizzled old soldier ofConde and Turenne . `` See that they are tried to-day . `` `` And on what charge , captain ? `` `` For assaulting an aged and respected citizen who had come on business to the king . `` `` He was a Huguenot on his own confession , '' cried the culprits together. '' Hum ! '' The sergeant pulled doubtfully at his long moustache . `` Shall we put the charge in that form , captain ? Just as the captain pleases . '' He gave a little shrug of his epauletted shoulders to signify his doubt whether any good could arise from it . `` No , '' said De Catinat , with a sudden happy thought . `` I charge them with laying their halberds down while on duty , and with having their uniforms dirty and disarranged . `` `` That is better , '' answered the sergeant , with the freedom of a privileged veteran . `` Thunder of God , but you have disgraced the guards ! An hour on the wooden horse with a musket at either foot may teach you that halberds were made for a soldier 's hand , and not for the king 's grass-plot . Seize them ! Attention ! Right half turn ! March ! `` And away went the little clump of guardsmen with the sergeant in the rear.The Huguenot had stood in the background , grave and composed , without any sign of exultation , during this sudden reversal of fortune ; but when the soldiers were gone , he and the young officer turned warmly upon each other . `` Amory , I had not hoped to see you ! `` `` Nor I you , uncle . What , in the name of wonder , brings you toVersailles ? `` `` My wrongs , Amory . The hand of the wicked is heavy upon us , and whom can we turn to save only the king ? `` The young officer shook his head . `` The king is at heart a good man , '' said he . `` But he can only see the world through the glasses which are held before him . You have nothing to hope from him . `` `` He spurned me from his presence . `` `` Did he ask your name ? `` `` He did , and I gave it . `` The young guardsman whistled . `` Let us walk to the gate , '' said he . `` By my faith , if my kinsmen are to come and bandy arguments with the king , it may not be long before my company finds itself without its captain . `` `` The king would not couple us together . But indeed , nephew , it is strange to me how you can live in this house of Baal and yet bow down to no false gods . `` `` I keep my belief in my own heart . `` The older man shook his head gravely . `` Your ways lie along a very narrow path , '' said he , `` with temptation and danger ever at your feet . It is hard for you to walk with the Lord , Amory , and yet go hand in hand with the persecutors of His people . `` `` Tut , uncle ! '' said the young man impatiently . `` I am a soldier of the king 's , and I am willing to let the black gown and the white surplice settle these matters between them . Let me live in honour and die in my duty , and I am content to wait to know the rest . `` `` Content , too , to live in palaces , and eat from fine linen , '' said the Huguenot bitterly , `` when the hands of the wicked are heavy upon your kinsfolk , and there is a breaking of phials , and a pouring forth of tribulation , and a wailing and a weeping throughout the land . `` `` What is amiss , then ? '' asked the young soldier , who was somewhat mystified by the scriptural language in use among the French Calvinists of the day . `` Twenty men of Moab have been quartered upon me , with one Dalbert , their captain , who has long been a scourge to Israel . `` `` Captain Claude Dalbert , of the Languedoc Dragoons ? I have already some small score to settle with him . `` `` Ay , and the scattered remnant has also a score against this murderous dog and self-seeking Ziphite . `` `` What has he done , then ? `` `` His men are over my house like moths in a cloth bale . No place is free from them . He sits in the room which should be mine , his great boots on my Spanish leather chairs , his pipe in his mouth , his wine-pot
