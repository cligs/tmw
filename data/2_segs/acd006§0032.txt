exultation.The track from Kimberley to Dutoitspan was a rough one , but the moon was up , and the young merchant found no difficulty in following it . When he reached the summit of the low hill over which the road ran , he saw the lights of the little town sparkling in the valley beneath him . It was ten o'clock before he galloped into the main street , and he saw at a glance that the news had , as he expected , arrived before him . In front of the Griqualand Saloon a great crowd of miners had assembled , who were talking excitedly among themselves . The light of the torches shone down upon herculean figures , glaring shirts , and earnest bearded faces . The whole camp appeared to have assembled there to discuss the situation , and it was evident from their anxious countenances and subdued voices , that they took no light view of it.The instant the young man alighted from his horse he was surrounded by a knot of eager questioners . `` You 've just come from Kimberley , '' they cried . `` What is the truth of it , Mr. Girdlestone ? Let us know the truth of it . `` `` It 's a bad business , my friends , '' he answered , looking around at the ring of inquiring faces . `` I have been reading a full account of it in theCape Argus . They have made a great find in Russia . There seems to be no doubt at all about the matter . `` `` D 'ye think it will send prices down here as much as they say ? `` `` I 'm afraid it will send them very low . I hold a lot of stones myself , and I should be very glad to get rid of them at any price . I fear it will hardly pay you to work your claims now . `` `` And the price of claims will go down ? `` `` Of course it will . `` `` Eh , mister , what 's that ? '' cried a haggard , unkempt little man , pushing his way to the front and catching hold of Ezra 's sleeve to ensure his attention . `` Did ye say it would send the price o ' claims down ? You did n't say that , did you ? Why , in course , it stands to reason that what happened in Roosia could n't make no difference over here . That 's sense , mates , ai n't it ? '' He looked round him appealingly , and laughed a little nervous laugh . `` You try , '' said Ezra coldly . `` If you get one-third of what you gave for your claim you 'll be lucky . Why , man , you do n't suppose we produce diamonds for local consumption . They are for exporting to Europe , and if Europe is already supplied by Russia , where are you to get your market ? `` `` That 's it ? '' cried several voices . `` If you take my advice , '' Ezra continued , `` you 'll get rid of what you have at any loss , for the time may be coming when you 'll get nothing at all . `` `` Now , look at that ! '' cried the little man , throwing out his hands . `` They call me Unlucky Jim , and Unlucky Jim I 'll be to the end of the chapter . Why , boss , me and Sammy Walker has sunk every damned cent we 've got in that claim , the fruit o ' nine years ' hard work , and here you comes ridin ' up as cool as may be , and tells me that it 's all gone for nothing . `` `` Well , there are others who will suffer as well as you , '' said one of the crowd . `` I reckon we 're all hit pretty hard if this is true , '' remarked another . `` I 'm fair sick of it , '' said the little man , passing his grimy hand across his eyes and leaving a black smear as he did so . `` This ai n't the first time -- -no , nor the second -- -that my luck has played me this trick . I 've a mighty good mind to throw up my hand altogether . `` `` Come in and have some whisky , '' said a rough sympathizer , and the unlucky one was hustled in through the rude door of the Griqualand Saloon , there to find such comfort as he might from the multitudinous bottles which adorned the interior of that building . Liquor had lost its efficacy that evening , however , and a dead depression rested over the little town . Nor was it confined to Dutoitspan . All along the diggings the dismal tidings spread with a rapidity which was astonishing . At eleven o'clock there was consternation at Klipdrift . At quarter-past one Hebron was up and aghast at the news . At three in the morning a mounted messenger galloped into Bluejacket , and before daybreak a digger committee was sitting at Delporte 's Hope discussing the situation . So during that eventful night down the whole long line of the Vaal River there was ruin and heartburning and dismay , while five thousand miles away an old gentleman was sleeping calmly and dreamlessly in his comfortable bed , from whose busy brain had emanated all this misery and misfortune.Perhaps the said old gentleman might have slumbered a little less profoundly could he have seen the sight which met his son 's eyes on the following morning . Ezra had passed the night at Dutoitspan , in the hut of a hospitable miner . Having risen in the morning , he was dressing himself in a leisurely , methodical fashion , when his host , who had been inhaling the morning breeze , thrust his head through the window . `` Come out here , Mr. Girdlestone , '' he cried . `` There 's some fun on.One of the boys is dead drunk , and they are carrying him in . `` Ezra pulled on his coat and ran out . A little group of miners were walking slowly up the main street . He and his host were waiting for the procession to pass them with several jocose remarks appropriate to the occasion ready upon their lips , when their eyes fell upon a horrible splotchy red track which marked the road the party had taken . They both ran forward with exclamations and inquiries . `` It 's Jim Stewart , '' said one of the bearers . `` Him that they used to call Unlucky Jim . `` `` What 's up with him ? `` `` He has shot himself through the head . Where d 'ye think we found him ? Slap in the middle o ' his own claim , with his fingers dug into the gravel , as dead as a herring . `` `` He 's a bad plucked 'un to knock under like that , '' Ezra 's companion remarked . `` Yes , '' said the croupier of the saloon gambling table . `` If he 'd waited for another deal he might have held every trump . He was always a soft chap , was Jim , and he was saying last night as how this spoiled the last chance he was ever like to have of seeing his wife and childer in England . He 's blowed a fine clean hole in himself . Would you like to see it , Mr . Girdlestone ? '' The fellow was about to remove the blood-stained handkerchief which covered the dead man 's face , but Ezra recoiled in horror. '' Mr . Girdlestone looks faint like , '' some one observed . `` Yes , '' said Ezra , who was white to his very lips . `` This has upset me rather . I 'll have a drop of brandy . '' As he walked back to the hut , he wondered inwardly whether the incident would have discomposed his father . `` I suppose he would call it part of our commercial finesse , '' he said bitterly to himself . `` However , we have put our hands to the plough , and we must not let homicide stop us . '' So saying , he steadied his nerves with a draught of brandy , and prepared for the labours of the day.The crisis at the African fields was even more acute than had been anticipated by the conspirators . Nothing approaching to it had ever been known in South Africa before . Diamonds went steadily down in value until they were selling at a price which no dealer would have believed possible , and the sale of claims reached such a climax that men were glad to get rid of them for the mere price of the plant and machinery erected at them . The offices of the various dealers at Kimberley were besieged night and day by an importunate crowd of miners , who were willing to sell at any price in order to save something from the general ruin which they imagined was about to come upon the industry . Some , more long-headed or more desperate than their neighbours , continued to work their claims and to keep the stones which they found until prices might be better . As fresh mails came from the Cape , however , each confirming and amplifying the ominous news , these independent workers grew fewer and more faint-hearted , for their boys had to be paid each week , and where was the money to come from with which to pay them ? The dealers , too , began to take the alarm , and the most tempting offers would hardly induce them to give hard cash in exchange for stones which might prove to be a drug in the market . Everywhere there was misery and stagnation.Ezra Girdlestone was not slow to take advantage of this state of things , but he was too cunning to do so in a manner which might call attention to himself or his movements . In his wanderings he had come across an outcast named Farintosh , a man who had once been a clergyman and a master of arts of Trinity College , Dublin , but who was now a broken-down gambler with a slender purse and a still more slender conscience . He still retained a plausible manner and an engaging address , and these qualities first recommended him to the notice of the young merchant . A couple of days after the receipt of the news from Europe , Ezra sent for this fellow and sat with him for some time on the verandah of the hotel , talking over the situation . `` You see , Farintosh , '' he remarked , `` it might be a false alarm , might it not ? `` The ex-clergyman nodded . He was a man of few words . `` If it should be , it would be an excellent thing for those who buy now . `` Farintosh nodded once again . `` Of course , '' Ezra continued , `` it looks as if the thing was beyond all doubt . My experience has taught me , however , that there is nothing so uncertain as a certainty . That 's what makes me think of speculating over this . If I lose it wo n't hurt
