is an invalid lady , sir . Her husband was once mayor of Gloucester . She always comes to us when she is in town . `` `` Thank you ; I am afraid I can not claim her acquaintance . We have established a most important fact by these questions , Watson , '' he continued in a low voice as we went upstairs together . `` We know now that the people who are so interested in our friend have not settled down in his own hotel . That means that while they are , as we have seen , very anxious to watch him , they are equally anxious that he should not see them . Now , this is a most suggestive fact . `` `` What does it suggest ? `` `` It suggests -- -halloa , my dear fellow , what on earth is the matter ? `` As we came round the top of the stairs we had run up against Sir Henry Baskerville himself . His face was flushed with anger , and he held an old and dusty boot in one of his hands . So furious was he that he was hardly articulate , and when he did speak it was in a much broader and more Western dialect than any which we had heard from him in the morning . `` Seems to me they are playing me for a sucker in this hotel , '' he cried . `` They 'll find they 've started in to monkey with the wrong man unless they are careful . By thunder , if that chap ca n't find my missing boot there will be trouble . I can take a joke with the best , Mr. Holmes , but they 've got a bit over the mark this time . `` `` Still looking for your boot ? `` `` Yes , sir , and mean to find it . `` `` But , surely , you said that it was a new brown boot ? `` `` So it was , sir . And now it 's an old black one. '' '' What ! you do n't mean to say -- - ? `` `` That 's just what I do mean to say . I only had three pairs in the world -- -the new brown , the old black , and the patent leathers , which I am wearing . Last night they took one of my brown ones , and today they have sneaked one of the black . Well , have you got it ? Speak out , man , and do n't stand staring ! `` An agitated German waiter had appeared upon the scene . `` No , sir ; I have made inquiry all over the hotel , but I can hear no word of it . `` `` Well , either that boot comes back before sundown or I 'll see the manager and tell him that I go right straight out of this hotel . `` `` It shall be found , sir -- -I promise you that if you will have a little patience it will be found . `` `` Mind it is , for it 's the last thing of mine that I 'll lose in this den of thieves . Well , well , Mr. Holmes , you 'll excuse my troubling you about such a trifle -- - '' '' I think it 's well worth troubling about . `` `` Why , you look very serious over it . `` `` How do you explain it ? `` `` I just do n't attempt to explain it . It seems the very maddest , queerest thing that ever happened to me . `` `` The queerest perhaps -- - '' said Holmes thoughtfully . `` What do you make of it yourself ? `` `` Well , I do n't profess to understand it yet . This case of yours is very complex , Sir Henry . When taken in conjunction with your uncle 's death I am not sure that of all the five hundred cases of capital importance which I have handled there is one which cuts so deep . But we hold several threads in our hands , and the odds are that one or other of them guides us to the truth . We may waste time in following the wrong one , but sooner or later we must come upon the right . `` We had a pleasant luncheon in which little was said of the business which had brought us together . It was in the private sitting-room to which we afterwards repaired that Holmes asked Baskerville what were his intentions . `` To go to Baskerville Hall . `` `` And when ? `` `` At the end of the week . `` `` On the whole , '' said Holmes , `` I think that your decision is a wise one . I have ample evidence that you are being dogged in London , and amid the millions of this great city it is difficult to discover who these people are or what their object can be . If their intentions are evil they might do you a mischief , and we should be powerless to prevent it . You did not know , Dr. Mortimer , that you were followed this morning from my house ? '' Dr . Mortimer started violently . `` Followed ! By whom ? `` `` That , unfortunately , is what I can not tell you . Have you among your neighbours or acquaintances on Dartmoor any man with a black , full beard ? `` `` No -- -or , let me see -- -why , yes . Barrymore , Sir Charles 's butler , is a man with a full , black beard. '' '' Ha ! Where is Barrymore ? `` `` He is in charge of the Hall . `` `` We had best ascertain if he is really there , or if by any possibility he might be in London . `` `` How can you do that ? `` `` Give me a telegraph form . 'Is all ready for Sir Henry ? ' That will do . Address to Mr. Barrymore , Baskerville Hall . What is the nearest telegraph-office ? Grimpen . Very good , we will send a second wire to the postmaster , Grimpen : 'Telegram to Mr. Barrymore to be delivered into his own hand . If absent , please return wire to Sir Henry Baskerville , Northumberland Hotel . ' That should let us know before evening whether Barrymore is at his post in Devonshire or not . `` `` That 's so , '' said Baskerville . `` By the way , Dr. Mortimer , who is this Barrymore , anyhow ? `` `` He is the son of the old caretaker , who is dead . They have looked after the Hall for four generations now . So far as I know , he and his wife are as respectable a couple as any in the county . `` `` At the same time , '' said Baskerville , `` it 's clear enough that so long as there are none of the family at the Hall these people have a mighty fine home and nothing to do . `` `` That is true . `` `` Did Barrymore profit at all by Sir Charles 's will ? '' asked Holmes . `` He and his wife had five hundred pounds each. '' '' Ha ! Did they know that they would receive this ? `` `` Yes ; Sir Charles was very fond of talking about the provisions of his will . `` `` That is very interesting . `` `` I hope , '' said Dr. Mortimer , `` that you do not look with suspicious eyes upon everyone who received a legacy from Sir Charles , for I also had a thousand pounds left to me. '' '' Indeed ! And anyone else ? `` `` There were many insignificant sums to individuals , and a large number of public charities . The residue all went to Sir Henry . `` `` And how much was the residue ? `` `` Seven hundred and forty thousand pounds . `` Holmes raised his eyebrows in surprise . `` I had no idea that so gigantic a sum was involved , '' said he . `` Sir Charles had the reputation of being rich , but we did not know how very rich he was until we came to examine his securities . The total value of the estate was close on to a million . `` `` Dear me ! It is a stake for which a man might well play a desperate game . And one more question , Dr. Mortimer . Supposing that anything happened to our young friend here -- -you will forgive the unpleasant hypothesis ! -- -who would inherit the estate ? `` `` Since Rodger Baskerville , Sir Charles 's younger brother died unmarried , the estate would descend to the Desmonds , who are distant cousins . James Desmond is an elderly clergyman in Westmoreland . `` `` Thank you . These details are all of great interest . Have you met Mr. James Desmond ? `` `` Yes ; he once came down to visit Sir Charles . He is a man of venerable appearance and of saintly life . I remember that he refused to accept any settlement from Sir Charles , though he pressed it upon him . `` `` And this man of simple tastes would be the heir to Sir Charles 's thousands . `` `` He would be the heir to the estate because that is entailed . He would also be the heir to the money unless it were willed otherwise by the present owner , who can , of course , do what he likes with it . `` `` And have you made your will , Sir Henry ? `` `` No , Mr. Holmes , I have not . I 've had no time , for it was only yesterday that I learned how matters stood . But in any case I feel that the money should go with the title and estate . That was my poor uncle 's idea . How is the owner going to restore the glories of the Baskervilles if he has not money enough to keep up the property ? House , land , and dollars must go together . `` `` Quite so . Well , Sir Henry , I am of one mind with you as to the advisability of your going down to Devonshire without delay . There is only one provision which I must make . You certainly must not go alone. '' '' Dr . Mortimer returns with me . `` `` But Dr. Mortimer has his practice to attend to , and his house is miles away from yours . With all the goodwill in the world he may be unable to help you . No , Sir Henry , you must take with you someone , a trusty man , who will be always by your side . `` `` Is it possible that you could come yourself , Mr . Holmes ? `` `` If matters came to a crisis I should endeavour to be present in person ; but you can understand that , with my extensive consulting practice and with the constant appeals which reach me from many quarters , it is impossible for me to be absent from London for an indefinite time . At the present instant one of the most revered names in England is being
