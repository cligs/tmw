with my knife ; but when I got the bar out of the grate , I managed faster . I 'll put this one back now , or some of those folks down below may notice that we have got it loose . `` `` Are they all loose ? `` `` Only the one at present , but we 'll get the other two out during the night . You can take that bar out and work with it , while I use my own picker at the other . You see , the stone is soft , and by grinding it you soon make a groove along which you can slip the bar . It will be mighty queer if we ca n't clear a road for ourselves before morning . `` `` Well , but even if we could get out into the courtyard , where could we turn to then ? `` `` One thing at a time , friend . You might as well stick at the Kennebec because you could not see how you would cross the Penobscot . Anyway , there is more air in the yard than in here , and when the window is clear we shall soon plan out the rest . `` The two comrades did not dare to do any work during the day , for fear they should be surprised by the jailer , or observed from without . No one came near them , but they ate their loaves and drank their water with the appetite of men who had often known what it was to be without even such simple food as that . The instant that night fell they were both up upon the pegs , grinding away at the hard stone and tugging at the bars . It was a rainy night , and there was a sharp thunder-storm , but they could see very well , while the shadow of the arched window prevented their being seen . Before midnight they had loosened one bar , and the other was just beginning to give , when some slight noise made them turn their heads , and there was their jailer standing , open-mouthed in the middle of the cell , staring up at them.It was De Catinat who observed him first , and he sprang down at him in an instant with his bar ; but at his movement the man rushed for the door , and drew it after him just as the American 's tool whizzed past his ear and down the passage . As the door slammed , the two comrades looked at each other . The guardsman shrugged his shoulders and the other whistled . `` It is scarce worth while to go on , '' said De Catinat . `` We may as well be doing that as anything else . If my picker had been an inch lower I 'd have had him . Well , maybe he 'll get a stroke , or break his neck down those stairs . I 've nothing to work with now , but a few rubs with your bar will finish the job . Ah , dear ! You are right , and we are fairly treed ! `` A great bell had begun to ring in the chateau , and there was a loud buzz of voices and a clatter of feet upon the stones . Hoarse orders were shouted , and there was the sound of turning keys . All this coming suddenly in the midst of the stillness of the night showed only too certainly that the alarm had been given . Amos Green threw himself down in the straw , with his hands in his pockets , and De Catinat leaned sulkily against the wall , waiting for whatever might come to him . Five minutes passed , however , and yet another five minutes , without anyone appearing . The hubbub in the courtyard continued , but there was no sound in the corridor which led to their cell . `` Well , I 'll have that bar out , after all , '' said the American at last , rising and stepping over to the window . `` Anyhow , we 'll see what all this caterwauling is about . '' He climbed up on his pegs as he spoke , and peeped out . `` Come up ! '' he cried excitedly to his comrade . `` They 've got some other game going on here , and they are all a deal too busy to bother their heads about us . `` De Catinat clambered up beside him , and the two stood staring down into the courtyard . A brazier had been lit at each corner , and the place was thronged with men , many of whom carried torches . The yellow glare played fitfully over the grim gray walls , flickering up sometimes until the highest turrets shone golden against the black sky , and then , as the wind caught them , dying away until they scarce threw a glow upon the cheek of their bearer . The main gate was open , and a carriage , which had apparently just driven in , was standing at a small door immediately in front of their window . The wheels and sides were brown with mud , and the two horses were reeking and heavy-headed , as though their journey had been both swift and long . A man wearing a plumed hat and enveloped in a riding-coat had stepped from the carriage , and then , turning round , had dragged a second person out after him . There was a scuffle , a cry , a push , and the two figures had vanished through the door . As it closed , the carriage drove away , the torches and braziers were extinguished , the main gate was closed once more , and all was as quiet as before this sudden interruption. '' Well ! '' gasped De Catinat . `` Is this another king 's messenger they 've got ? `` `` There will be lodgings for two more here in a short time , '' said AmosGreen . `` If they only leave us alone , this cell wo n't hold us long . `` `` I wonder where that jailer has gone ? `` `` He may go where he likes , as long as he keeps away from here . Give me your bar again . This thing is giving . It wo n't take us long to have it out . '' He set to work furiously , trying to deepen the groove in the stone , through which he hoped to drag the staple . Suddenly he ceased , and strained his ears . `` By thunder ! '' said he , `` there 's some one working on the other side . `` They both stood listening . There were the thud of hammers , the rasping of a saw , and the clatter of wood from the other side of the wall . `` What can they be doing ? `` `` I ca n't think . `` `` Can you see them ? `` `` They are too near the wall . `` `` I think I can manage , '' said De Catinat . `` I am slighter than you . '' He pushed his head and neck and half of one shoulder through the gap between the bars , and there he remained until his friend thought that perhaps he had stuck , and pulled at his legs to extricate him . He writhed back , however , without any difficulty . `` They are building something , '' he whispered. '' Building ! `` `` Yes ; there are four of them , with a lantern . `` `` What can they be building , then ? `` `` It 's a shed , I think . I can see four sockets in the ground , and they are fixing four uprights into them . `` `` Well , we ca n't get away as long as there are four men just under our window. '' '' Impossible . `` `` But we may as well finish our work , for all that . '' The gentle scrapings of his iron were drowned amid the noise which swelled ever louder from without . The bar loosened at the end , and he drew it slowly towards him . At that instant , however , just as he was disengaging it , a round head appeared between him and the moonlight , a head with a great shock of tangled hair and a woollen cap upon the top of it . So astonished was Amos Green at the sudden apparition that he let go his grip upon the bar , which , falling outwards , toppled over the edge of the window-sill . `` You great fool ! '' shrieked a voice from below , `` are your fingers ever to be thumbs , then , that you should fumble your tools so ? A thousand thunders of heaven ! You have broken my shoulder . `` `` What is it , then ? '' cried the other . `` My faith , Pierre , if your fingers went as fast as your tongue , you would be the first joiner in France . `` `` What is it , you ape ! You have dropped your tool upon me. '' '' I ! I have dropped nothing. '' '' Idiot ! Would you have me believe that iron falls from the sky ? I say that you have struck me , you foolish , clumsy-fingered lout . `` `` I have not struck you yet , '' cried the other , `` but , by the Virgin , if I have more of this I will come down the ladder to you ! `` `` Silence , you good-for-naughts ! '' said a third voice sternly . `` If the work be not done by daybreak , there will be a heavy reckoning for somebody . `` And again the steady hammering and sawing went forward . The head still passed and repassed , its owner walking apparently upon some platform which they had constructed beneath their window , but never giving a glance or a thought to the black square opening beside him . It was early morning , and the first cold light was beginning to steal over the courtyard , before the work was at last finished and the workmen had left . Then at last the prisoners dared to climb up and to see what it was which had been constructed during the night . It gave them a catch of the breath as they looked at it . It was a scaffold.There it lay , the ill-omened platform of dark greasy boards newly fastened together , but evidently used often before for the same purpose . It was buttressed up against their wall , and extended a clear twenty feet out , with a broad wooden stair leading down from the further side . In the centre stood a headsman 's block , all haggled at the top , and smeared with rust-coloured stains . `` I think it is time that we left , '' said Amos Green . `` Our work is all in vain , Amos , '' said De Catinat sadly . `` Whatever our fate may be -- -and this looks ill enough -- -we can but submit to it like brave men . `` `` Tut , man ; the window is clear ! Let us make a rush for it . `` `` It is useless . I can see a line
