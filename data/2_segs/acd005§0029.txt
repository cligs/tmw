woodland , and the towers of castles pricking out from above the groves . A heavy bell was ringing in some monastery , and its dull booming came and went with the breeze . On the left , but far away , lay the glimmer of Paris . They were leaving it rapidly behind . Whatever his destination , it was neither the capital nor Versailles . Then he began to count the chances of escape . His sword had been removed , and his pistols were still in the holsters beside his unfortunate horse . He was unarmed , then , even if he could free himself , and his captors were at least a dozen in number . There were three on ahead , riding abreast along the white , moonlit road . Then there was one on each side , and he should judge by the clatter of hoofs that there could not be fewer than half a dozen behind . That would make exactly twelve , including the coachman , too many , surely , for an unarmed man to hope to baffle . At the thought of the coachman he had glanced through the glass front at the broad back of the man , and he had suddenly , in the glimmer of the carriage lamp , observed something which struck him with horror.The man was evidently desperately wounded . It was strange indeed that he could still sit there and flick his whip with so terrible an injury . In the back of his great red coat , just under the left shoulder-blade , was a gash in the cloth , where some weapon had passed , and all round was a wide patch of dark scarlet which told its own tale . Nor was this all . As he raised his whip , the moonlight shone upon his hand , and De Catinat saw with a shudder that it also was splashed and clogged with blood . The guardsman craned his neck to catch a glimpse of the man 's face ; but his broad-brimmed hat was drawn low , and the high collar of his driving-coat was raised , so that his features were in the shadow . This silent man in front of him , with the horrible marks upon his person , sent a chill to De Catinat 's valiant heart , and he muttered over one of Marot 's Huguenot psalms ; for who but the foul fiend himself would drive a coach with those crimsoned hands and with a sword driven through his body ? And now they had come to a spot where the main road ran onwards , but a smaller side track wound away down the steep slope of a hill , and so in the direction of the Seine . The advance-guard had kept to the main road , and the two horsemen on either side were trotting in the same direction , when , to De Catinat 's amazement , the carriage suddenly swerved to one side , and in an instant plunged down the steep incline , the two stout horses galloping at their topmost speed , the coachman standing up and lashing furiously at them , and the clumsy old vehicle bounding along in a way which threw him backwards and forwards from one seat to the other . Behind him he could hear a shout of consternation from the escort , and then the rush of galloping hoofs . Away they flew , the roadside poplars dancing past at either window , the horses thundering along with their stomachs to the earth , and that demon driver still waving those horrible red hands in the moonlight and screaming out to the maddened steeds . Sometimes the carriage jolted one way , sometimes another , swaying furiously , and running on two side wheels as though it must every instant go over . And yet , fast as they went , their pursuers went faster still . The rattle of their hoofs was at their very backs , and suddenly at one of the windows there came into view the red , distended nostrils of a horse . Slowly it drew forward , the muzzle , the eye , the ears , the mane , coming into sight as the rider still gained upon them , and then above them the fierce face of Despard and the gleam of a brass pistol barrel . `` At the horse , Despard , at the horse ! '' cried an authoritative voice from behind.The pistol flashed , and the coach lurched over as one of the horses gave a convulsive spring . But the driver still shrieked and lashed with his whip , while the carriage bounded onwards.But now the road turned a sudden curve , and there , right in front of them , not a hundred paces away , was the Seine , running cold and still in the moonshine . The bank on either side of the highway ran straight down without any break to the water 's edge . There was no sign of a bridge , and a black shadow in the centre of the stream showed where the ferry-boat was returning after conveying some belated travellers across . The driver never hesitated , but gathering up the reins , he urged the frightened creatures into the river . They hesitated , however , when they first felt the cold water about their hocks , and even as they did so one of them , with a low moan , fell over upon her side . Despard 's bullet had found its mark . Like a flash the coachman hurled himself from the box and plunged into the stream ; but the pursuing horsemen were all round him before this , and half-a-dozen hands had seized him ere he could reach deep water , and had dragged him to the bank . His broad hat had been struck off in the struggle , and De Catinat saw his face in the moonshine . Great heavens ! It was Amos Green.The desperadoes were as much astonished as was De Catinat when they found that they had recaptured in this extraordinary manner the messenger whom they had given up for lost . A volley of oaths and exclamations broke from them , as , on tearing off the huge red coat of the coachman , they disclosed the sombre dress of the young American . `` A thousand thunders ! '' cried one . `` And this is the man whom that devil 's brat Latour would make out to be dead ! `` `` And how came he here ? `` `` And where is Etienne Arnaud ? `` `` He has stabbed Etienne . See the great cut in the coat ! `` `` Ay ; and see the colour of his hand ! He has stabbed him , and taken his coat and hat. '' '' What ! while we were all within stone 's cast ! `` `` Ay ; there is no other way out of it . `` `` By my soul ! '' cried old Despard , `` I had never much love for old Etienne , but I have emptied a cup of wine with him before now , and I shall see that he has justice . Let us cast these reins round the fellow 's neck and hang him upon this tree . `` Several pairs of hands were already unbuckling the harness of the dead horse , when De Vivonne pushed his way into the little group , and with a few curt words checked their intended violence . `` It is as much as your lives are worth to touch him , '' said he . `` But he has slain Etienne Arnaud . `` `` That score may be settled afterwards . To-night he is the king 's messenger . Is the other all safe ? `` `` Yes , he is here . `` `` Tie this man , and put him in beside him . Unbuckle the traces of the dead horse . So ! Now , De Carnac , put your own into the harness . You can mount the box and drive , for we have not very far to go . `` The changes were rapidly made ; Amos Green was thrust in beside De Catinat , and the carriage was soon toiling up the steep incline which it had come down so precipitately . The American had said not a word since his capture , and had remained absolutely stolid , with his hands crossed over his chest whilst his fate was under discussion . Now that he was alone once more with his comrade , however , he frowned and muttered like a man who feels that fortune has used him badly . `` Those infernal horses ! '' he grumbled . `` Why , an American horse would have taken to the water like a duck . Many a time have I swum my old stallion Sagamore across the Hudson . Once over the river , we should have had a clear lead to Paris . `` `` My dear friend , '' cried De Catinat , laying his manacled hands upon those of his comrade , `` can you forgive me for speaking as I did upon the way from Versailles ? `` `` Tut , man ! I never gave it a thought . `` `` You were right a thousand times , and I was , as you said , a fool -- -a blind , obstinate fool . How nobly you have stood by me ! But how came you there ? Never in my life have I been so astonished as when I saw your face . `` Amos Green chuckled to himself . `` I thought that maybe it would be a surprise to you if you knew who was driving you , '' said he . `` When I was thrown from my horse I lay quiet , partly because I wanted to get a grip of my breath , and partly because it seemed to me to be more healthy to lie than to stand with all those swords clinking in my ears . Then they all got round you , and I rolled into the ditch , crept along it , got on the cross-road in the shadow of the trees , and was beside the carriage before ever they knew that I was gone . I saw in a flash that there was only one way by which I could be of use to you . The coachman was leaning round with his head turned to see what was going on behind him . I out with my knife , sprang up on the front wheel , and stopped his tongue forever. '' '' What ! without a sound ! `` `` I have not lived among the Indians for nothing . `` `` And then ? `` `` I pulled him down into the ditch , and I got into his coat and his hat.I did not scalp him . `` `` Scalp him ? Great heavens ! Such things are only done among savages. '' '' Ah ! I thought that maybe it was not the custom of the country . I am glad now that I did not do it . I had hardly got the reins before they were all back and bundled you into the coach . I was not afraid of their seeing me , but I was scared lest I should not know which road to take , and so set them on the trail . But they made it easy to me by sending some of their riders in front ,
