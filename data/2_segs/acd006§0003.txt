The little man tapped him with his walking-stick over the cardiac region and laughed boisterously , while his grim companion smiled slightly and bowed to the compliment . `` I 've come here begging , '' said Mr. Jefferson Edwards , producing a portentous-looking roll of paper from an inner pocket . `` Know I 've come to the right place for charity . The Aboriginal Evolution Society , my dear boy . All it wants are a few hundreds to float it off . Noble aim , Girdlestone -- -glorious object . `` `` What *is* the object ? '' the merchant asked . `` Well , the evolution of the aborigines , '' Edwards answered in some confusion . `` Sort of practical Darwinism . Evolve 'em into higher types , and turn 'em all white in time . Professor Wilder gave us a lecture about it . I 'll send you round aTimeswith the account . Spoke about their thumbs . They ca n't cross them over their palms , and they have rudimentary tails , or had until they were educated off them . They wore all the hair off their backs by leaning against trees . Marvellous things ! All they want is a little money . `` `` It seems to be a praiseworthy object , '' the merchant said gravely . `` I knew that you would think so ! '' cried the little philanthropist enthusiastically . `` Of course , bartering as you do with aboriginal races , their development and evolution is a matter of the deepest importance to you . If a man came down to barter with you who had a rudimentary tail and could n't bend his thumb -- -well , it would n't be pleasant , you know . Our idea is to elevate them in the scale of humanity and to refine their tastes . Hewett , of the Royal Society , went to report on the matter a year or so back , and some rather painful incident occurred . I believe Hewett met with some mishap -- -in fact , they go the length of saying that he was eaten . So you see we 've had our martyrs , my dear friend , and the least that we can do who stay at home at ease is to support a good cause to the best of our ability . `` `` Whose names have you got ? '' asked the merchant . `` Let 's see , '' Jefferson Edwards said , unfolding his list . `` Spriggs , ten ; Morton , ten ; Wigglesworth , five ; Hawkins , ten ; Indermann , fifteen ; Jones , five ; and a good many smaller amounts . `` `` What is the highest as yet ? `` `` Indermann , the tobacco importer , has given fifteen . `` `` It is a good cause , '' Mr. Girdlestone said , dipping his pen into the ink-bottle . `` 'He that giveth ' -- -you know what the good old Book says . Of course a list of the donations will be printed and circulated ? `` `` Most certainly . `` `` Here is my cheque for twenty-five pounds . I am proud to have had this opportunity of contributing towards the regeneration of those poor souls whom Providence has placed in a lower sphere than myself . `` `` Girdlestone , '' said the member of Parliament with emotion , as he pocketed the cheque , `` you are a good man . I shall not forget this , my friend ; I shall never forget it . `` `` Wealth has its duties , and charity is among them , '' Girdlestone answered with unction , shaking the philanthropist 's extended hand . `` Good-bye , my dear sir . Pray let me know if our efforts are attended with any success . Should more money be needed , you know one who may be relied on . `` There was a sardonic smile upon the hard face of the senior partner as he closed the door behind his visitor . `` It 's a legitimate investment , '' he muttered to himself as he resumed his seat . `` What with his Parliamentary interest and his financial power , it 's a very legitimate investment . It looks well on the list , too , and inspires confidence . I think the money is well spent . `` Ezra had bowed politely as the great man passed through the office , andGilray , the wizened senior clerk , opened the outer door . JeffersonEdwards turned as he passed him and clapped him on the shoulder . `` Lucky fellow , '' he said in his jerky way . `` Good employer -- -model to follow -- -great man . Watch him , mark him , imitate him -- -that 's the way to get on . Ca n't go wrong , '' and he trotted down the street in search of fresh contributions towards his latest fad.The shambling little clerk was still standing at the door watching the retreating figure of the millionaire , and mentally splicing together his fragmentary remarks into a symmetrical piece of advice which might be carried home and digested at leisure , when his attention was attracted to a pale-faced woman , with a child in her arms , who was hanging about the entrance . She looked up at the clerk in a wistful way , as if anxious to address him and yet afraid to do so . Then noting , perhaps , some gleam of kindness in his yellow wrinkled face , she came across to him . `` D 'ye think I could see Muster Girdlestone , sir , '' she asked , with a curtsey ; `` or , maybe , you 're Mr. Girdlestone yourself ? '' The woman was wretchedly dressed , and her eyelids were swollen and red as from long crying. '' Mr . Girdlestone is in his room , '' said the head clerk kindly . `` I have no doubt that he will see you if you will wait for a moment . '' Had he been speaking to the grandest of the be-silked and be-feathered dames who occasionally frequented the office ; he could not have spoken with greater courtesy . Verily in these days the spirit of true chivalry has filtered down from the surface and has found a lodgment in strange places.The merchant looked with a surprised and suspicious eye at his visitor when she was ushered in . `` Take a seat , my good woman , '' he said . `` What can I do for you ? `` `` Please , Mr. Girdlestone , I 'm Mrs. Hudson , '' she answered , seating herself in a timid way upon the extreme edge of a chair . She was weary and footsore , for she had carried the baby up from Stepney that morning . `` Hudson -- -Hudson -- -ca n't remember the name , '' said Girdlestone , shaking his head reflectively . `` Jim Hudson as was , sir , he was my husband , the bo'sun for many a year o ' your ship theBlack Eagle . He went out to try and earn a bit for me and the child , sir , but he 's dead o ' fever , poor dear , and lying in Bonny river , wi ' a cannon ball at his feet , as the carpenter himself told me who sewed him up , and I wish I was dead and with him , so I do . '' She began sobbing in her shawl and moaning , while the child , suddenly awakened by the sound , rubbed its eyes with its wrinkled mottled hands , and then proceeded to take stock of Mr. Girdlestone and his office with the critical philosophy of infancy . `` Calm yourself , my good woman , calm yourself , '' said the senior partner . He perceived that the evil prophesied by his son had come upon him , and he made a mental note of this fresh instance of Ezra 's powers of foresight . `` It was hard , so it was , '' said Mrs. Hudson , drying her eyes , but still giving vent to an occasional tempestuous sob . `` I heard as theBlack Eaglewas comin ' up the river , so I spent all I had in my pocket in makin ' Jim a nice little supper -- -ham an ' eggs , which was always his favourite , an ' a pint o ' bitter , an ' a quartern o ' whiskey that he could take hot after , bein ' naturally o ' a cold turn , and him comin ' from a warm country , too . Then out I goes , and down the river , until I sees theBlack Eaglea-comin ' up wi ' a tug in front of her . Well I knowed the two streaks o ' white paint , let alone the screechin ' o ' the parrots which I could hear from the bank . I could see the heads o ' some of the men peepin ' over the side , so I waves my handkercher , and one o ' them he waves back . 'Trust Jim for knowin ' his little wife , ' says I , proud like to myself , and I runs round to where I knew as they 'd dock her . What with me being that excited that I could n't rightly see where I was going , and what with the crowd , for the men was comin ' from work , I did n't get there till the ship was alongside . Then I jumps aboard , and the first man I seed was Sandy McPherson , who I knowed when we lived in Binnacle Lane . 'Where 's Jim ? ' I cried , running forward , eager like , to the forecastle , but he caught me by the arm as I passed him . 'Steady , lass , steady ! ' Then I looked up at him , and his face was very grave , and my knees got kind o ' weak . 'Where 's Jim ? ' says I . 'Do n't ask , ' says he . 'Where is he , Sandy ? ' I screeches ; and then , 'Do n't say the word , Sandy , do n't you say it . ' But , Lor ' bless ye , sir , it did n't much matter what he said nor what he did n't , for I knowed all , an ' down I flops on the deck in a dead faint . The mate , he took me home in a cab , and when I come to there was the supper lying , sir , and the beer , and the things a-shinin ' , and all so cosy , an ' the child askin ' where her father was , for I told her he 'd bring her some things from Africa . Then , to think of him a-lyin ' dead in Bonny river , why , sir , it nigh broke my heart . `` `` A sore affliction , '' the merchant said , shaking his grizzled head . `` A sad visitation . But these things are sent to try us , Mrs. Hudson . They are warnings to us not to fix our thoughts too much upon the dross of this world , but to have higher aims and more durable aspirations . We are poor short-sighted creatures , the best of us ,
