I go that I may learn to be a gentle and a hardy knight ? `` `` By my troth ! '' said Chandos with a smile , `` it is very fitting that we should be companions , Nigel , for since you have tied up one of your eyes , and I have had the mischance to lose one of mine , we have but a pair between us . Ah , Sir Oliver ! you were on the blind side of me and I saw you not . A wise woman hath made prophecy that this blind side will one day be the death of me . We shall go in to the prince anon ; but in truth he hath much upon his hands , for what with Pedro , and the King of Majorca , and the King of Navarre , who is no two days of the same mind , and the Gascon barons who are all chaffering for terms like so many hucksters , he hath an uneasy part to play . But how left you the Lady Loring ? `` `` She was well , my fair lord , and sent her service and greetings to you . `` `` I am ever her knight and slave . And your journey , I trust that it was pleasant ? `` `` As heart could wish . We had sight of two rover galleys , and even came to have some slight bickering with them . `` `` Ever in luck 's way , Nigel ! '' quoth Sir John . `` We must hear the tale anon . But I deem it best that ye should leave your squires and come with me , for , howsoe'er pressed the prince may be , I am very sure that he would be loth to keep two old comrades-in-arms upon the further side of the door . Follow close behind me , and I will forestall old Sir William , though I can scarce promise to roll forth your style and rank as is his wont . '' So saying , he led the way to the inner chamber , the two companions treading close at his heels , and nodding to right and left as they caught sight of familiar faces among the crowd.The prince 's reception-room , although of no great size , was fitted up with all the state and luxury which the fame and power of its owner demanded . A high dais at the further end was roofed in by a broad canopy of scarlet velvet spangled with silver fleurs-de-lis , and supported at either corner by silver rods . This was approached by four steps carpeted with the same material , while all round were scattered rich cushions , oriental mats and costly rugs of fur . The choicest tapestries which the looms of Arras could furnish draped the walls , whereon the battles of Judas Maccabaeus were set forth , with the Jewish warriors in plate of proof , with crest and lance and banderole , as the naive artists of the day were wont to depict them . A few rich settles and bancals , choicely carved and decorated with glazed leather hangings of the sort termedor basane , completed the furniture of the apartment , save that at one side of the dais there stood a lofty perch , upon which a cast of three solemn Prussian gerfalcons sat , hooded and jesseled , as silent and motionless as the royal fowler who stood beside them.In the centre of the dais were two very high chairs with dorserets , which arched forwards over the heads of the occupants , the whole covered with light-blue silk thickly powdered with golden stars . On that to the right sat a very tall and well formed man with red hair , a livid face , and a cold blue eye , which had in it something peculiarly sinister and menacing . He lounged back in a careless position , and yawned repeatedly as though heartily weary of the proceedings , stooping from time to time to fondle a shaggy Spanish greyhound which lay stretched at his feet . On the other throne there was perched bolt upright , with prim demeanor , as though he felt himself to be upon his good behavior , a little , round , pippin faced person , who smiled and bobbed to every one whose eye he chanced to meet . Between and a little in front of them on a humble charette or stool , sat a slim , dark young man , whose quiet attire and modest manner would scarce proclaim him to be the most noted prince in Europe . A jupon of dark blue cloth , tagged with buckles and pendants of gold , seemed but a sombre and plain attire amidst the wealth of silk and ermine and gilt tissue of fustian with which he was surrounded . He sat with his two hands clasped round his knee , his head slightly bent , and an expression of impatience and of trouble upon his clear , well-chiselled features . Behind the thrones there stood two men in purple gowns , with ascetic , clean-shaven faces , and half a dozen other high dignitaries and office-holders of Aquitaine . Below on either side of the steps were forty or fifty barons , knights , and courtiers , ranged in a triple row to the right and the left , with a clear passage in the centre . `` There sits the prince , '' whispered Sir John Chandos , as they entered . `` He on the right is Pedro , whom we are about to put upon the Spanish throne . The other is Don James , whom we purpose with the aid of God to help to his throne in Majorca . Now follow me , and take it not to heart if he be a little short in his speech , for indeed his mind is full of many very weighty concerns . `` The prince , however , had already observed their entrance , and , springing to his feet , he had advanced with a winning smile and the light of welcome in his eyes . `` We do not need your good offices as herald here , Sir John , '' said he in a low but clear voice ; `` these valiant knights are very well known to me . Welcome to Aquitaine , Sir Nigel Loring and Sir Oliver Buttesthorn . Nay , keep your knee for my sweet father at Windsor . I would have your hands , my friends . We are like to give you some work to do ere you see the downs of Hampshire once more . Know you aught of Spain , Sir Oliver ? `` `` Nought , my sire , save that I have heard men say that there is a dish named an olla which is prepared there , though I have never been clear in my mind as to whether it was but a ragout such as is to be found in the south , or whether there is some seasoning such as fennel or garlic which is peculiar to Spain . `` `` Your doubts , Sir Oliver , shall soon be resolved , '' answered the prince , laughing heartily , as did many of the barons who surrounded them . `` His majesty here will doubtless order that you have this dish hotly seasoned when we are all safely in Castile . `` `` I will have a hotly seasoned dish for some folk I know of , '' answered Don Pedro with a cold smile . `` But my friend Sir Oliver can fight right hardily without either bite or sup , '' remarked the prince . `` Did I not see him at Poictiers , when for two days we had not more than a crust of bread and a cup of foul water , yet carrying himself most valiantly . With my own eyes I saw him in the rout sweep the head from a knight of Picardy with one blow of his sword . `` `` The rogue got between me and the nearest French victual wain , '' muttered Sir Oliver , amid a fresh titter from those who were near enough to catch his words . `` How many have you in your train ? '' asked the prince , assuming a graver mien . `` I have forty men-at-arms , sire , '' said Sir Oliver . `` And I have one hundred archers and a score of lancers , but there are two hundred men who wait for me on this side of the water upon the borders of Navarre . `` `` And who are they , Sir Nigel ? `` `` They are a free company , sire , and they are called the White Company . `` To the astonishment of the knight , his words provoked a burst of merriment from the barons round , in which the two kings and the prince were fain to join . Sir Nigel blinked mildly from one to the other , until at last perceiving a stout black-bearded knight at his elbow , whose laugh rang somewhat louder than the others , he touched him lightly upon the sleeve . `` Perchance , my fair sir , '' he whispered , `` there is some small vow of which I may relieve you . Might we not have some honorable debate upon the matter . Your gentle courtesy may perhaps grant me an exchange of thrusts . `` `` Nay , nay , Sir Nigel , '' cried the prince , `` fasten not the offence upon Sir Robert Briquet , for we are one and all bogged in the same mire . Truth to say , our ears have just been vexed by the doings of the same company , and I have even now made vow to hang the man who held the rank of captain over it . I little thought to find him among the bravest of my own chosen chieftains . But the vow is now nought , for , as you have never seen your company , it would be a fool 's act to blame you for their doings . `` `` My liege , '' said Sir Nigel , `` it is a very small matter that I should be hanged , albeit the manner of death is somewhat more ignoble than I had hoped for . On the other hand , it would be a very grievous thing that you , the Prince of England and the flower of knighthood , should make a vow , whether in ignorance or no , and fail to bring it to fulfilment . `` `` Vex not your mind on that , '' the prince answered , smiling . `` We have had a citizen from Montauban here this very day , who told us such a tale of sack and murder and pillage that it moved our blood ; but our wrath was turned upon the man who was in authority over them . `` `` My dear and honored master , '' cried Nigel , in great anxiety , `` I fear me much that in your gentleness of heart you are straining this vow which you have taken . If there be so much as a shadow of a doubt as to the form of it , it were a thousand times best -- -- -- '' '' Peace ! peace ! '' cried the prince impatiently . `` I am very well able to look to my own vows and their performance . We hope to see you
