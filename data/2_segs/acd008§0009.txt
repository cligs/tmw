Mr . Raffles Haw has done this out of kindness to me , '' she said , sweeping towards the door . `` I look upon it as a great attention on his part . I shall certainly go out and look at it . `` `` If you please , sir , '' said the carman , reappearing at the door , `` it 's all as we can do to 'old in the 'osses . `` `` Let us all go out together then , '' suggested Robert.They went as far as the garden fence and stared over , while the whole village , from the school-children to the old grey-haired men from the almshouses , gathered round in mute astonishment . The tiger , a long , lithe , venomous-looking creature , with two blazing green eyes , paced stealthily round the little cage , lashing its sides with its tail , and rubbing its muzzle against the bars . `` What were your orders ? '' asked Robert of the carman . `` It came through by special express from Liverpool , sir , and the train is drawn up at the Tamfield siding all ready to take it back . If it 'ad been royalty the railway folk could n't ha ' shown it more respec ' . We are to take it back when you 're done with it . It 's been a cruel job , sir , for our arms is pulled clean out of the sockets a-'olding in of the 'osses . `` `` What a dear , sweet creature it is , '' cried Laura . `` How sleek and how graceful ! I can not understand how people could be afraid of anything so beautiful . `` `` If you please , marm , '' said the carman , touching his skin cap , `` he out with his paw between the bars as we stood in the station yard , and if I 'ad n't pulled my mate Bill back it would ha ' been a case of kingdom come . It was a proper near squeak , I can tell ye . `` `` I never saw anything more lovely , '' continued Laura , loftily overlooking the remarks of the driver . `` It has been a very great pleasure to me to see it , and I hope that you will tell Mr. Haw so if you see him , Robert . `` `` The horses are very restive , '' said her brother . `` Perhaps , Laura , if you have seen enough , it would be as well to let them go . `` She bowed in the regal fashion which she had so suddenly adopted . Robert shouted the order , the driver sprang up , his comrades let the horses go , and away rattled the waggon and the trolly with half the Tamfielders streaming vainly behind it . `` Is it not wonderful what money can do ? '' Laura remarked , as they knocked the snow from their shoes within the porch . `` There seems to be no wish which Mr. Haw could not at once gratify . `` `` No wish of yours , you mean , '' broke in her father . `` It 's different when he is dealing with a wrinkled old man who has spent himself in working for his children . A plainer case of love at first sight I never saw . `` `` How can you be so coarse , papa ? '' cried Laura , but her eyes flashed , and her teeth gleamed , as though the remark had not altogether displeased her . `` For heaven 's sake , be careful , Laura ! '' cried Robert . `` It had not struck me before , but really it does look rather like it . You know how you stand . Raffles Haw is not a man to play with . `` `` You dear old boy ! '' said Laura , laying her hand upon his shoulder , `` what do you know of such things ? All you have to do is to go on with your painting , and to remember the promise you made the other night . `` `` What promise was that , then ? '' cried old McIntyre suspiciously . `` Never you mind , papa . But if you forget it , Robert , I shall never forgive you as long as I live . `` It can easily be believed that as the weeks passed the name and fame of the mysterious owner of the New Hall resounded over the quiet countryside until the rumour of him had spread to the remotest corners of Warwickshire and Staffordshire . In Birmingham on the one side , and in Coventry and Leamington on the other , there was gossip as to his untold riches , his extraordinary whims , and the remarkable life which he led . His name was bandied from mouth to mouth , and a thousand efforts were made to find out who and what he was . In spite of all their pains , however , the newsmongers were unable to discover the slightest trace of his antecedents , or to form even a guess as to the secret of his riches.It was no wonder that conjecture was rife upon the subject , for hardly a day passed without furnishing some new instance of the boundlessness of his power and of the goodness of his heart . Through the vicar , Robert , and others , he had learned much of the inner life of the parish , and many were the times when the struggling man , harassed and driven to the wall , found thrust into his hand some morning a brief note with an enclosure which rolled all the sorrow back from his life . One day a thick double-breasted pea-jacket and a pair of good sturdy boots were served out to every old man in the almshouse . On another , Miss Swire , the decayed gentlewoman who eked out her small annuity by needlework , had a brand new first-class sewing-machine handed in to her to take the place of the old worn-out treadle which tried her rheumatic joints . The pale-faced schoolmaster , who had spent years with hardly a break in struggling with the juvenile obtuseness of Tamfield , received through the post a circular ticket for a two months ' tour through Southern Europe , with hotel coupons and all complete . John Hackett , the farmer , after five long years of bad seasons , borne with a brave heart , had at last been overthrown by the sixth , and had the bailiffs actually in the house when the good vicar had rushed in , waving a note above his head , to tell him not only that his deficit had been made up , but that enough remained over to provide the improved machinery which would enable him to hold his own for the future . An almost superstitious feeling came upon the rustic folk as they looked at the great palace when the sun gleamed upon the huge hot-houses , or even more so , perhaps , when at night the brilliant electric lights shot their white radiance through the countless rows of windows . To them it was as if some minor Providence presided in that great place , unseen but seeing all , boundless in its power and its graciousness , ever ready to assist and to befriend . In every good deed , however , Raffles Haw still remained in the background , while the vicar and Robert had the pleasant task of conveying his benefits to the lowly and the suffering.Once only did he appear in his own person , and that was upon the famous occasion when he saved the well-known bank of Garraweg Brothers in Birmingham . The most charitable and upright of men , the two brothers , Louis and Rupert , had built up a business which extended its ramifications into every townlet of four counties . The failure of their London agents had suddenly brought a heavy loss upon them , and the circumstance leaking out had caused a sudden and most dangerous run upon their establishment . Urgent telegrams for bullion from all their forty branches poured in at the very instant when the head office was crowded with anxious clients all waving their deposit-books , and clamouring for their money . Bravely did the two brothers with their staff stand with smiling faces behind the shining counter , while swift messengers sped and telegrams flashed to draw in all the available resources of the bank . All day the stream poured through the office , and when four o'clock came , and the doors were closed for the day , the street without was still blocked by the expectant crowd , while there remained scarce a thousand pounds of bullion in the cellars . `` It is only postponed . Louis , '' said brother Rupert despairingly , when the last clerk had left the office , and when at last they could relax the fixed smile upon their haggard faces . `` Those shutters will never come down again , '' cried brother Louis , and the two suddenly burst out sobbing in each other 's arms , not for their own griefs , but for the miseries which they might bring upon those who had trusted them.But who shall ever dare to say that there is no hope , if he will but give his griefs to the world ? That very night Mrs. Spurling had received a letter from her old school friend , Mrs. Louis Garraweg , with all her fears and her hopes poured out in it , and the whole sad story of their troubles . Swift from the Vicarage went the message to the Hall , and early next morning Mr. Raffles Haw , with a great black carpet-bag in his hand , found means to draw the cashier of the local branch of the Bank of England from his breakfast , and to persuade him to open his doors at unofficial hours . By half-past nine the crowd had already begun to collect around Garraweg 's , when a stranger , pale and thin , with a bloated carpet-bag , was shown at his own very pressing request into the bank parlour . `` It is no use , sir , '' said the elder brother humbly , as they stood together encouraging each other to turn a brave face to misfortune , `` we can do no more . We have little left , and it would be unfair to the others to pay you now . We can but hope that when our assets are realised no one will be the loser save ourselves . `` `` I did not come to draw out , but to put in , '' said Raffles Haw in his demure apologetic fashion . `` I have in my bag five thousand hundred-pound Bank of England notes . If you will have the goodness to place them to my credit account I should be extremely obliged . `` `` But , good heavens , sir ! '' stammered Rupert Garraweg , `` have you not heard ? Have you not seen ? We can not allow you to do this thing blindfold ; can we Louis ? `` `` Most certainly not . We can not recommend our bank , sir , at the present moment , for there is a run upon us , and we do not know to what lengths it may go. '' '' Tut ! tut ! '' said Raffles Haw
