'll bet that that woman over the strate there is another of the right sort . `` `` Dat voman is alvays in your head , '' the German said , with a smile . `` You shall certainly dream about her to-night . I remember a voman in Germany -- - '' And so these two Bohemians rambled on into the small hours , discoursing upon their past experiences and regaling each other with many reminiscences , some of which , perhaps , are just as well omitted and allowed to sink into oblivion . When the major finally retired for the night , his last thought was of the lady at the window and of the means by which he might contrive to learn something of her.These proved to be more easy than he anticipated , for next morning , on cross-examining the little servant girl from whom Von Baumser had derived his information , the major found out all that he desired to know . According to this authority , the lady was a widow of the name of Scully , the relict of a deceased engineer , and had been staying some little time at Morrison 's , which was the rival establishment to that in which the major and Von Baumser resided.Armed with this information , the major pondered for some time before deciding upon his course of action . He saw no possible means by which he could gain an introduction to his charming neighbour unless he had recourse to some daring strategem . `` Audace et toujours audace '' had always been the soldier 's motto . He rose from his chair , discarded his purple gown , and arrayed himself in his best attire . Never had he paid such attention to his toilet . His face was clean shaven and shining , his sparse hairs were laid out to the best advantage , his collar spotless , his frock coat oppressively respectable , and histout ensembleirreproachable . `` Be George ! '' he said to himself , as he surveyed himself in the small lodging-house glass , `` I 'd look as young as Baumser if I had some more hair on me head . Bad cess to the helmets and shakoes that wore it all off . `` When his toilet was fully completed and rounded off by the addition of a pair of light gloves and an ebony stick with a silver head , the veteran strode forth with a bold front , but with considerable trepidation at his heart ; for when is a man so seasoned as to have no misgivings when he makes the first advances to a woman who really attracts him ? Whatever the major 's inward feelings may have been , however , he successfully concealed them as he rang the bell of the rival lodging-house and inquired of the servant whether Mrs. Scully was at home . `` Yes , sir , she is , '' said the slavey , with a frightened bob , which was a tribute to the major 's martial mien and gorgeous attire . `` Would you tell her that I should like to see her , '' said the major boldly . `` I sha n't detain her a moment . Here is my card -- -Major Tobias Clutterbuck , late of the 119th Light Infantry . `` The servant disappeared with the card , and presently returned with a request that he would step up . The old soldier stumped his way upstairs with the firm footfall of one who has taken a thing in hand and means to carry it through at all hazard . As he ascended , it seemed to him that he heard the sound of feminine laughter in the distance . If so , it could hardly have come from the lady whom he was in quest of , for he was shown into a large and well-furnished room , where she sat looking demure and grave enough , as did another young lady who was crocheting on the ottoman beside her.The major made his most courtly bow , though he felt very much as the Spaniards may be supposed to have done when they saw their ships blazing behind them . `` I trust you will excuse this intrusion on my part , '' he began . `` I happened to hear that a lady of the name of Scully was stopping here . `` `` My name is Scully , sir , '' said the lady , whose dark eyes had allured the major to this feat of daring . `` Then perhaps , madam , '' the veteran said with another bow , `` you will allow me to ask you whether you are any relation to Major-gineral Scully , of the Indian Sappers ? `` `` Pray take a seat , Major -- -Major Clutterbuck , '' said Mrs. Scully , referring to his card , which she still held in her very well-formed little hand . `` Major-general Scully , did you say ? Dear me ! I know that one of my husband 's relations went into the army , but we never heard what became of him . A major-general , is he ? Whoever would have thought it ! `` `` As dashing a souldier , madam , '' said the major , warming into eloquence , `` as ever hewed a way through the ranks of the enemy , or stormed the snow-clad passes of the Himalayas. '' '' Fancy ! '' ejaculated the young lady with the crochet needle . `` Many a time , '' continued the soldier , `` he and I after some hard-fought battle have slept togither upon the blood-stained ground wrapped in the same martial cloak. '' '' Fancy ! '' cried both ladies in chorus ; and they could not have selected a more appropriate interjection . `` And when at last he died , '' the major went on with emotion , `` cut in two with a tulwar in a skirmish with hill tribes , he turned to me -- - '' '' After being cut in two ? '' interrupted the younger lady . `` He turned to me , '' said the major inflexibly , `` and putting his hand in mine , he said , with his last breath , 'Toby ' -- -that was what he always called me -- -'Toby , ' he said , 'I have a -- - ' Your husband was his brother , I think you said , ma'am ? `` `` No , it was Mr. Scully 's uncle who went into the army . `` `` Ah , quite so . 'I have a nephew in England , ' he said , 'who is very dear to me . He is married to a charming woman . Search out the young couple , Toby . Guard over them . Protict them ! ' Those were his last words , madam . Next moment his sowl had fled . When I heard your name casually mintioned I could not feel satisfied in me mind until I had come across and ascertained if you were the lady in question . `` Now , this narrative not only surprised the widow , which was not unnatural , seeing that it was entirely an invention of the old soldier 's , but it appealed to her weakest point . The father of the deceased Scully had been of plebeian origin , so that the discovery in the family of a real major-general -- -albeit he was dead -- -was a famous windfall , for the widow had social ambitions which hitherto she had never been able to gratify . Hence she smiled sweetly at the veteran in a way which stimulated him to further flights of mendacity . `` Sure he and I were like brothers , '' he said . `` He was a man that any one might well be proud to know . Commander-in-chief said to me once , 'Clutterbuck , ' says he , 'I do n't know what we 'd do if we had a European war . I 've no one I can rely on , ' says he . 'There 's Scully , ' says I . 'Right , ' says he , 'Scully would be our man . ' He was terribly cut up when this occurred . 'Here 's a blow to the British army ! ' he remarked , as he looked down at him where he lay with a bullet through his head -- -he did , madam , be Jove ! `` `` But , major , I understood you to say that he was cut in two ? `` `` So he was . Cut in two , and shot and mortally wounded in a dozen places besides . Ah , if he could have foreseen that I should have met you he would have died happy . `` `` It 's strange he never let us know of his existence when he was alive , '' the widow remarked . `` Pride , madam , pride ! 'Until I reach the top of the tree , Toby , ' he used to say , 'I shall niver reveal myself to me brother . ' '' '' Nephew , '' interpolated the widow . `` Quite so -- - ' I shall niver reveal myself to me nephew . ' He said those very words to me only a few minutes before the fatal shell struck him . `` `` A shell , major ? You mean a bullet . `` `` A shell , madam , a shell , '' said the major with decision . `` Dear me ! '' exclaimed Mrs. Scully , with a somewhat bewildered expression . `` How very sad it all is . We must thank you very much , Major Bottletop -- - '' '' Clutterbuck , '' said the Major . `` I beg pardon , Major Clutterbuck . It was very kind of you to call upon us in this friendly way and to give us these details . Of course , when a relative dies , even though you do n't know much about him , still it is interesting to have a clear account of how it all happened . Just fancy , Clara , '' continued the widow , drawing her handkerchief from her reticule and mopping one of her eyes with it . `` Just fancy the poor fellow being cut in two with a bullet far away in India and him just speaking about Jack and me a few minutes before . I am sure we must thank Major Bottlenose -- - '' '' Clutterbuck , madam , '' cried the major with some indignation . `` I really beg pardon . We must thank him , Clara , for having told us about it and for having called . `` `` Do not thank me , me dear Mrs. Scully , '' said the major , clearing his throat and waving his stubby hand deprecatingly . `` I have already had me reward in having the pleasure and honour of making your acquaintance and of coming nearer to those charums which I had alriddy admired from a distance . `` `` Oh , auntie , listen to that ! '' cried Clara , and both ladies giggled . `` Not forgetting yours , Miss-Miss -- - '' '' Miss Timms , '' said Mrs. Scully . `` My brother 's daughter . `` `` Not forgetting your charums , Miss Timms , '' continued the major , with a bow and a flourish . `` To a lonely man like meself , the very sight of
