stabbing into the air with their forefingers . `` Rocks beneath our very bows ! '' Through the belly of a great black wave , not one hundred paces to the front of them , there thrust forth a huge jagged mass of brown stone , which spouted spray as though it were some crouching monster , while a dull menacing boom and roar filled the air. '' Yare ! yare ! '' screamed Goodwin Hawtayne , flinging himself upon the long pole which served as a tiller . `` Cut the halliard ! Haul her over ! Lay her two courses to the wind ! `` Over swung the great boom , and the cog trembled and quivered within five spear-lengths of the breakers . `` She can scarce draw clear , '' cried Hawtayne , with his eyes from the sail to the seething line of foam . `` May the holy Julian stand by us and the thrice-sainted Christopher ! `` `` If there be such peril , Sir Oliver , '' quoth Sir Nigel , `` it would be very knightly and fitting that we should show our pennons . I pray you , Edricson , that you will command my guidon-bearer to put forward my banner . `` `` And sound the trumpets ! '' cried Sir Oliver . `` In manus tuas , Domine ! I am in the keeping of James of Compostella , to whose shrine I shall make pilgrimage , and in whose honor I vow that I will eat a carp each year upon his feast-day . Mon Dieu , but the waves roar ! How is it with us now , master-shipman ? `` `` We draw ! We draw ! '' cried Hawtayne , with his eyes still fixed upon the foam which hissed under the very bulge of the side . `` Ah , Holy Mother , be with us now ! `` As he spoke the cog rasped along the edge of the reef , and a long white curling sheet of wood was planed off from her side from waist to poop by a jutting horn of the rock . At the same instant she lay suddenly over , the sail drew full , and she plunged seawards amid the shoutings of the seamen and the archers . `` The Virgin be praised ! '' cried the shipman , wiping his brow . `` For this shall bell swing and candle burn when I see Southampton Water once more . Cheerily , my hearts ! Pull yarely on the bowline ! `` `` By my soul ! I would rather have a dry death , '' quoth Sir Oliver . `` Though , Mort Dieu ! I have eaten so many fish that it were but justice that the fish should eat me . Now I must back to the cabin , for I have matters there which crave my attention . `` `` Nay , Sir Oliver , you had best bide with us , and still show your ensign , '' Sir Nigel answered ; `` for , if I understand the matter aright , we have but turned from one danger to the other . `` `` Good Master Hawtayne , '' cried the boatswain , rushing aft , `` the water comes in upon us apace . The waves have driven in the sail wherewith we strove to stop the hole . '' As he spoke the seamen came swarming on to the poop and the forecastle to avoid the torrent which poured through the huge leak into the waist . High above the roar of the wind and the clash of the sea rose the shrill half-human cries of the horses , as they found the water rising rapidly around them . `` Stop it from without ! '' cried Hawtayne , seizing the end of the wet sail with which the gap had been plugged . `` Speedily , my hearts , or we are gone ! '' Swiftly they rove ropes to the corners , and then , rushing forward to the bows , they lowered them under the keel , and drew them tight in such a way that the sail should cover the outer face of the gap . The force of the rush of water was checked by this obstacle , but it still squirted plentifully from every side of it . At the sides the horses were above the belly , and in the centre a man from the poop could scarce touch the deck with a seven-foot spear . The cog lay lower in the water and the waves splashed freely over the weather bulwark . `` I fear that we can scarce bide upon this tack , '' cried Hawtayne ; `` and yet the other will drive us on the rocks . `` `` Might we not haul down sail and wait for better times ? '' suggested Sir Nigel . `` Nay , we should drift upon the rocks . Thirty years have I been on the sea , and never yet in greater straits . Yet we are in the hands of the Saints . `` `` Of whom , '' cried Sir Oliver , `` I look more particularly to St. James of Compostella , who hath already befriended us this day , and on whose feast I hereby vow that I shall eat a second carp , if he will but interpose a second time . `` The wrack had thickened to seaward , and the coast was but a blurred line . Two vague shadows in the offing showed where the galeasses rolled and tossed upon the great Atlantic rollers . Hawtayne looked wistfully in their direction . `` If they would but lie closer we might find safety , even should the cog founder . You will bear me out with good Master Witherton of Southampton that I have done all that a shipman might . It would be well that you should doff camail and greaves , Sir Nigel , for , by the black rood ! it is like enough that we shall have to swim for it . `` `` Nay , '' said the little knight , `` it would be scarce fitting that a cavalier should throw off his harness for the fear of every puff of wind and puddle of water . I would rather that my Company should gather round me here on the poop , where we might abide together whatever God may be pleased to send . But , certes , Master Hawtayne , for all that my sight is none of the best , it is not the first time that I have seen that headland upon the left . `` The seaman shaded his eyes with his hand , and gazed earnestly through the haze and spray . Suddenly he threw up his arms and shouted aloud in his joy . `` 'T is the point of La Tremblade ! '' he cried . `` I had not thought that we were as far as Oleron . The Gironde lies before us , and once over the bar , and under shelter of the Tour de Cordouan , all will be well with us . Veer again , my hearts , and bring her to try with the main course ! `` The sail swung round once more , and the cog , battered and torn and well-nigh water-logged , staggered in for this haven of refuge . A bluff cape to the north and a long spit to the south marked the mouth of the noble river , with a low-lying island of silted sand in the centre , all shrouded and curtained by the spume of the breakers . A line of broken water traced the dangerous bar , which in clear day and balmy weather has cracked the back of many a tall ship . `` There is a channel , '' said Hawtayne , `` which was shown to me by the Prince 's own pilot . Mark yonder tree upon the bank , and see the tower which rises behind it . If these two be held in a line , even as we hold them now , it may be done , though our ship draws two good ells more than when she put forth . `` `` God speed you , Master Hawtayne ! '' cried Sir Oliver . `` Twice have we come scathless out of peril , and now for the third time I commend me to the blessed James of Compostella , to whom I vow -- -- -- '' '' Nay , nay , old friend , '' whispered Sir Nigel . `` You are like to bring a judgment upon us with these vows , which no living man could accomplish . Have I not already heard you vow to eat two carp in one day , and now you would venture upon a third ? `` `` I pray you that you will order the Company to lie down , '' cried Hawtayne , who had taken the tiller and was gazing ahead with a fixed eye . `` In three minutes we shall either be lost or in safety . `` Archers and seamen lay flat upon the deck , waiting in stolid silence for whatever fate might come . Hawtayne bent his weight upon the tiller , and crouched to see under the bellying sail . Sir Oliver and Sir Nigel stood erect with hands crossed in front of the poop . Down swooped the great cog into the narrow channel which was the portal to safety . On either bow roared the shallow bar . Right ahead one small lane of black swirling water marked the pilot 's course . But true was the eye and firm the hand which guided . A dull scraping came from beneath , the vessel quivered and shook , at the waist , at the quarter , and behind sounded that grim roaring of the waters , and with a plunge the yellow cog was over the bar and speeding swiftly up the broad and tranquil estuary of the Gironde.It was on the morning of Friday , the eight-and-twentieth day of November , two days before the feast of St. Andrew , that the cog and her two prisoners , after a weary tacking up the Gironde and the Garonne , dropped anchor at last in front of the noble city of Bordeaux . With wonder and admiration , Alleyne , leaning over the bulwarks , gazed at the forest of masts , the swarm of boats darting hither and thither on the bosom of the broad curving stream , and the gray crescent-shaped city which stretched with many a tower and minaret along the western shore . Never had he in his quiet life seen so great a town , nor was there in the whole of England , save London alone , one which might match it in size or in wealth . Here came the merchandise of all the fair countries which are watered by the Garonne and the Dordogne -- -the cloths of the south , the skins of Guienne , the wines of the Medoc -- -to be borne away to Hull , Exeter , Dartmouth , Bristol or Chester , in exchange for the wools and woolfels of England . Here too dwelt those famous smelters and welders who had made the Bordeaux steel the most trusty upon earth , and could give a temper to lance or to sword which might mean dear life to its owner . Alleyne could see the smoke of their forges reeking up in the clear morning air . The storm had died down now to a gentle breeze ,
