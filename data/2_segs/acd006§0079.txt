stretch out a hand to help one 's self . Once Captain Hamilton Miggs clawed his way along the rail to where the Girdlestones were standing . `` Look there ! '' he roared , pointing to windward.It was difficult to turn one 's face straight to the wild rush of wind and spray and hail . Shading their eyes , they peered into the storm . Right in the heart of it , and apparently not more than a couple of hundred yards from the barque , was a lurid glare of ruddy light , rising and falling with the sea , but advancing rapidly through it . There was a bright central glowing spot , with smaller lights glimmering above and beside it . The effect of the single glare of light against the inky darkness of the sea and sky would have made a study for a Turner . `` What 's that ? `` `` It 's a steamer , '' the captain shouted . It was only by great exertions that he could make himself audible above the shrieking of the wind and the dash of the waves . `` What do you think of it all ? '' Ezra asked . `` Very bad , '' Miggs answered . `` Could n't be worse ; '' and with that he clawed his way aft again , grasping every stanchion or shroud on his way , like a parroquet in a cage.The clouds above broke somewhat towards morning , but there was no sign of abatement in the tempest . Here and there through the rifts the glimmer of the stars might be seen , and once the pale moon gleamed through the storm wreath . The dawn broke cheerless and dreary , disclosing the great turmoil of endless slate-coloured waves and the solitary little barque , with her rag of canvas , like a broken-winged seabird , staggering to the south.Even the Girdlestones had noticed that , whereas towards the commencement of the storm it had been a rare occurrence for a wave to break over the ship , the decks were now continually knee-deep in water , and there was a constant splashing and crashing as the seas curled over the weather bulwark . Miggs had already observed it , and conferred gravely with his mate on the point . `` I do n't like the looks of her , Mac , '' he shouted . `` She do n't rise to them . `` `` She 's near water-logged , I 'm thinkin ' , '' the mate responded gravely.He knew the danger , and his thoughts were wandering away to a little slate-tiled cottage near Peterhead . It is true that there was not much in it save a wife , who was said to give Sandy the rough side of her tongue , and occasionally something rougher still . Affection is a capricious emotion , however , and will cling to the most unlikely objects ; so the big Scotchman 's eyes were damp with something else beside the sea spray as he realized that he might never look upon cottage or occupant again . `` No wonder , '' said Miggs , `` when she 's takin ' in water above and below too . The men are weary wi ' pumpin ' , and it still gains . `` `` I doot it 's our last v'yage thgither , '' the mate remarked , his Scottish accent waxing broader under the influence of emotion . `` What d 'ye say to heavin ' her to ? `` `` I 'd let her run on . She would na rise tae the waves , I 'm fearin ' . We canna be vera fa ' frae the Spanish coast , accordin ' to my surmisation . That wud gie us a chance o ' savin ' oorsels , though I 'm a feared na boat would live in siccan a sea . `` `` You 're right . We have a better chance so than if we let her ride . She 'd founder as sure as eggs are eggs . Damn it , Mac , I could almost be glad this has happened now we 've got them two aboard . We 'll teach 'em what coffin ships is like in a gale o ' wind . '' The rough seaman laughed hoarsely as he spoke.The carpenter came aft at this moment , balancing himself as best he could , for the deck was only a few degrees off the perpendicular . `` The leak is gaining fast , '' he said . `` The hands are clean done up.There 's land on the port bow . `` The mate and the captain peered out through the dense wrack and haze . A great dark cliff loomed out upon the left , jagged , inhospitable , and menacing . `` We 'd best run towards it , '' the mate said . `` We 've na chance o ' saving the ship , but we might run her ashore . `` `` The ship will go down before you reach it , '' the carpenter remarked gloomily . `` Keep your heart up ! '' Miggs shouted , and then crawled along to the Girdlestones . `` There is no hope for the ship but we may save ourselves , '' he said . `` You 'll have to take your turn at the pumps . `` They followed him forward without a word . The crew , listless and weary , were grouped about the pumps . The feeble clanking sounded like the ticking of a watch amid the horrible uproar which filled the air . `` Buckle to again , boys ! '' cried Miggs . `` These two will help you and the carpenter and mate . `` Ezra and his father , the old man 's grizzled locks flying wildly from his head , seized the rope and worked with the crew , hardly able to retain their foothold upon the slippery sloping decks . Miggs went down into the cabin . His behaviour during the gale had been most exemplary , but he recognized now that there was nothing more to be done , and , having thrown off his public responsibilities , he renewed his private peculiarities . He filled out nearly a tumblerful of raw rum and took it off at a gulp . Then he began to sing and made his way on deck in a very hilarious and reckless mood.The vessel was still flying towards the rugged line of cliffs , which were now visible along the whole horizon , the great projection on the left being their culminating point . She was obviously sinking lower in the water , and she plunged in a heavy , sulky manner through the waves , instead of rising to them as she did before . The water was steadily gaining in her interior , and it was clear that she would not float long . The straining of the gale had increased the long-neglected rifts between her timbers , and no amount of pumping could save her . On the other hand , the sky had broken above them , and the wind was by no means so violent as before . The sun broke through between two great hurrying clouds , and turned all the waves to the brightest emerald green , with sparkling snow-white crests of foam . This sudden change and the brightness of the scene made their fate seem all the harder to the seamen aboard the sinking vessel . `` The gale is clearin ' , '' remarked McPherson . `` If we 'd had a ship that wasna rotten to the hairt , like her owners , we 'd ha pu'ed through . `` `` Right you are , old Sandy ! But we 're all goin ' together , captain and owners and the whole bilin ' , '' yelled Miggs recklessly.The mate looked at him half in surprise and half in contempt . `` You 've been at the bottle , '' he said . `` Eh mun , mun , if we are a'drooned , as seems likely , it 's an awfu ' thing to appear before yourMaker wi ' your meeserable soul a ' steeped in drink . `` `` You go down and have a drink yourself , '' Miggs cried huskily . `` Na , na . If I am to dee , I 'll dee sober . `` `` You 'll die a fool , '' the skipper shouted wrathfully . `` Well , old preacher , you 've brought us into a nice hole with your damned insurance cheating , cheese-paring business . What d 'ye think of it now , when the ship 's settlin ' down under our feet , eh ? Would you repair her if you had her back in the Albert Dock , eh ? `` This speech was addressed to the old merchant , who had ceased pumping , and was leaning against the cuddy and looking up hopelessly at the long line of brown cliffs which were now only half a mile away . They could hear the roar of the surf , and saw the white breakers where the Atlantic stormed in all its fury against nature 's break-water . `` He 's not fit to command , '' said Ezra to the mate . `` What would you advise ? `` `` We 'll bring her round and lower the boats on the lee side . They may live or no , but it 's the only chance for us . Them twa boats will hold us a ' easy . `` The ship was settling down in the water so fast that it was no difficult matter to let the boats down . They only hung a few feet above the surface . The majority of the crew got safely into the long boat , and the Girdlestones , with Miggs and four seamen , occupied the gig . It was no easy thing to prevent the boats from being stove , as the waves alternately drove them from the ship 's side or brought the two together with a force which seemed irresistible . By skilful management , however , they both succeeded in casting off and getting clear without accident.It was only when they emerged from under the shelter of the vessel that they felt the full power of the sea . If it had appeared stupendous when they trod the deck of the barque , how much more so now , when , by leaning the arm over the side , they could touch the surface . The great glassy green billows hurled them up and down , and tossed them and buffeted them as though the two boats were their playthings , and they were trying what antics they could perform with them without destroying them . Girdlestone sat very grim and pale , with Ezra at his side . The young fellow 's expression was that of a daring man who realizes his danger , but is determined to throw no chance of safety away . His mouth was set firm and hard , and his dark eyebrows were drawn down over his keen eyes , which glanced swiftly to right and left , like a rat in a trap . Miggs held the tiller , and laughed from time to time in a drunken fashion , while the four seamen , quiet and subdued , steadied the boat as long as they could with their oars , and looked occasionally over their shoulders at the breakers behind them . The sun was shining on the rugged precipices , showing out
