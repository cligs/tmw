which he had heard so little that was good . His hostess would hear nothing of his paying either for bed or for board , while the archer and Hordle John placed a hand upon either shoulder and led him off to the board , where some smoking fish , a dish of spinach , and a jug of milk were laid out for their breakfast . `` I should not be surprised to learn , mon camarade , '' said the soldier , as he heaped a slice of fish upon Alleyne 's tranchoir of bread , `` that you could read written things , since you are so ready with your brushes and pigments . `` `` It would be shame to the good brothers of Beaulieu if I could not , '' he answered , `` seeing that I have been their clerk this ten years back . `` The bowman looked at him with great respect . `` Think of that ! '' said he . `` And you with not a hair to your face , and a skin like a girl . I can shoot three hundred and fifty paces with my little popper there , and four hundred and twenty with the great war-bow ; yet I can make nothing of this , nor read my own name if you were to set 'Sam Aylward ' up against me . In the whole Company there was only one man who could read , and he fell down a well at the taking of Ventadour , which proves that the thing is not suited to a soldier , though most needful to a clerk . `` `` I can make some show at it , '' said big John ; `` though I was scarce long enough among the monks to catch the whole trick of it . `` Here , then , is something to try upon , '' quoth the archer , pulling a square of parchment from the inside of his tunic . It was tied securely with a broad band of purple silk , and firmly sealed at either end with a large red seal . John pored long and earnestly over the inscription upon the back , with his brows bent as one who bears up against great mental strain . `` Not having read much of late , '' he said , `` I am loth to say too much about what this may be . Some might say one thing and some another , just as one bowman loves the yew , and a second will not shoot save with the ash . To me , by the length and the look of it , I should judge this to be a verse from one of the Psalms . `` The bowman shook his head . `` It is scarce likely , '' he said , `` that Sir Claude Latour should send me all the way across seas with nought more weighty than a psalm-verse . You have clean overshot the butts this time , mon camarade . Give it to the little one . I will wager my feather-bed that he makes more sense of it . `` `` Why , it is written in the French tongue , '' said Alleyne , `` and in a right clerkly hand . This is how it runs : 'A le moult puissant et moult honorable chevalier , Sir Nigel Loring de Christchurch , de son tres fidele ami Sir Claude Latour , capitaine de la Compagnie blanche , chatelain de Biscar , grand seigneur de Montchateau , vavaseur de le renomme Gaston , Comte de Foix , tenant les droits de la haute justice , de la milieu , et de la basse . ' Which signifies in our speech : 'To the very powerful and very honorable knight , Sir Nigel Loring of Christchurch , from his very faithful friend Sir Claude Latour , captain of the White Company , chatelain of Biscar , grand lord of Montchateau and vassal to the renowned Gaston , Count of Foix , who holds the rights of the high justice , the middle and the low . ' '' '' Look at that now ! '' cried the bowman in triumph . `` That is just what he would have said . `` `` I can see now that it is even so , '' said John , examining the parchment again . `` Though I scarce understand this high , middle and low . `` `` By my hilt ! you would understand it if you were Jacques Bonhomme . The low justice means that you may fleece him , and the middle that you may torture him , and the high that you may slay him . That is about the truth of it . But this is the letter which I am to take ; and since the platter is clean it is time that we trussed up and were afoot . You come with me , mon gros Jean ; and as to you , little one , where did you say that you journeyed ? `` `` To Minstead . `` `` Ah , yes . I know this forest country well , though I was born myself in the Hundred of Easebourne , in the Rape of Chichester , hard by the village of Midhurst . Yet I have not a word to say against the Hampton men , for there are no better comrades or truer archers in the whole Company than some who learned to loose the string in these very parts . We shall travel round with you to Minstead lad , seeing that it is little out of our way . `` `` I am ready , '' said Alleyne , right pleased at the thought of such company upon the road . `` So am not I. I must store my plunder at this inn , since the hostess is an honest woman . Hola ! ma cherie , I wish to leave with you my gold-work , my velvet , my silk , my feather bed , my incense-boat , my ewer , my naping linen , and all the rest of it . I take only the money in a linen bag , and the box of rose colored sugar which is a gift from my captain to the Lady Loring . Wilt guard my treasure for me ? `` `` It shall be put in the safest loft , good archer . Come when you may , you shall find it ready for you . `` `` Now , there is a true friend ! '' cried the bowman , taking her hand . `` There is a bonne amie ! English land and English women , say I , and French wine and French plunder . I shall be back anon , mon ange . I am a lonely man , my sweeting , and I must settle some day when the wars are over and done . Mayhap you and I -- -- -- Ah , mechante , mechante ! There is la petite peeping from behind the door . Now , John , the sun is over the trees ; you must be brisker than this when the bugleman blows 'Bows and Bills . ' '' '' I have been waiting this time back , '' said Hordle John gruffly . `` Then we must be off . Adieu , ma vie ! The two livres shall settle the score and buy some ribbons against the next kermesse . Do not forget Sam Aylward , for his heart shall ever be thine alone -- -and thine , ma petite ! So , marchons , and may St. Julian grant us as good quarters elsewhere ! `` The sun had risen over Ashurst and Denny woods , and was shining brightly , though the eastern wind had a sharp flavor to it , and the leaves were flickering thickly from the trees . In the High Street of Lyndhurst the wayfarers had to pick their way , for the little town was crowded with the guardsmen , grooms , and yeomen prickers who were attached to the King 's hunt . The King himself was staying at Castle Malwood , but several of his suite had been compelled to seek such quarters as they might find in the wooden or wattle-and-daub cottages of the village . Here and there a small escutcheon , peeping from a glassless window , marked the night 's lodging of knight or baron . These coats-of-arms could be read , where a scroll would be meaningless , and the bowman , like most men of his age , was well versed in the common symbols of heraldry . `` There is the Saracen 's head of Sir Bernard Brocas , '' quoth he . `` I saw him last at the ruffle at Poictiers some ten years back , when he bore himself like a man . He is the master of the King 's horse , and can sing a right jovial stave , though in that he can not come nigh to Sir John Chandos , who is first at the board or in the saddle . Three martlets on a field azure , that must be one of the Luttrells . By the crescent upon it , it should be the second son of old Sir Hugh , who had a bolt through his ankle at the intaking of Romorantin , he having rushed into the fray ere his squire had time to clasp his solleret to his greave . There too is the hackle which is the old device of the De Brays . I have served under Sir Thomas de Bray , who was as jolly as a pie , and a lusty swordsman until he got too fat for his harness . `` So the archer gossiped as the three wayfarers threaded their way among the stamping horses , the busy grooms , and the knots of pages and squires who disputed over the merits of their masters ' horses and deer-hounds . As they passed the old church , which stood upon a mound at the left-hand side of the village street the door was flung open , and a stream of worshippers wound down the sloping path , coming from the morning mass , all chattering like a cloud of jays . Alleyne bent knee and doffed hat at the sight of the open door ; but ere he had finished an ave his comrades were out of sight round the curve of the path , and he had to run to overtake them. '' What ! '' he said , `` not one word of prayer before God 's own open house ? How can ye hope for His blessing upon the day ? `` `` My friend , '' said Hordle John , `` I have prayed so much during the last two months , not only during the day , but at matins , lauds , and the like , when I could scarce keep my head upon my shoulders for nodding , that I feel that I have somewhat over-prayed myself . `` `` How can a man have too much religion ? '' cried Alleyne earnestly . `` It is the one thing that availeth . A man is but a beast as he lives from day to day , eating and drinking , breathing and sleeping . It is only when he raises himself , and concerns himself with the immortal spirit within him , that he becomes in very truth a man . Bethink ye how sad a thing it would be that the blood of the Redeemer should be spilled to
