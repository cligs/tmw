fact that her rival was a very different woman to poor meek little Maria Theresa . No ; her spirit was broken at last . She must accept defeat , and she must go.She rose from the couch , feeling that she had aged ten years in an hour . There was much to be done , and little time in which to do it . She had cast down her jewels when the king had spoken as though they would atone for the loss of his love ; but now that the love was gone there was no reason why the jewels should be lost too . If she had ceased to be the most powerful , she might still be the richest woman in France . There was her pension , of course . That would be a munificent one , for Louis was always generous . And then there was all the spoil which she had collected during these long years -- -the jewels the pearls , the gold , the vases , the pictures , the crucifixes , the watches , the trinkets -- -together they represented many millions of livres . With her own hands she packed away the more precious and portable of them , while she arranged with her brother for the safe-keeping of the others . All day she was at work in a mood of feverish energy , doing anything and everything which might distract her thoughts from her own defeat and her rival 's victory . By evening all was ready , and she had arranged that her property should be sent after her to Petit Bourg , to which castle she intended to retire.It wanted half an hour of the time fixed for her departure , when a young cavalier , whose face was strange to her , was ushered into the room.He came with a message from her brother . `` Monsieur de Vivonne regrets , madame , that the rumour of your departure has got abroad among the court . `` `` What do I care for that , monsieur ? '' she retorted , with all her old spirit . `` He says , madame , that the courtiers may assemble at the west gate to see you go ; that Madame de Neuilly will be there , and the Duchesse de Chambord , and Mademoiselle de Rohan , and -- - '' The lady shrank with horror at the thought of such an ordeal . To drive away from the palace , where she had been more than queen , under the scornful eyes and bitter gibes of so many personal enemies ! After all the humiliations of the day , that would be the crowning cup of sorrow . Her nerve was broken . She could not face it . `` Tell my brother , monsieur , that I should be much obliged if he would make fresh arrangements , by which my departure might be private . `` `` He bade me say that he had done so , madame. '' '' Ah ! at what hour then ? '' '' Now . As soon as possible . `` `` I am ready . At the west gate then ? `` `` No ; at the east . The carriage waits . `` `` And where is my brother ? `` `` We are to pick him up at the park gate . `` `` And why that ? `` `` Because he is watched ; and were he seen beside the carriage , all would be known . `` `` Very good . Then , monsieur , if you will take my cloak and this casket we may start at once . `` They made their way by a circuitous route through the less-used corridors , she hurrying on like a guilty creature , a hood drawn over her face , and her heart in a flutter at every stray footfall . But fortune stood her friend . She met no one , and soon found herself at the eastern postern gate . A couple of phlegmatic Swiss guardsmen leaned upon their muskets upon either side , and the lamp above shone upon the carriage which awaited her . The door was open , and a tall cavalier swathed in a black cloak handed her into it . He then took the seat opposite to her , slammed the door , and the caleche rattled away down the main drive.It had not surprised her that this man should join her inside the coach , for it was usual to have a guard there , and he was doubtless taking the place which her brother would afterwards occupy . That was all natural enough . But when ten minutes passed by , and he had neither moved nor spoken , she peered at him through the gloom with some curiosity . In the glance which she had of him , as he handed her in , she had seen that he was dressed like a gentleman , and there was that in his bow and wave as he did it which told her experienced senses that he was a man of courtly manners . But courtiers , as she had known them , were gallant and garrulous , and this man was so very quiet and still . Again she strained her eyes through the gloom . His hat was pulled down and his cloak was still drawn across his mouth , but from out of the shadow she seemed to get a glimpse of two eyes which peered at her even as she did at him.At last the silence impressed her with a vague uneasiness . It was time to bring it to an end . `` Surely , monsieur , we have passed the park gate where we were to pick up my brother . `` Her companion neither answered nor moved . She thought that perhaps the rumble of the heavy caleche had drowned her voice . `` I say , monsieur , '' she repeated , leaning forwards , `` that we have passed the place where we were to meet Monsieur de Vivonne . `` He took no notice . `` Monsieur , '' she cried , `` I again remark that we have passed the gates . `` There was no answer.A thrill ran through her nerves . Who or what could he be , this silent man ? Then suddenly it struck her that he might be dumb . `` Perhaps monsieur is afflicted , '' she said . `` Perhaps monsieur can not speak . If that be the cause of your silence , will you raise your hand , and I shall understand . '' He sat rigid and silent.Then a sudden mad fear came upon her , shut up in the dark with this dreadful voiceless thing . She screamed in her terror , and strove to pull down the window and open the door . But a grip of steel closed suddenly round her wrist and forced her back into her seat . And yet the man 's body had not moved , and there was no sound save the lurching and rasping of the carriage and the clatter of the flying horses . They were already out on the country roads far beyond Versailles . It was darker than before , heavy clouds had banked over the heavens , and the rumbling of thunder was heard low down on the horizon.The lady lay back panting upon the leather cushions of the carriage . She was a brave woman , and yet this sudden strange horror coming upon her at the moment when she was weakest had shaken her to the soul . She crouched in the corner , staring across with eyes which were dilated with terror at the figure on the other side . If he would but say something ! Any revelation , any menace , was better than this silence . It was so dark now that she could hardly see his vague outline , and every instant , as the storm gathered , it became still darker . The wind was blowing in little short angry puffs , and still there was that far-off rattle and rumble . Again the strain of the silence was unbearable . She must break it at any cost . `` Sir , '' said she , `` there is some mistake here . I do not know by what right you prevent me from pulling down the window and giving my directions to the coachman . `` He said nothing . `` I repeat , sir , that there is some mistake . This is the carriage of my brother , Monsieur de Vivonne , and he is not a man who will allow his sister to be treated uncourteously . `` A few heavy drops of rain splashed against one window . The clouds were lower and denser . She had quite lost sight of that motionless figure , but it was all the more terrible to her now that it was unseen . She screamed with sheer terror , but her scream availed no more than her words . `` Sir , '' she cried , clutching forward with her hands and grasping hissleeve , `` you frighten me . You terrify me . I have never harmed you.Why should you wish to hurt an unfortunate woman ? Oh , speak to me ; forGod 's sake , speak ! `` Still the patter of rain upon the window , and no other sound save her own sharp breathing . `` Perhaps you do not know who I am ! '' she continued , endeavouring to assume her usual tone of command , and talking now to an absolute and impenetrable darkness . `` You may learn when it is too late that you have chosen the wrong person for this pleasantry . I am the Marquise de Montespan , and I am not one who forgets a slight . If you know anything of the court , you must know that my word has some weight with the king . You may carry me away in this carriage , but I am not a person who can disappear without speedy inquiry , and speedy vengeance if I have been wronged . If you would -- -Oh , Jesus ! Have mercy ! `` A livid flash of lightning had burst from the heart of the cloud , and , for an instant , the whole country-side and the interior of the caleche were as light as day . The man 's face was within a hand 's breadth of her own , his mouth wide open , his eyes mere shining slits , convulsed with silent merriment . Every detail flashed out clear in that vivid light -- - his red quivering tongue , the lighter pink beneath it , the broad white teeth , the short brown beard cut into a peak and bristling forward.But it was not the sudden flash , it was not the laughing , cruel face , which shot an ice-cold shudder through Francoise de Montespan . It was that , of all men upon earth , this was he whom she most dreaded , and whom she had least thought to see. '' Maurice ! '' she screamed . `` Maurice ! it is you ! `` `` Yes , little wifie , it is I . We are restored to each other 's arms , you see , after this interval . `` `` Oh , Maurice , how you have frightened me ! How could you be so cruel ? Why would you not speak to me ? `` `` Because it was so sweet to sit in silence and
