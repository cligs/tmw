, for not disclosing my identity ? '' he said , laying his hand with a friendly gesture upon the other 's sleeve . `` Had you known me you would have spoken less freely , and I should not have had the opportunity of learning your true worth . For example , you might hardly have been so frank upon the matter of wealth had you known that you were speaking to the master of the Hall . `` `` I do n't think that I was ever so astonished in my life , '' gasped Robert . `` Naturally you are . How could you take me for anything but a workman ? So I am . Chemistry is one of my hobbies , and I spend hours a day in my laboratory yonder . I have only just struck work , and as I had inhaled some not-over-pleasant gases , I thought that a turn down the road and a whiff of tobacco might do me good . That was how I came to meet you , and my toilet , I fear , corresponded only too well with my smoke-grimed face . But I rather fancy I know you by repute . Your name is Robert McIntyre , is it not ? `` `` Yes , though I can not imagine how you knew . `` `` Well , I naturally took some little trouble to learn something of my neighbours . I had heard that there was an artist of that name , and I presume that artists are not very numerous in Tamfield . But how do you like the design ? I hope it does not offend your trained taste . `` `` Indeed , it is wonderful -- -marvellous ! You must yourself have an extraordinary eye for effect . `` `` Oh , I have no taste at all ; not the slightest . I can not tell good from bad . There never was such a complete Philistine . But I had the best man in London down , and another fellow from Vienna . They fixed it up between them . `` They had been standing just within the folding doors upon a huge mat of bison skins . In front of them lay a great square court , paved with many-coloured marbles laid out in a labyrinth of arabesque design . In the centre a high fountain of carved jade shot five thin feathers of spray into the air , four of which curved towards each corner of the court to descend into broad marble basins , while the fifth mounted straight up to an immense height , and then tinkled back into the central reservoir . On either side of the court a tall , graceful palm-tree shot up its slender stem to break into a crown of drooping green leaves some fifty feet above their heads . All round were a series of Moorish arches , in jade and serpentine marble , with heavy curtains of the deepest purple to cover the doors which lay between them . In front , to right and to left , a broad staircase of marble , carpeted with rich thick Smyrna rug work , led upwards to the upper storeys , which were arranged around the central court . The temperature within was warm and yet fresh , like the air of an English May . `` It 's taken from the Alhambra , '' said Raffles Haw . `` The palm-trees are pretty . They strike right through the building into the ground beneath , and their roots are all girt round with hot-water pipes . They seem to thrive very well . `` `` What beautifully delicate brass-work ! '' cried Robert , looking up with admiring eyes at the bright and infinitely fragile metal trellis screens which adorned the spaces between the Moorish arches . `` It is rather neat . But it is not brass-work . Brass is not tough enough to allow them to work it to that degree of fineness . It is gold . But just come this way with me . You wo n't mind waiting while I remove this smoke ? `` He led the way to a door upon the left side of the court , which , to Robert 's surprise , swung slowly open as they approached it . `` That is a little improvement which I have adopted , '' remarked the master of the house . `` As you go up to a door your weight upon the planks releases a spring which causes the hinges to revolve . Pray step in . This is my own little sanctum , and furnished after my own heart . `` If Robert expected to see some fresh exhibition of wealth and luxury he was woefully disappointed , for he found himself in a large but bare room , with a little iron truckle-bed in one corner , a few scattered wooden chairs , a dingy carpet , and a large table heaped with books , bottles , papers , and all the otherdebriswhich collect around a busy and untidy man . Motioning his visitor into a chair , Raffles Haw pulled off his coat , and , turning up the sleeves of his coarse flannel shirt , he began to plunge and scrub in the warm water which flowed from a tap in the wall . `` You see how simple my own tastes are , '' he remarked , as he mopped his dripping face and hair with the towel . `` This is the only room in my great house where I find myself in a congenial atmosphere . It is homely to me . I can read here and smoke my pipe in peace . Anything like luxury is abhorrent to me . `` `` Really , I should not have though it , '' observed Robert . `` It is a fact , I assure you . You see , even with your views as to the worthlessness of wealth , views which , I am sure , are very sensible and much to your credit , you must allow that if a man should happen to be the possessor of vast -- -well , let us say of considerable -- -sums of money , it is his duty to get that money into circulation , so that the community may be the better for it . There is the secret of my fine feathers . I have to exert all my ingenuity in order to spend my income , and yet keep the money in legitimate channels . For example , it is very easy to give money away , and no doubt I could dispose of my surplus , or part of my surplus , in that fashion , but I have no wish to pauperise anyone , or to do mischief by indiscriminate charity . I must exact some sort of money 's worth for all the money which I lay out You see my point , do n't you ? `` `` Entirely ; though really it is something novel to hear a man complain of the difficulty of spending his income . `` `` I assure you that it is a very serious difficulty with me . But I have hit upon some plans -- -some very pretty plans . Will you wash your hands ? Well , then , perhaps you would care to have a look round . Just come into this corner of the room , and sit upon this chair . So . Now I will sit upon this one , and we are ready to start . `` The angle of the chamber in which they sat was painted for about six feet in each direction of a dark chocolate-brown , and was furnished with two red plush seats protruding from the walls , and in striking contrast with the simplicity of the rest of the apartment . `` This , '' remarked Raffles Haw , `` is a lift , though it is so closely joined to the rest of the room that without the change in colour it might puzzle you to find the division . It is made to run either horizontally or vertically . This line of knobs represents the various rooms . You can see 'Dining , ' 'Smoking , ' 'Billiard , ' 'Library ' and so on , upon them . I will show you the upward action . I press this one with 'Kitchen ' upon it . `` There was a sense of motion , a very slight jar , and Robert , without moving from his seat , was conscious that the room had vanished , and that a large arched oaken door stood in the place which it had occupied . `` That is the kitchen door , '' said Raffles Haw . `` I have my kitchen at the top of the house . I can not tolerate the smell of cooking . We have come up eighty feet in a very few seconds . Now I press again and here we are in my room once more . `` Robert McIntyre stared about him in astonishment . `` The wonders of science are greater than those of magic , '' he remarked . `` Yes , it is a pretty little mechanism . Now we try the horizontal . I press the 'Dining ' knob and here we are , you see . Step towards the door , and you will find it open in front of you . `` Robert did as he was bid , and found himself with his companion in a large and lofty room , while the lift , the instant that it was freed from their weight , flashed back to its original position . With his feet sinking into the soft rich carpet , as though he were ankle-deep in some mossy bank , he stared about him at the great pictures which lined the walls . `` Surely , surely , I see Raphael 's touch there , '' he cried , pointing up at the one which faced him . `` Yes , it is a Raphael , and I believe one of his best . I had a very exciting bid for it with the French Government . They wanted it for the Louvre , but of course at an auction the longest purse must win . `` `` And this 'Arrest of Catiline ' must be a Rubens . One can not mistake his splendid men and his infamous women . `` `` Yes , it is a Rubens . The other two are a Velasquez and a Teniers , fair specimens of the Spanish and of the Dutch schools . I have only old masters here . The moderns are in the billiard-room . The furniture here is a little curious . In fact , I fancy that it is unique . It is made of ebony and narwhals ' horns . You see that the legs of everything are of spiral ivory , both the table and the chairs . It cost the upholsterer some little pains , for the supply of these things is a strictly limited one . Curiously enough , the Chinese Emperor had given a large order for narwhals ' horns to repair some ancient pagoda , which was fenced in with them , but I outbid him in the market , and his celestial highness has had to wait . There is a lift here in the corner , but we do not need it . Pray step through this door . This is the billiard-room , '' he continued as they advanced into the adjoining room . `` You see I
