. He slipped into this room because it was the first he came to , and he hid behind the curtain . There he remained until past eleven at night . At that time Mr. Douglas entered the room . It was a short interview , if there were any interview at all ; for Mrs. Douglas declares that her husband had not left her more than a few minutes when she heard the shot . `` `` The candle shows that , '' said Holmes. '' Exactly . The candle , which was a new one , is not burned more than half an inch . He must have placed it on the table before he was attacked ; otherwise , of course , it would have fallen when he fell . This shows that he was not attacked the instant that he entered the room . When Mr. Barker arrived the candle was lit and the lamp was out . `` `` That 's all clear enough . `` `` Well , now , we can reconstruct things on those lines . Mr. Douglas enters the room . He puts down the candle . A man appears from behind the curtain . He is armed with this gun . He demands the wedding ring -- -Heaven only knows why , but so it must have been . Mr. Douglas gave it up . Then either in cold blood or in the course of a struggle -- -Douglas may have gripped the hammer that was found upon the mat -- -he shot Douglas in this horrible way . He dropped his gun and also it would seem this queer card -- -V.V . 341 , whatever that may mean -- -and he made his escape through the window and across the moat at the very moment when Cecil Barker was discovering the crime . How 's that , Mr . Holmes ? `` `` Very interesting , but just a little unconvincing . `` `` Man , it would be absolute nonsense if it was n't that anything else is even worse ! '' cried MacDonald . `` Somebody killed the man , and whoever it was I could clearly prove to you that he should have done it some other way . What does he mean by allowing his retreat to be cut off like that ? What does he mean by using a shotgun when silence was his one chance of escape ? Come , Mr. Holmes , it 's up to you to give us a lead , since you say Mr. White Mason 's theory is unconvincing . `` Holmes had sat intently observant during this long discussion , missing no word that was said , with his keen eyes darting to right and to left , and his forehead wrinkled with speculation . `` I should like a few more facts before I get so far as a theory , Mr. Mac , '' said he , kneeling down beside the body . `` Dear me ! these injuries are really appalling . Can we have the butler in for a moment ? ... Ames , I understand that you have often seen this very unusual mark -- -a branded triangle inside a circle -- -upon Mr. Douglas 's forearm ? `` `` Frequently , sir . `` `` You never heard any speculation as to what it meant ? `` `` No , sir . `` `` It must have caused great pain when it was inflicted . It is undoubtedly a burn . Now , I observe , Ames , that there is a small piece of plaster at the angle of Mr. Douglas 's jaw . Did you observe that in life ? `` `` Yes , sir , he cut himself in shaving yesterday morning . `` `` Did you ever know him to cut himself in shaving before ? `` `` Not for a very long time , sir. '' '' Suggestive ! '' said Holmes . `` It may , of course , be a mere coincidence , or it may point to some nervousness which would indicate that he had reason to apprehend danger . Had you noticed anything unusual in his conduct , yesterday , Ames ? `` `` It struck me that he was a little restless and excited , sir. '' '' Ha ! The attack may not have been entirely unexpected . We do seem to make a little progress , do we not ? Perhaps you would rather do the questioning , Mr . Mac ? `` `` No , Mr. Holmes , it 's in better hands than mine . `` `` Well , then , we will pass to this card -- -V.V . 341 . It is rough cardboard . Have you any of the sort in the house ? `` `` I do n't think so . `` Holmes walked across to the desk and dabbed a little ink from each bottle on to the blotting paper . `` It was not printed in this room , '' he said ; `` this is black ink and the other purplish . It was done by a thick pen , and these are fine . No , it was done elsewhere , I should say . Can you make anything of the inscription , Ames ? `` `` No , sir , nothing . `` `` What do you think , Mr . Mac ? `` `` It gives me the impression of a secret society of some sort ; the same with his badge upon the forearm . `` `` That 's my idea , too , '' said White Mason . `` Well , we can adopt it as a working hypothesis and then see how far our difficulties disappear . An agent from such a society makes his way into the house , waits for Mr. Douglas , blows his head nearly off with this weapon , and escapes by wading the moat , after leaving a card beside the dead man , which will , when mentioned in the papers , tell other members of the society that vengeance has been done . That all hangs together . But why this gun , of all weapons ? '' '' Exactly . `` `` And why the missing ring ? `` `` Quite so . `` `` And why no arrest ? It 's past two now . I take it for granted that since dawn every constable within forty miles has been looking out for a wet stranger ? `` `` That is so , Mr . Holmes . `` `` Well , unless he has a burrow close by or a change of clothes ready , they can hardly miss him . And yet they HAVE missed him up to now ! '' Holmes had gone to the window and was examining with his lens the blood mark on the sill . `` It is clearly the tread of a shoe . It is remarkably broad ; a splay-foot , one would say . Curious , because , so far as one can trace any footmark in this mud-stained corner , one would say it was a more shapely sole . However , they are certainly very indistinct . What 's this under the side table ? '' '' Mr . Douglas 's dumb-bells , '' said Ames . `` Dumb-bell -- -there 's only one . Where 's the other ? `` `` I do n't know , Mr. Holmes . There may have been only one . I have not noticed them for months . `` `` One dumb-bell -- - '' Holmes said seriously ; but his remarks were interrupted by a sharp knock at the door.A tall , sunburned , capable-looking , clean-shaved man looked in at us . I had no difficulty in guessing that it was the Cecil Barker of whom I had heard . His masterful eyes travelled quickly with a questioning glance from face to face . `` Sorry to interrupt your consultation , '' said he , `` but you should hear the latest news . `` `` An arrest ? `` `` No such luck . But they 've found his bicycle . The fellow left his bicycle behind him . Come and have a look . It is within a hundred yards of the hall door . `` We found three or four grooms and idlers standing in the drive inspecting a bicycle which had been drawn out from a clump of evergreens in which it had been concealed . It was a well used Rudge-Whitworth , splashed as from a considerable journey . There was a saddlebag with spanner and oilcan , but no clue as to the owner . `` It would be a grand help to the police , '' said the inspector , `` if these things were numbered and registered . But we must be thankful for what we 've got . If we ca n't find where he went to , at least we are likely to get where he came from . But what in the name of all that is wonderful made the fellow leave it behind ? And how in the world has he got away without it ? We do n't seem to get a gleam of light in the case , Mr . Holmes . `` `` Do n't we ? '' my friend answered thoughtfully . `` I wonder ! `` `` Have you seen all you want of the study ? '' asked White Mason as we reentered the house . `` For the time , '' said the inspector , and Holmes nodded . `` Then perhaps you would now like to hear the evidence of some of the people in the house . We could use the dining room , Ames . Please come yourself first and tell us what you know . `` The butler 's account was a simple and a clear one , and he gave a convincing impression of sincerity . He had been engaged five years before , when Douglas first came to Birlstone . He understood that Mr. Douglas was a rich gentleman who had made his money in America . He had been a kind and considerate employer -- -not quite what Ames was used to , perhaps ; but one ca n't have everything . He never saw any signs of apprehension in Mr. Douglas : on the contrary , he was the most fearless man he had ever known . He ordered the drawbridge to be pulled up every night because it was the ancient custom of the old house , and he liked to keep the old ways up.Mr . Douglas seldom went to London or left the village ; but on the day before the crime he had been shopping at Tunbridge Wells . He ( Ames ) had observed some restlessness and excitement on the part of Mr. Douglas that day ; for he had seemed impatient and irritable , which was unusual with him . He had not gone to bed that night ; but was in the pantry at the back of the house , putting away the silver , when he heard the bell ring violently . He heard no shot ; but it was hardly possible he would , as the pantry and kitchens were at the very back of the house and there were several closed doors and a long passage between . The housekeeper had come out of her room , attracted by the violent ringing of the bell . They had gone to the front of the house together.As they reached the bottom of the stairs he had seen Mrs. Douglas coming down it . No , she was
