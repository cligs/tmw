with their long fantastic shadows looked eerie and unnatural in the yellow glare . `` Are we to have a lantern ? '' asked Burt . `` No , no , '' cried Ezra . `` We shall see quite enough as it is . We do n't want a light . `` `` I have one , '' said the father . `` We can use it if it is necessary . I think we had better take our places now . She may come sooner than we expect . It will be well to leave the door as it is . She will see that there is no obstacle in the way . `` `` You 're not half sharp enough , '' said Ezra . `` If the door was left like that it might suggest a trap to her . Better close the dining-room door and then leave the hall door just a little ajar . That would look more natural . She would conclude that Burt and you were in there . `` `` Where are Jorrocks and Rebecca ? '' Girdlestone asked , closing the door as suggested . `` Jorrocks is in her room . Rebecca , I have no doubt , is in hers also . `` `` Things look safe enough . Come along , Burt . This way . `` The three tramped their way across the gravelled drive and over the slushy grass to the border of the wood . `` This is the withered oak , '' said Girdlestone , as a dark mass loomed in front of them . It stood somewhat apart from the other trees , and the base of it was free from the brambles which formed a thick undergrowth elsewhere.Burt walked round the great trunk and made as careful an examination of the ground as he could in the dark . `` Would the lantern be of any use to you ? '' Girdlestone asked . `` No , It 's all serene . I think I know how to fix it now . You two can get behind those trees , or where you like , as long as you 're not in the way . I do n't want no 'sistance . When Jem Burt takes a job in hand he carries it through in a workmanlike manner . I do n't want nobody else foolin ' around . `` `` We would not dream of interfering with your arrangements , '' saidGirdlestone . `` You 'd better not ! '' Burt growled . `` I 'll lay down behind this oak , d 'ye see . When she comes , she 'll think as he 's not arrived yet , and she 'll get standin ' around and waitin ' . When I see my chance , I 'll get behind her , and she 'll never know that she has not been struck by lightnin'. '' '' Excellent ! '' cried John Girdlestone ; `` excellent ! We had best get into our places . `` `` Mind you do it all in one crack , '' Ezra said . `` Do n't let us have any crying out afterwards . I could stand a good deal , but not that . `` `` You should know how I hits , '' Burt remarked with a malicious grin , which was hidden from his companion . `` If your head was n't well nigh solid you would n't be here now . `` Ezra 's hand involuntarily went up to the old scar . `` I think such a one as that would settle her ! '' he said , as he withdrew with his father . The two took up their position under the shadow of some trees fifty yards off or more . Burt crouched down behind the withered oak with his weapon in his hand and waited for the coming of his victim.Ezra , though usually resolute and daring , had completely lost his nerve , and his teeth were chattering in his head . His father , on the other hand , was emotionless and impassive as ever . `` It 's close upon nine o'clock , '' Ezra whispered . `` Ten minutes to , '' said the other , peering at his great golden chronometer through the darkness . `` What if she fails to come ? `` `` We must devise other means of bringing her out . `` From the spot where they stood they had a view of the whole of the Priory . She could not come out without being seen . Above the door was a long narrow window which opened upon the staircase . On this Girdlestone and his son fixed their eyes , for they knew that on her way down she would be visible at it . As they looked , the dim light which shone through it was obscured and then reappeared . `` She has passed ! '' '' Hush ! `` Another moment and the door was stealthily opened . Once again the broad golden bar shot out across the lawn almost to the spot where the confederates were crouching . In the centre of the zone of light there stood a figure -- -the figure of the girl . Even at that distance they could distinguish the pearl-grey mantle which she usually wore and the close-fitting bonnet . She had wrapped a shawl round the lower part of her face to protect her from the boisterous wind . For a minute or more she stood peering out into the darkness of the night , as though uncertain whether to proceed or to go back . Then , with a quick , sudden gesture she closed the door behind her . The light was no longer there , but they knew that she was outside the house , and that the appointment would be kept.What an age it seemed before they heard her footsteps . She came very slowly , putting one foot gingerly before the other , as if afraid of falling over something in the darkness . Once or twice she stopped altogether , looking round , no doubt , to make sure of her whereabouts . At that instant the moon shone out from behind a cloud , and they saw her dark figure a short distance on . The light enabled her to see the withered oak , for she came rapidly towards it . As she approached , she satisfied herself apparently that she was the first on the ground , for she slackened her pace once more and walked in the listless way that people assume when they are waiting . The clouds were overtaking the moon again , and the light was getting dimmer . `` I can see her still , '' said Ezra in a whisper , grasping his father 's wrist in his excitement.The old man said nothing , but he peered through the darkness with eager , straining eyes . `` There she is , standing out a little from the oak , '' the young merchant said , pointing with a quivering finger . `` She 's not near enough for him to reach her . `` `` He 's coming out from the shadow now , '' the other said huskily . `` Do n't you see him crawling along the ground ? `` `` I see him , '' returned the other in the same subdued , awestruck voice . `` Now he has stopped ; now he goes on again ! My God , he 's close behind her ! She is looking the other way . `` A thin ray of light shot down between the clouds . In its silvery radiance two figures stood out hard and black , that of the unconscious girl and of the man who crouched like a beast of prey behind her . He made a step forward , which brought him within a yard of her . She may have heard the heavy footfall above the shriek of the storm , for she turned suddenly and faced him . At the same instance she was struck down with a crashing blow . There was no time for a prayer , no time for a scream . One moment had seen her a magnificent woman in all the pride of her youthful beauty , the next left her a poor battered , senseless wreck . The navvy had earned his blood-money.At the sound of the blow and the sight of the fall both the old man and the young ran out from their place of concealment . Burt was standing over the body , his bludgeon in his hand . `` Not even a groan ! '' he said . `` What d 'ye think of that ? `` Girdlestone wrung his hand and congratulated him warmly . `` Shall I light the lantern ? '' he asked . `` For God 's sake , do n't ! '' Ezra said earnestly . `` I had no idea that you were so faint-hearted , my son , '' the merchant remarked . `` However , I know the way to the gate well enough to go there blindfold . What a comfort it is to know that there is no blood about ! That 's the advantage of a stick over a knife . `` `` You 're correct there , guv'nor , '' Burt said approvingly . `` Will you kindly carry one end and I 'll take the other . I 'll go first , if you do n't mind , because I know the way best . The train will pass in less than half an hour , so we have not long to wait . Within that time every chance of detection will have gone . `` Girdlestone raised up the head of the murdered girl , and Burt took her feet . Ezra walked behind as though he were in some dreadful dream . He had fully recognized the necessity for the murder , but he had never before realized how ghastly the details would be . Already he had begun to repent that he had ever acquiesced in it . Then came thoughts of the splendid possibilities of the African business , which could only be saved from destruction by this woman 's death . How could he , with his luxurious tastes , bear the squalor and poverty which would be his lot were the firm to fail ? Better a rope and a long drop than such a life as that ! All these considerations thronged into his mind as he plodded along the slippery footpath which led through the forest to the wooden gate.When Tom and the major arrived at Waterloo Station , the latter in the breathless condition described in a preceding chapter , they found the German waiting for them with his two fellow-exiles . The gentleman of Nihilistic proclivities was somewhat tall and thin , with a long frock-coat buttoned almost up to his throat , which showed signs of giving at the seams every here and there . His grizzly hair fell over his collar behind , and he had a short bristling beard . He stood with one hand stuck into the front of his coat and the other upon his hip , as though rehearsing the position in which his statue might be some day erected in the streets of his native Russia , when the people had their own , and despotism was no more . In spite of his worn attire there was something noble and striking about the man . His bow , when Baumser introduced him to the major and Tom , would have graced any Court in Europe . Round
