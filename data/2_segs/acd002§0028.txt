is past to have the upper hand at last . `` I could draw nothing further from him , and he walked , lost in thought , as far as the Baskerville gates . `` Are you coming up ? `` `` Yes ; I see no reason for further concealment . But one last word , Watson . Say nothing of the hound to Sir Henry . Let him think that Selden 's death was as Stapleton would have us believe . He will have a better nerve for the ordeal which he will have to undergo tomorrow , when he is engaged , if I remember your report aright , to dine with these people . `` `` And so am I . `` `` Then you must excuse yourself and he must go alone . That will be easily arranged . And now , if we are too late for dinner , I think that we are both ready for our suppers . `` Sir Henry was more pleased than surprised to see Sherlock Holmes , for he had for some days been expecting that recent events would bring him down from London . He did raise his eyebrows , however , when he found that my friend had neither any luggage nor any explanations for its absence . Between us we soon supplied his wants , and then over a belated supper we explained to the baronet as much of our experience as it seemed desirable that he should know . But first I had the unpleasant duty of breaking the news to Barrymore and his wife . To him it may have been an unmitigated relief , but she wept bitterly in her apron . To all the world he was the man of violence , half animal and half demon ; but to her he always remained the little wilful boy of her own girlhood , the child who had clung to her hand . Evil indeed is the man who has not one woman to mourn him . `` I 've been moping in the house all day since Watson went off in the morning , '' said the baronet . `` I guess I should have some credit , for I have kept my promise . If I had n't sworn not to go about alone I might have had a more lively evening , for I had a message from Stapleton asking me over there . `` `` I have no doubt that you would have had a more lively evening , '' said Holmes drily . `` By the way , I do n't suppose you appreciate that we have been mourning over you as having broken your neck ? `` Sir Henry opened his eyes . `` How was that ? `` `` This poor wretch was dressed in your clothes . I fear your servant who gave them to him may get into trouble with the police . `` `` That is unlikely . There was no mark on any of them , as far as I know . `` `` That 's lucky for him -- -in fact , it 's lucky for all of you , since you are all on the wrong side of the law in this matter . I am not sure that as a conscientious detective my first duty is not to arrest the whole household . Watson 's reports are most incriminating documents . `` `` But how about the case ? '' asked the baronet . `` Have you made anything out of the tangle ? I do n't know that Watson and I are much the wiser since we came down . `` `` I think that I shall be in a position to make the situation rather more clear to you before long . It has been an exceedingly difficult and most complicated business . There are several points upon which we still want light -- -but it is coming all the same . `` `` We 've had one experience , as Watson has no doubt told you . We heard the hound on the moor , so I can swear that it is not all empty superstition . I had something to do with dogs when I was out West , and I know one when I hear one . If you can muzzle that one and put him on a chain I 'll be ready to swear you are the greatest detective of all time . `` `` I think I will muzzle him and chain him all right if you will give me your help . `` `` Whatever you tell me to do I will do . `` `` Very good ; and I will ask you also to do it blindly , without always asking the reason . `` `` Just as you like . `` `` If you will do this I think the chances are that our little problem will soon be solved . I have no doubt -- - '' He stopped suddenly and stared fixedly up over my head into the air . The lamp beat upon his face , and so intent was it and so still that it might have been that of a clear-cut classical statue , a personification of alertness and expectation . `` What is it ? '' we both cried.I could see as he looked down that he was repressing some internal emotion . His features were still composed , but his eyes shone with amused exultation . `` Excuse the admiration of a connoisseur , '' said he as he waved his hand towards the line of portraits which covered the opposite wall . `` Watson wo n't allow that I know anything of art but that is mere jealousy because our views upon the subject differ . Now , these are a really very fine series of portraits . `` `` Well , I 'm glad to hear you say so , '' said Sir Henry , glancing with some surprise at my friend . `` I do n't pretend to know much about these things , and I 'd be a better judge of a horse or a steer than of a picture . I did n't know that you found time for such things . `` `` I know what is good when I see it , and I see it now . That 's a Kneller , I 'll swear , that lady in the blue silk over yonder , and the stout gentleman with the wig ought to be a Reynolds . They are all family portraits , I presume ? `` `` Every one . `` `` Do you know the names ? `` `` Barrymore has been coaching me in them , and I think I can say my lessons fairly well . `` `` Who is the gentleman with the telescope ? `` `` That is Rear-Admiral Baskerville , who served under Rodney in the West Indies . The man with the blue coat and the roll of paper is Sir William Baskerville , who was Chairman of Committees of the House of Commons under Pitt . `` `` And this Cavalier opposite to me -- -the one with the black velvet and the lace ? `` `` Ah , you have a right to know about him . That is the cause of all the mischief , the wicked Hugo , who started the Hound of the Baskervilles . We 're not likely to forget him . `` I gazed with interest and some surprise upon the portrait . `` Dear me ! '' said Holmes , `` he seems a quiet , meek-mannered man enough , but I dare say that there was a lurking devil in his eyes . I had pictured him as a more robust and ruffianly person . `` `` There 's no doubt about the authenticity , for the name and the date , 1647 , are on the back of the canvas . `` Holmes said little more , but the picture of the old roysterer seemed to have a fascination for him , and his eyes were continually fixed upon it during supper . It was not until later , when Sir Henry had gone to his room , that I was able to follow the trend of his thoughts . He led me back into the banqueting-hall , his bedroom candle in his hand , and he held it up against the time-stained portrait on the wall . `` Do you see anything there ? `` I looked at the broad plumed hat , the curling love-locks , the white lace collar , and the straight , severe face which was framed between them . It was not a brutal countenance , but it was prim , hard , and stern , with a firm-set , thin-lipped mouth , and a coldly intolerant eye . `` Is it like anyone you know ? `` `` There is something of Sir Henry about the jaw . `` `` Just a suggestion , perhaps . But wait an instant ! '' He stood upon a chair , and , holding up the light in his left hand , he curved his right arm over the broad hat and round the long ringlets . `` Good heavens ! '' I cried in amazement.The face of Stapleton had sprung out of the canvas . `` Ha , you see it now . My eyes have been trained to examine faces and not their trimmings . It is the first quality of a criminal investigator that he should see through a disguise . `` `` But this is marvellous . It might be his portrait . `` `` Yes , it is an interesting instance of a throwback , which appears to be both physical and spiritual . A study of family portraits is enough to convert a man to the doctrine of reincarnation . The fellow is a Baskerville -- -that is evident . `` `` With designs upon the succession. '' '' Exactly . This chance of the picture has supplied us with one of our most obvious missing links . We have him , Watson , we have him , and I dare swear that before tomorrow night he will be fluttering in our net as helpless as one of his own butterflies . A pin , a cork , and a card , and we add him to the Baker Street collection ! '' He burst into one of his rare fits of laughter as he turned away from the picture . I have not heard him laugh often , and it has always boded ill to somebody.I was up betimes in the morning , but Holmes was afoot earlier still , for I saw him as I dressed , coming up the drive . `` Yes , we should have a full day today , '' he remarked , and he rubbed his hands with the joy of action . `` The nets are all in place , and the drag is about to begin . We 'll know before the day is out whether we have caught our big , leanjawed pike , or whether he has got through the meshes . `` `` Have you been on the moor already ? `` `` I have sent a report from Grimpen to Princetown as to the death of Selden . I think I can promise that none of you will be troubled in the matter . And I have also communicated with my faithful Cartwright , who would certainly have pined away at the door of my hut , as a dog does at his master 's grave , if I had not set his mind at rest about my safety .
