`` Surely I see the red pile of Chandos at the head of yonder squadron ! '' cried Sir Richard Causton , shading his eyes with his hand . `` Not so , '' answered Sir Simon Burley , who had watched the approaching host with a darkening face . `` It is even as I feared . That is the double eagle of Du Guesclin . `` `` You say very truly , '' cried the Earl of Angus . `` These are the levies of France , for I can see the ensigns of the Marshal d'Andreghen , with that of the Lord of Antoing and of Briseuil , and of many another from Brittany and Anjou . `` `` By St. Paul ! I am very glad of it , '' said Sir Nigel . `` Of these Spaniards I know nothing ; but the French are very worthy gentlemen , and will do what they can for our advancement . `` `` There are at the least four thousand of them , and all men-at-arms , '' cried Sir William Felton . `` See , there is Bertrand himself , beside his banner , and there is King Henry , who rides to welcome him . Now they all turn and come into the camp together . `` As he spoke , the vast throng of Spaniards and of Frenchmen trooped across the plain , with brandished arms and tossing banners . All day long the sound of revelry and of rejoicing from the crowded camp swelled up to the ears of the Englishmen , and they could see the soldiers of the two nations throwing themselves into each other 's arms and dancing hand-in-hand round the blazing fires . The sun had sunk behind a cloud-bank in the west before Sir Nigel at last gave word that the men should resume their arms and have their horses ready . He had himself thrown off his armor , and had dressed himself from head to foot in the harness of the captured Spaniard . `` Sir William , '' said he , `` it is my intention to attempt a small deed , and I ask you therefore that you will lead this outfall upon the camp . For me , I will ride into their camp with my squire and two archers . I pray you to watch me , and to ride forth when I am come among the tents . You will leave twenty men behind here , as we planned this morning , and you will ride back here after you have ventured as far as seems good to you . `` `` I will do as you order , Nigel ; but what is it that you propose to do ? `` `` You will see anon , and indeed it is but a trifling matter . Alleyne , you will come with me , and lead a spare horse by the bridle . I will have the two archers who rode with us through France , for they are trusty men and of stout heart . Let them ride behind us , and let them leave their bows here among the bushes for it is not my wish that they should know that we are Englishmen . Say no word to any whom we may meet , and , if any speak to you , pass on as though you heard them not . Are you ready ? `` `` I am ready , my fair lord , '' said Alleyne . `` And I , '' `` And I , '' cried Aylward and John . `` Then the rest I leave to your wisdom , Sir William ; and if God sends us fortune we shall meet you again in this gorge ere it be dark . `` So saying , Sir Nigel mounted the white horse of the Spanish cavalier , and rode quietly forth from his concealment with his three companions behind him , Alleyne leading his master 's own steed by the bridle . So many small parties of French and Spanish horse were sweeping hither and thither that the small band attracted little notice , and making its way at a gentle trot across the plain , they came as far as the camp without challenge or hindrance . On and on they pushed past the endless lines of tents , amid the dense swarms of horsemen and of footmen , until the huge royal pavilion stretched in front of them . They were close upon it when of a sudden there broke out a wild hubbub from a distant portion of the camp , with screams and war-cries and all the wild tumult of battle . At the sound soldiers came rushing from their tents , knights shouted loudly for their squires , and there was mad turmoil on every hand of bewildered men and plunging horses . At the royal tent a crowd of gorgeously dressed servants ran hither and thither in helpless panic for the guard of soldiers who were stationed there had already ridden off in the direction of the alarm . A man-at-arms on either side of the doorway were the sole protectors of the royal dwelling . `` I have come for the king , '' whispered Sir Nigel ; `` and , by Saint Paul ! he must back with us or I must bide here . `` Alleyne and Aylward sprang from their horses , and flew at the two sentries , who were disarmed and beaten down in an instant by so furious and unexpected an attack . Sir Nigel dashed into the royal tent , and was followed by Hordle John as soon as the horses had been secured . From within came wild screamings and the clash of steel , and then the two emerged once more , their swords and forearms reddened with blood , while John bore over his shoulder the senseless body of a man whose gay surcoat , adorned with the lions and towers of Castile , proclaimed him to belong to the royal house . A crowd of white-faced sewers and pages swarmed at their heels , those behind pushing forwards , while the foremost shrank back from the fierce faces and reeking weapons of the adventurers . The senseless body was thrown across the spare horse , the four sprang to their saddles , and away they thundered with loose reins and busy spurs through the swarming camp.But confusion and disorder still reigned among the Spaniards for Sir William Felton and his men had swept through half their camp , leaving a long litter of the dead and the dying to mark their course . Uncertain who were their attackers , and unable to tell their English enemies from their newly-arrived Breton allies , the Spanish knights rode wildly hither and thither in aimless fury . The mad turmoil , the mixture of races , and the fading light , were all in favor of the four who alone knew their own purpose among the vast uncertain multitude . Twice ere they reached open ground they had to break their way through small bodies of horses , and once there came a whistle of arrows and singing of stones about their ears ; but , still dashing onwards , they shot out from among the tents and found their own comrades retreating for the mountains at no very great distance from them . Another five minutes of wild galloping over the plain , and they were all back in their gorge , while their pursuers fell back before the rolling of drums and blare of trumpets , which seemed to proclaim that the whole army of the prince was about to emerge from the mountain passes . `` By my soul ! Nigel , '' cried Sir Oliver , waving a great boiled ham over his head , `` I have come by something which I may eat with my truffles ! I had a hard fight for it , for there were three of them with their mouths open and the knives in their hands , all sitting agape round the table , when I rushed in upon them . How say you , Sir William , will you not try the smack of the famed Spanish swine , though we have but the brook water to wash it down ? `` `` Later , Sir Oliver , '' answered the old soldier , wiping his grimed face . `` We must further into the mountains ere we be in safety . But what have we here , Nigel ? `` `` It is a prisoner whom I have taken , and in sooth , as he came from the royal tent and wears the royal arms upon his jupon , I trust that he is the King of Spain . `` `` The King of Spain ! '' cried the companions , crowding round in amazement . `` Nay , Sir Nigel , '' said Felton , peering at the prisoner through the uncertain light , `` I have twice seen Henry of Transtamare , and certes this man in no way resembles him . `` `` Then , by the light of heaven ! I will ride back for him , '' cried Sir Nigel . `` Nay , nay , the camp is in arms , and it would be rank madness . Who are you , fellow ? '' he added in Spanish , `` and how is it that you dare to wear the arms of Castile ? `` The prisoner was bent recovering the consciousness which had been squeezed from him by the grip of Hordle John . `` If it please you , '' he answered , `` I and nine others are the body-squires of the king , and must ever wear his arms , so as to shield him from even such perils as have threatened him this night . The king is at the tent of the brave Du Guesclin , where he will sup to night . But I am a caballero of Aragon , Don Sancho Penelosa , and , though I be no king , I am yet ready to pay a fitting price for my ransom . `` `` By Saint Paul ! I will not touch your gold , '' cried Sir Nigel . `` Go back to your master and give him greeting from Sir Nigel Loring of Twynham Castle , telling him that I had hoped to make his better acquaintance this night , and that , if I have disordered his tent , it was but in my eagerness to know so famed and courteous a knight . Spur on , comrades ! for we must cover many a league ere we can venture to light fire or to loosen girth . I had hoped to ride without this patch to-night , but it seems that I must carry it yet a little longer . `` It was a cold , bleak morning in the beginning of March , and the mist was drifting in dense rolling clouds through the passes of the Cantabrian mountains . The Company , who had passed the night in a sheltered gully , were already astir , some crowding round the blazing fires and others romping or leaping over each other 's backs for their limbs were chilled and the air biting . Here and there , through the dense haze which surrounded them , there loomed out huge pinnacles and jutting boulders of rock : while high above the sea of vapor there towered up one gigantic peak , with the pink glow of the early sunshine upon its snow-capped head . The ground was wet , the rocks dripping ,
