he bore a huge bundle of canvas with two long sticks projecting from it , and under each arm he carried what appeared to be a large square painting . `` He 's no Injun , '' whispered Amos , `` and he 's no Woodsman either.Blessed if I ever saw the match of him ! `` `` He 's neithervoyageur , nor soldier , norcoureur-de-bois , '' said DeCatinat . `` 'Pears to me to have a jurymast rigged upon his back , and fore and main staysails set under each of his arms , '' said Captain Ephraim . `` Well , he seems to have no consorts , so we may hail him without fear . `` They rose from their ambush , and as they did so the stranger caught sight of them . Instead of showing the uneasiness which any man might be expected to feel at suddenly finding himself in the presence of strangers in such a country , he promptly altered his course and came towards them . As he crossed the glade , however , the sounds of the distant bell fell upon his ears , and he instantly whipped off his hat and sunk his head in prayer . A cry of horror rose , not only from Adele but from everyone of the party , at the sight which met their eyes.The top of the man 's head was gone . Not a vestige of hair or of white skin remained , but in place of it was a dreadful crinkled discoloured surface with a sharp red line running across his brow and round over his ears . `` By the eternal ! '' cried Amos , `` the man has lost his scalp ! `` `` My God ! '' said De Catinat . `` Look at his hands ! `` He had raised them in prayer . Two or three little stumps projecting upwards showed where the fingers had been . `` I 've seen some queer figure-heads in my life , but never one like that , '' said Captain Ephraim.It was indeed a most extraordinary face which confronted them as they advanced . It was that of a man who might have been of any age and of any nation , for the features were so distorted that nothing could be learned from them . One eyelid was drooping with a puckering and flatness which showed that the ball was gone . The other , however , shot as bright and merry and kindly a glance as ever came from a chosen favourite of fortune . His face was flecked over with peculiar brown spots which had a most hideous appearance , and his nose had been burst and shattered by some terrific blow . And yet , in spite of this dreadful appearance , there was something so noble in the carriage of the man , in the pose of his head and in the expression which still hung , like the scent from a crushed flower , round his distorted features , that even the blunt Puritan seaman was awed by it . `` Good-evening , my children , '' said the stranger , picking up his pictures again and advancing towards them . `` I presume that you are from the fort , though I may be permitted to observe that the woods are not very safe for ladies at present . `` `` We are going to the manor-house of Charles de la Noue at Sainte Marie , '' said De Catinat , `` and we hope soon to be in a place of safety . But I grieve , sir , to see how terribly you have been mishandled . `` `` Ah , you have observed my little injuries , then ! They know no better , poor souls . They are but mischievous children -- -merry-hearted but mischievous . Tut , tut , it is laughable indeed that a man 's vile body should ever clog his spirit , and yet here am I full of the will to push forward , and yet I must even seat myself on this log and rest myself , for the rogues have blown the calves of my legs off . `` `` My God ! Blown them off ! The devils ! `` `` Ah , but they are not to be blamed . No , no , it would be uncharitable to blame them . They are ignorant poor folk , and the prince of darkness is behind them to urge them on . They sank little charges of powder into my legs and then they exploded them , which makes me a slower walker than ever , though I was never very brisk . 'The Snail ' was what I was called at school in Tours , yes , and afterwards at the seminary I was always 'the Snail . ' '' '' Who are you then , sir , and who is it who has used you so shamefully ? '' asked De Catinat . `` Oh , I am a very humble person . I am Ignatius Morat , of the Society of Jesus , and as to the people who have used me a little roughly , why , if you are sent upon the Iroquois mission , of course you know what to expect . I have nothing at all to complain of . Why , they have used me very much better than they did Father Jogues , Father Breboeuf , and a good many others whom I could mention . There were times , it is true , when I was quite hopeful of martyrdom , especially when they thought my tonsure was too small , which was their merry way of putting it . But I suppose I was not worthy of it ; indeed I know that I was not , so it only ended in just a little roughness . `` `` Where are you going then ? '' asked Amos , who had listened in amazement to the man 's words . `` I am going to Quebec . You see I am such a useless person that , until I have seen the bishop , I can really do no good at all . `` `` You mean that you will resign your mission into the bishop 's hands ? '' said De Catinat . `` Oh , no . That would be quite the sort of thing which I should do if I were left to myself , for it is incredible how cowardly I am . You would not think it possible that a priest of God could be so frightened as I am sometimes . The mere sight of a fire makes me shrink all into myself ever since I went through the ordeal of the lighted pine splinters , which have left all these ugly stains upon my face . But then , of course , there is the Order to be thought of , and members of the Order do not leave their posts for trifling causes . But it is against the rules of Holy Church that a maimed man should perform the rites , and so , until I have seen the bishop and had his dispensation , I shall be even more useless than ever . `` `` And what will you do then ? `` `` Oh , then , of course , I will go back to my flock . `` `` To the Iroquois ! `` `` That is where I am stationed . `` `` Amos , '' said De Catinat , `` I have spent my life among brave men , but I think that this is the bravest man that I have ever met ! `` `` On my word , '' said Amos , `` I have seen some good men , too , but never one that I thought was better than this . You are weary , father . Have some of our cold goose , and there is still a drop of cognac in my flask . `` `` Tut , tut , my son , if I take anything but the very simplest living it makes me so lazy that I become a snail indeed . `` `` But you have no gun and no food . How do you live ? `` `` Oh , the good God has placed plenty of food in these forests for a traveller who dare not eat very much . I have had wild plums , and wild grapes , and nuts and cranberries , and a nice little dish oftripe-de-merefrom the rocks . `` The woodsman made a wry face at the mention of this delicacy . `` I had as soon eat a pot of glue , '' said he . `` But what is this which you carry on your back ? `` `` It is my church . Ah , I have everything here , tent , altar , surplice , everything . I can not venture to celebrate service myself without the dispensation , but surely this venerable man is himself in orders and will solemnise the most blessed function . `` Amos , with a sly twinkle of the eyes , translated the proposal to Ephraim , who stood with his huge red hands clenched , mumbling about the saltless pottage of papacy . De Catinat replied briefly , however , that they were all of the laity , and that if they were to reach their destination before nightfall , it was necessary that they should push on . `` You are right , my son , '' said the little Jesuit . `` These poor people have already left their villages , and in a few days the woods will be full of them , though I do not think that any have crossed the Richelieu yet . There is one thing , however , which I would have you do for me . `` `` And what is that ? `` `` It is but to remember that I have left with Father Lamberville at Onondaga the dictionary which I have made of the Iroquois and French languages . There also is my account of the copper mines of the Great Lakes which I visited two years ago , and also an orrery which I have made to show the northern heavens with the stars of each month as they are seen from this meridian . If aught were to go amiss with Father Lamberville or with me , and we do not live very long on the Iroquois mission , it would be well that some one else should profit from my work . `` `` I will tell my friend to-night . But what are these great pictures , father , and why do you bear them through the wood ? '' He turned them over as he spoke , and the whole party gathered round them , staring in amazement.They were very rough daubs , crudely coloured and gaudy . In the first , a red man was reposing serenely upon what appeared to be a range of mountains , with a musical instrument in his hand , a crown upon his head , and a smile upon his face . In the second , a similar man was screaming at the pitch of his lungs , while half-a-dozen black creatures were battering him with poles and prodding him with lances . `` It is a damned soul and a saved soul , '' said Father Ignatius Morat , looking at his pictures with some satisfaction . `` These are clouds upon which the blessed spirit reclines , basking in all the joys of paradise . It is well done
