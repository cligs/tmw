from one side of the road to the other , and he stared and pondered and nodded his head like a traveller who makes his notes and saves them up for the re-telling . `` By the rood ! '' he broke out suddenly , slapping his thigh with his great red hand , `` I knew that there was something a-missing , but I could not bring to my mind what it was . `` `` What was it then ? '' asked Alleyne , coming with a start out of his reverie . `` Why , it is the hedgerows , '' roared John , with a shout of laughter . `` The country is all scraped as clear as a friar 's poll . But indeed I can not think much of the folk in these parts . Why do they not get to work and dig up these long rows of black and crooked stumps which I see on every hand ? A franklin of Hampshire would think shame to have such litter upon his soil . `` `` Thou foolish old John ! '' quoth Aylward . `` You should know better , since I have heard that the monks of Beaulieu could squeeze a good cup of wine from their own grapes . Know then that if these rows were dug up the wealth of the country would be gone , and mayhap there would be dry throats and gaping mouths in England , for in three months ' time these black roots will blossom and shoot and burgeon , and from them will come many a good ship-load of Medoc and Gascony which will cross the narrow seas . But see the church in the hollow , and the folk who cluster in the churchyard ! By my hilt ! it is a burial , and there is a passing bell ! '' He pulled off his steel cap as he spoke and crossed himself , with a muttered prayer for the repose of the dead . `` There too , '' remarked Alleyne , as they rode on again , `` that which seems to the eye to be dead is still full of the sap of life , even as the vines were . Thus God hath written Himself and His laws very broadly on all that is around us , if our poor dull eyes and duller souls could but read what He hath set before us. '' '' Ha ! mon petit , '' cried the bowman , `` you take me back to the days when you were new fledged , as sweet a little chick as ever pecked his way out of a monkish egg . I had feared that in gaining our debonair young man-at-arms we had lost our soft-spoken clerk . In truth , I have noted much change in you since we came from Twynham Castle . `` `` Surely it would be strange else , seeing that I have lived in a world so new to me . Yet I trust that there are many things in which I have not changed . If I have turned to serve an earthly master , and to carry arms for an earthly king , it would be an ill thing if I were to lose all thought of the great high King and Master of all , whose humble and unworthy servant I was ere ever I left Beaulieu . You , John , are also from the cloisters , but I trow that you do not feel that you have deserted the old service in taking on the new . `` `` I am a slow-witted man , '' said John , `` and , in sooth , when I try to think about such matters it casts a gloom upon me . Yet I do not look upon myself as a worse man in an archer 's jerkin than I was in a white cowl , if that be what you mean . `` `` You have but changed from one white company to the other , '' quoth Aylward . `` But , by these ten finger-bones ! it is a passing strange thing to me to think that it was but in the last fall of the leaf that we walked from Lyndhurst together , he so gentle and maidenly , and you , John , like a great red-limbed overgrown moon-calf ; and now here you are as sprack a squire and as lusty an archer as ever passed down the highway from Bordeaux , while I am still the same old Samkin Aylward , with never a change , save that I have a few more sins on my soul and a few less crowns in my pouch . But I have never yet heard , John , what the reason was why you should come out of Beaulieu . `` `` There were seven reasons , '' said John thoughtfully . `` The first of them was that they threw me out . `` `` Ma foi ! camarade , to the devil with the other six ! That is enough for me and for thee also . I can see that they are very wise and discreet folk at Beaulieu . Ah ! mon ange , what have you in the pipkin ? `` `` It is milk , worthy sir , '' answered the peasant-maid , who stood by the door of a cottage with a jug in her hand . `` Would it please you , gentles , that I should bring you out three horns of it ? `` `` Nay , ma petite , but here is a two-sous piece for thy kindly tongue and for the sight of thy pretty face . Ma foi ! but she has a bonne mine . I have a mind to bide and speak with her . `` `` Nay , nay , Aylward , '' cried Alleyne . `` Sir Nigel will await us , and he in haste . `` `` True , true , camarade ! Adieu , ma cherie ! mon coeur est toujours a toi . Her mother is a well-grown woman also . See where she digs by the wayside . Ma foi ! the riper fruit is ever the sweeter . Bon jour , ma belle dame ! God have you in his keeping ! Said Sir Nigel where he would await us ? `` `` At Marmande or Aiguillon . He said that we could not pass him , seeing that there is but the one road . `` `` Aye , and it is a road that I know as I know the Midhurst parish butts , '' quoth the bowman . `` Thirty times have I journeyed it , forward and backward , and , by the twang of string ! I am wont to come back this way more laden than I went . I have carried all that I had into France in a wallet , and it hath taken four sumpter-mules to carry it back again . God 's benison on the man who first turned his hand to the making of war ! But there , down in the dingle , is the church of Cardillac , and you may see the inn where three poplars grow beyond the village . Let us on , for a stoup of wine would hearten us upon our way . `` The highway had lain through the swelling vineyard country , which stretched away to the north and east in gentle curves , with many a peeping spire and feudal tower , and cluster of village houses , all clear cut and hard in the bright wintry air . To their right stretched the blue Garonne , running swiftly seawards , with boats and barges dotted over its broad bosom . On the other side lay a strip of vineyard , and beyond it the desolate and sandy region of the Landes , all tangled with faded gorse and heath and broom , stretching away in unbroken gloom to the blue hills which lay low upon the furthest sky-line . Behind them might still be seen the broad estuary of the Gironde , with the high towers of Saint Andre and Saint Remi shooting up from the plain . In front , amid radiating lines of poplars , lay the riverside townlet of Cardillac -- -gray walls , white houses , and a feather of blue smoke . `` This is the 'Mouton d'Or , ' '' said Aylward , as they pulled up their horses at a whitewashed straggling hostel . `` What ho there ! '' he continued , beating upon the door with the hilt of his sword . `` Tapster , ostler , varlet , hark hither , and a wannion on your lazy limbs ! Ha ! Michel , as red in the nose as ever ! Three jacks of the wine of the country , Michel -- -for the air bites shrewdly . I pray you , Alleyne , to take note of this door , for I have a tale concerning it . `` `` Tell me , friend , '' said Alleyne to the portly red-faced inn-keeper , `` has a knight and a squire passed this way within the hour ? `` `` Nay , sir , it would be two hours back . Was he a small man , weak in the eyes , with a want of hair , and speaks very quiet when he is most to be feared ? `` `` The same , '' the squire answered . `` But I marvel how you should know how he speaks when he is in wrath , for he is very gentle-minded with those who are beneath him . `` `` Praise to the saints ! it was not I who angered him , '' said the fat Michel . `` Who , then ? `` `` It was young Sieur de Crespigny of Saintonge , who chanced to be here , and made game of the Englishman , seeing that he was but a small man and hath a face which is full of peace . But indeed this good knight was a very quiet and patient man , for he saw that the Sieur de Crespigny was still young and spoke from an empty head , so he sat his horse and quaffed his wine , even as you are doing now , all heedless of the clacking tongue . `` `` And what then , Michel ? `` `` Well , messieurs , it chanced that the Sieur de Crespigny , having said this and that , for the laughter of the varlets , cried out at last about the glove that the knight wore in his coif , asking if it was the custom in England for a man to wear a great archer 's glove in his cap . Pardieu ! I have never seen a man get off his horse as quick as did that stranger Englishman . Ere the words were past the other 's lips he was beside him , his face nigh touching , and his breath hot upon his cheeks . 'I think , young sir , ' quoth he softly , looking into the other 's eyes , 'that now that I am nearer you will very clearly see that the glove is not an archer 's glove . ' 'Perchance not , ' said the Sieur de Crespigny with a twitching lip . 'Nor is it large , but very small , ' quoth the Englishman . 'Less large than I had thought , ' said the other , looking down , for the knight 's gaze was heavy upon his
