ice in his bosom . `` My father has broad acres , '' the other continued , `` from Fareham Creek to the slope of the Portsdown Hill . There is filling of granges , hewing of wood , malting of grain , and herding of sheep as much as heart could wish , and I the only son . Sure am I that Sir Nigel would be blithe at such a match . `` `` But how of the lady ? '' asked Alleyne , with dry lips . `` Ah , lad , there lies my trouble . It is a toss of the head and a droop of the eyes if I say one word of what is in my mind . 'Twere as easy to woo the snow-dame that we shaped last winter in our castle yard . I did but ask her yesternight for her green veil , that I might bear it as a token or lambrequin upon my helm ; but she flashed out at me that she kept it for a better man , and then all in a breath asked pardon for that she had spoke so rudely . Yet she would not take back the words either , nor would she grant the veil . Has it seemed to thee , Alleyne , that she loves any one ? `` `` Nay , I can not say , '' said Alleyne , with a wild throb of sudden hope in his heart . `` I have thought so , and yet I can not name the man . Indeed , save myself , and Walter Ford , and you , who are half a clerk , and Father Christopher of the Priory , and Bertrand the page , who is there whom she sees ? `` `` I can not tell , '' quoth Alleyne shortly ; and the two squires rode on again , each intent upon his own thoughts.Next day at morning lesson the teacher observed that his pupil was indeed looking pale and jaded , with listless eyes and a weary manner . He was heavy-hearted to note the grievous change in her . `` Your mistress , I fear , is ill , Agatha , '' he said to the tire-woman , when the Lady Maude had sought her chamber.The maid looked aslant at him with laughing eyes . `` It is not an illness that kills , '' quoth she . `` Pray God not ! '' he cried . `` But tell me , Agatha , what it is that ails her ? `` `` Methinks that I could lay my hand upon another who is smitten with the same trouble , '' said she , with the same sidelong look . `` Canst not give a name to it , and thou so skilled in leech-craft ? `` `` Nay , save that she seems aweary . `` `` Well , bethink you that it is but three days ere you will all be gone , and Castle Twynham be as dull as the Priory . Is there not enough there to cloud a lady 's brow ? `` `` In sooth , yes , '' he answered ; `` I had forgot that she is about to lose her father . `` `` Her father ! '' cried the tire-woman , with a little trill of laughter . `` Oh simple , simple ! '' And she was off down the passage like arrow from bow , while Alleyne stood gazing after her , betwixt hope and doubt , scarce daring to put faith in the meaning which seemed to underlie her words.St . Luke 's day had come and had gone , and it was in the season of Martinmas , when the oxen are driven in to the slaughter , that the White Company was ready for its journey . Loud shrieked the brazen bugles from keep and from gateway , and merry was the rattle of the war-drum , as the men gathered in the outer bailey , with torches to light them , for the morn had not yet broken . Alleyne , from the window of the armory , looked down upon the strange scene -- -the circles of yellow flickering light , the lines of stern and bearded faces , the quick shimmer of arms , and the lean heads of the horses . In front stood the bow-men , ten deep , with a fringe of under-officers , who paced hither and thither marshalling the ranks with curt precept or short rebuke . Behind were the little clump of steel-clad horsemen , their lances raised , with long pensils drooping down the oaken shafts . So silent and still were they , that they might have been metal-sheathed statues , were it not for the occasional quick , impatient stamp of their chargers , or the rattle of chamfron against neck-plates as they tossed and strained . A spear 's length in front of them sat the spare and long-limbed figure of Black Simon , the Norwich fighting man , his fierce , deep-lined face framed in steel , and the silk guidon marked with the five scarlet roses slanting over his right shoulder . All round , in the edge of the circle of the light , stood the castle servants , the soldiers who were to form the garrison , and little knots of women , who sobbed in their aprons and called shrilly to their name-saints to watch over the Wat , or Will , or Peterkin who had turned his hand to the work of war.The young squire was leaning forward , gazing at the stirring and martial scene , when he heard a short , quick gasp at his shoulder , and there was the Lady Maude , with her hand to her heart , leaning up against the wall , slender and fair , like a half-plucked lily . Her face was turned away from him , but he could see , by the sharp intake of her breath , that she was weeping bitterly. '' Alas ! alas ! '' he cried , all unnerved at the sight , `` why is it that you are so sad , lady ? `` `` It is the sight of these brave men , '' she answered ; `` and to think how many of them go and how few are like to find their way back . I have seen it before , when I was a little maid , in the year of the Prince 's great battle . I remember then how they mustered in the bailey , even as they do now , and my lady-mother holding me in her arms at this very window that I might see the show . `` `` Please God , you will see them all back ere another year be out , '' said he.She shook her head , looking round at him with flushed cheeks and eyes that sparkled in the lamp-light . `` Oh , but I hate myself for being a woman ! '' she cried , with a stamp of her little foot . `` What can I do that is good ? Here I must bide , and talk and sew and spin , and spin and sew and talk . Ever the same dull round , with nothing at the end of it . And now you are going too , who could carry my thoughts out of these gray walls , and raise my mind above tapestry and distaffs . What can I do ? I am of no more use or value than that broken bowstave . `` `` You are of such value to me , '' he cried , in a whirl of hot , passionate words , `` that all else has become nought . You are my heart , my life , my one and only thought . Oh , Maude , I can not live without you , I can not leave you without a word of love . All is changed to me since I have known you . I am poor and lowly and all unworthy of you ; but if great love may weigh down such defects , then mine may do it . Give me but one word of hope to take to the wars with me -- -but one . Ah , you shrink , you shudder ! My wild words have frightened you . `` Twice she opened her lips , and twice no sound came from them . At last she spoke in a hard and measured voice , as one who dare not trust herself to speak too freely . `` This is over sudden , '' she said ; `` it is not so long since the world was nothing to you . You have changed once ; perchance you may change again. '' '' Cruel ! '' he cried , `` who hath changed me ? `` `` And then your brother , '' she continued with a little laugh , disregarding his question . `` Methinks this hath become a family custom amongst the Edricsons . Nay , I am sorry ; I did not mean a jibe . But , indeed , Alleyne , this hath come suddenly upon me , and I scarce know what to say . `` `` Say some word of hope , however distant -- -some kind word that I may cherish in my heart . `` `` Nay , Alleyne , it were a cruel kindness , and you have been too good and true a friend to me that I should use you despitefully . There can not be a closer link between us . It is madness to think of it . Were there no other reasons , it is enough that my father and your brother would both cry out against it . `` `` My brother , what has he to do with it ? And your father -- -- -- '' '' Come , Alleyne , was it not you who would have me act fairly to all men , and , certes , to my father amongst them ? `` `` You say truly , '' he cried , `` you say truly . But you do not reject me , Maude ? You give me some ray of hope ? I do not ask pledge or promise . Say only that I am not hateful to you -- -that on some happier day I may hear kinder words from you . `` Her eyes softened upon him , and a kind answer was on her lips , when a hoarse shout , with the clatter of arms and stamping of steeds , rose up from the bailey below . At the sound her face set her eyes sparkled , and she stood with flushed cheek and head thrown back -- -a woman 's body , with a soul of fire . `` My father hath gone down , '' she cried . `` Your place is by his side . Nay , look not at me , Alleyne . It is no time for dallying . Win my father 's love , and all may follow . It is when the brave soldier hath done his devoir that he hopes for his reward . Farewell , and may God be with you ! '' She held out her white , slim hand to him , but as he bent his lips over it she whisked away and was gone , leaving in his outstretched hand the very green veil for which poor Peter Terlake had craved in vain . Again the hoarse cheering burst out from below , and he heard
