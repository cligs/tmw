entered his eyes fell upon the stick in Holmes 's hand , and he ran towards it with an exclamation of joy . `` I am so very glad , '' said he . `` I was not sure whether I had left it here or in the Shipping Office . I would not lose that stick for the world . `` `` A presentation , I see , '' said Holmes . `` Yes , sir . `` `` From Charing Cross Hospital ? `` `` From one or two friends there on the occasion of my marriage . `` `` Dear , dear , that 's bad ! '' said Holmes , shaking his head.Dr . Mortimer blinked through his glasses in mild astonishment . `` Why was it bad ? `` `` Only that you have disarranged our little deductions . Your marriage , you say ? `` `` Yes , sir . I married , and so left the hospital , and with it all hopes of a consulting practice . It was necessary to make a home of my own . `` `` Come , come , we are not so far wrong , after all , '' said Holmes . `` And now , Dr. James Mortimer -- - '' '' Mister , sir , Mister -- -a humble M.R.C.S . `` `` And a man of precise mind , evidently . `` `` A dabbler in science , Mr. Holmes , a picker up of shells on the shores of the great unknown ocean . I presume that it is Mr. Sherlock Holmes whom I am addressing and not -- - '' '' No , this is my friend Dr . Watson . `` `` Glad to meet you , sir . I have heard your name mentioned in connection with that of your friend . You interest me very much , Mr. Holmes . I had hardly expected so dolichocephalic a skull or such well-marked supra-orbital development . Would you have any objection to my running my finger along your parietal fissure ? A cast of your skull , sir , until the original is available , would be an ornament to any anthropological museum . It is not my intention to be fulsome , but I confess that I covet your skull . `` Sherlock Holmes waved our strange visitor into a chair . `` You are an enthusiast in your line of thought , I perceive , sir , as I am in mine , '' said he . `` I observe from your forefinger that you make your own cigarettes . Have no hesitation in lighting one . `` The man drew out paper and tobacco and twirled the one up in the other with surprising dexterity . He had long , quivering fingers as agile and restless as the antennae of an insect.Holmes was silent , but his little darting glances showed me the interest which he took in our curious companion . `` I presume , sir , '' said he at last , `` that it was not merely for the purpose of examining my skull that you have done me the honour to call here last night and again today ? `` `` No , sir , no ; though I am happy to have had the opportunity of doing that as well . I came to you , Mr. Holmes , because I recognized that I am myself an unpractical man and because I am suddenly confronted with a most serious and extraordinary problem . Recognizing , as I do , that you are the second highest expert in Europe -- - '' '' Indeed , sir ! May I inquire who has the honour to be the first ? '' asked Holmes with some asperity . `` To the man of precisely scientific mind the work of Monsieur Bertillon must always appeal strongly . `` `` Then had you not better consult him ? `` `` I said , sir , to the precisely scientific mind . But as a practical man of affairs it is acknowledged that you stand alone . I trust , sir , that I have not inadvertently -- - '' '' Just a little , '' said Holmes . `` I think , Dr. Mortimer , you would do wisely if without more ado you would kindly tell me plainly what the exact nature of the problem is in which you demand my assistance . `` `` I have in my pocket a manuscript , '' said Dr. James Mortimer . `` I observed it as you entered the room , '' said Holmes . `` It is an old manuscript . `` `` Early eighteenth century , unless it is a forgery . `` `` How can you say that , sir ? `` `` You have presented an inch or two of it to my examination all the time that you have been talking . It would be a poor expert who could not give the date of a document within a decade or so . You may possibly have read my little monograph upon the subject . I put that at 1730 . `` `` The exact date is 1742 . '' Dr. Mortimer drew it from his breast-pocket . `` This family paper was committed to my care by Sir Charles Baskerville , whose sudden and tragic death some three months ago created so much excitement in Devonshire . I may say that I was his personal friend as well as his medical attendant . He was a strong-minded man , sir , shrewd , practical , and as unimaginative as I am myself . Yet he took this document very seriously , and his mind was prepared for just such an end as did eventually overtake him . `` Holmes stretched out his hand for the manuscript and flattened it upon his knee . `` You will observe , Watson , the alternative use of the long s and the short . It is one of several indications which enabled me to fix the date . `` I looked over his shoulder at the yellow paper and the faded script . At the head was written : `` Baskerville Hall , '' and below in large , scrawling figures : `` 1742 . `` `` It appears to be a statement of some sort . `` `` Yes , it is a statement of a certain legend which runs in the Baskerville family . `` `` But I understand that it is something more modern and practical upon which you wish to consult me ? `` `` Most modern . A most practical , pressing matter , which must be decided within twenty-four hours . But the manuscript is short and is intimately connected with the affair . With your permission I will read it to you . `` Holmes leaned back in his chair , placed his finger-tips together , and closed his eyes , with an air of resignation . Dr. Mortimer turned the manuscript to the light and read in a high , cracking voice the following curious , old-world narrative : '' Of the origin of the Hound of the Baskervilles there have been many statements , yet as I come in a direct line from Hugo Baskerville , and as I had the story from my father , who also had it from his , I have set it down with all belief that it occurred even as is here set forth . And I would have you believe , my sons , that the same Justice which punishes sin may also most graciously forgive it , and that no ban is so heavy but that by prayer and repentance it may be removed . Learn then from this story not to fear the fruits of the past , but rather to be circumspect in the future , that those foul passions whereby our family has suffered so grievously may not again be loosed to our undoing . `` Know then that in the time of the Great Rebellion ( the history of which by the learned Lord Clarendon I most earnestly commend to your attention ) this Manor of Baskerville was held by Hugo of that name , nor can it be gainsaid that he was a most wild , profane , and godless man . This , in truth , his neighbours might have pardoned , seeing that saints have never flourished in those parts , but there was in him a certain wanton and cruel humour which made his name a by-word through the West . It chanced that this Hugo came to love ( if , indeed , so dark a passion may be known under so bright a name ) the daughter of a yeoman who held lands near the Baskerville estate . But the young maiden , being discreet and of good repute , would ever avoid him , for she feared his evil name . So it came to pass that one Michaelmas this Hugo , with five or six of his idle and wicked companions , stole down upon the farm and carried off the maiden , her father and brothers being from home , as he well knew . When they had brought her to the Hall the maiden was placed in an upper chamber , while Hugo and his friends sat down to a long carouse , as was their nightly custom . Now , the poor lass upstairs was like to have her wits turned at the singing and shouting and terrible oaths which came up to her from below , for they say that the words used by Hugo Baskerville , when he was in wine , were such as might blast the man who said them . At last in the stress of her fear she did that which might have daunted the bravest or most active man , for by the aid of the growth of ivy which covered ( and still covers ) the south wall she came down from under the eaves , and so homeward across the moor , there being three leagues betwixt the Hall and her father 's farm . `` It chanced that some little time later Hugo left his guests to carry food and drink -- -with other worse things , perchance -- -to his captive , and so found the cage empty and the bird escaped . Then , as it would seem , he became as one that hath a devil , for , rushing down the stairs into the dining-hall , he sprang upon the great table , flagons and trenchers flying before him , and he cried aloud before all the company that he would that very night render his body and soul to the Powers of Evil if he might but overtake the wench . And while the revellers stood aghast at the fury of the man , one more wicked or , it may be , more drunken than the rest , cried out that they should put the hounds upon her . Whereat Hugo ran from the house , crying to his grooms that they should saddle his mare and unkennel the pack , and giving the hounds a kerchief of the maid 's , he swung them to the line , and so off full cry in the moonlight over the moor . `` Now , for some space the revellers stood agape , unable to understand all that had been done in such haste . But anon their bemused wits awoke to the nature of the deed which was like to be done upon the moorlands . Everything was now in an uproar , some calling for their pistols , some for their horses , and some for
