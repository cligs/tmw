hand were remarkably long . These are only a few indications , but they may assist you . `` Lestrade and Gregson glanced at each other with an incredulous smile . `` If this man was murdered , how was it done ? '' asked the former . `` Poison , '' said Sherlock Holmes curtly , and strode off . `` One other thing , Lestrade , '' he added , turning round at the door : `` 'Rache , ' is the German for 'revenge ; ' so do n't lose your time looking for Miss Rachel . `` With which Parthian shot he walked away , leaving the two rivals open-mouthed behind him.IT was one o'clock when we left No . 3 , Lauriston Gardens . Sherlock Holmes led me to the nearest telegraph office , whence he dispatched a long telegram . He then hailed a cab , and ordered the driver to take us to the address given us by Lestrade . `` There is nothing like first hand evidence , '' he remarked ; `` as a matter of fact , my mind is entirely made up upon the case , but still we may as well learn all that is to be learned . `` `` You amaze me , Holmes , '' said I . `` Surely you are not as sure as you pretend to be of all those particulars which you gave . `` `` There 's no room for a mistake , '' he answered . `` The very first thing which I observed on arriving there was that a cab had made two ruts with its wheels close to the curb . Now , up to last night , we have had no rain for a week , so that those wheels which left such a deep impression must have been there during the night . There were the marks of the horse 's hoofs , too , the outline of one of which was far more clearly cut than that of the other three , showing that that was a new shoe . Since the cab was there after the rain began , and was not there at any time during the morning -- -I have Gregson 's word for that -- -it follows that it must have been there during the night , and , therefore , that it brought those two individuals to the house . `` `` That seems simple enough , '' said I ; `` but how about the other man 's height ? `` `` Why , the height of a man , in nine cases out of ten , can be told from the length of his stride . It is a simple calculation enough , though there is no use my boring you with figures . I had this fellow 's stride both on the clay outside and on the dust within . Then I had a way of checking my calculation . When a man writes on a wall , his instinct leads him to write about the level of his own eyes . Now that writing was just over six feet from the ground . It was child 's play . `` `` And his age ? '' I asked . `` Well , if a man can stride four and a-half feet without the smallest effort , he ca n't be quite in the sere and yellow . That was the breadth of a puddle on the garden walk which he had evidently walked across . Patent-leather boots had gone round , and Square-toes had hopped over . There is no mystery about it at all . I am simply applying to ordinary life a few of those precepts of observation and deduction which I advocated in that article . Is there anything else that puzzles you ? `` `` The finger nails and the Trichinopoly , '' I suggested . `` The writing on the wall was done with a man 's forefinger dipped in blood . My glass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly scratched in doing it , which would not have been the case if the man 's nail had been trimmed . I gathered up some scattered ash from the floor . It was dark in colour and flakey -- -such an ash as is only made by a Trichinopoly . I have made a special study of cigar ashes -- -in fact , I have written a monograph upon the subject . I flatter myself that I can distinguish at a glance the ash of any known brand , either of cigar or of tobacco . It is just in such details that the skilled detective differs from the Gregson and Lestrade type . `` `` And the florid face ? '' I asked . `` Ah , that was a more daring shot , though I have no doubt that I was right . You must not ask me that at the present state of the affair . `` I passed my hand over my brow . `` My head is in a whirl , '' I remarked ; `` the more one thinks of it the more mysterious it grows . How came these two men -- -if there were two men -- -into an empty house ? What has become of the cabman who drove them ? How could one man compel another to take poison ? Where did the blood come from ? What was the object of the murderer , since robbery had no part in it ? How came the woman 's ring there ? Above all , why should the second man write up the German word RACHE before decamping ? I confess that I can not see any possible way of reconciling all these facts . `` My companion smiled approvingly . `` You sum up the difficulties of the situation succinctly and well , '' he said . `` There is much that is still obscure , though I have quite made up my mind on the main facts . As to poor Lestrade 's discovery it was simply a blind intended to put the police upon a wrong track , by suggesting Socialism and secret societies . It was not done by a German . The A , if you noticed , was printed somewhat after the German fashion . Now , a real German invariably prints in the Latin character , so that we may safely say that this was not written by one , but by a clumsy imitator who overdid his part . It was simply a ruse to divert inquiry into a wrong channel . I 'm not going to tell you much more of the case , Doctor . You know a conjuror gets no credit when once he has explained his trick , and if I show you too much of my method of working , you will come to the conclusion that I am a very ordinary individual after all . `` `` I shall never do that , '' I answered ; `` you have brought detection as near an exact science as it ever will be brought in this world . `` My companion flushed up with pleasure at my words , and the earnest way in which I uttered them . I had already observed that he was as sensitive to flattery on the score of his art as any girl could be of her beauty . `` I 'll tell you one other thing , '' he said . `` Patent leathers 10 and Square-toes came in the same cab , and they walked down the pathway together as friendly as possible -- -arm-in-arm , in all probability . When they got inside they walked up and down the room -- -or rather , Patent-leathers stood still while Square-toes walked up and down . I could read all that in the dust ; and I could read that as he walked he grew more and more excited . That is shown by the increased length of his strides . He was talking all the while , and working himself up , no doubt , into a fury . Then the tragedy occurred . I 've told you all I know myself now , for the rest is mere surmise and conjecture . We have a good working basis , however , on which to start . We must hurry up , for I want to go to Halle 's concert to hear Norman Neruda this afternoon . `` This conversation had occurred while our cab had been threading its way through a long succession of dingy streets and dreary by-ways . In the dingiest and dreariest of them our driver suddenly came to a stand . `` That 's Audley Court in there , '' he said , pointing to a narrow slit in the line of dead-coloured brick . `` You 'll find me here when you come back . `` Audley Court was not an attractive locality . The narrow passage led us into a quadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings . We picked our way among groups of dirty children , and through lines of discoloured linen , until we came to Number 46 , the door of which was decorated with a small slip of brass on which the name Rance was engraved . On enquiry we found that the constable was in bed , and we were shown into a little front parlour to await his coming.He appeared presently , looking a little irritable at being disturbed in his slumbers . `` I made my report at the office , '' he said.Holmes took a half-sovereign from his pocket and played with it pensively . `` We thought that we should like to hear it all from your own lips , '' he said . `` I shall be most happy to tell you anything I can , '' the constable answered with his eyes upon the little golden disk . `` Just let us hear it all in your own way as it occurred . `` Rance sat down on the horsehair sofa , and knitted his brows as though determined not to omit anything in his narrative . `` I 'll tell it ye from the beginning , '' he said . `` My time is from ten at night to six in the morning . At eleven there was a fight at the 'White Hart ' ; but bar that all was quiet enough on the beat . At one o'clock it began to rain , and I met Harry Murcher -- -him who has the Holland Grove beat -- -and we stood together at the corner of Henrietta Street a-talkin ' . Presently -- -maybe about two or a little after -- -I thought I would take a look round and see that all was right down the Brixton Road . It was precious dirty and lonely . Not a soul did I meet all the way down , though a cab or two went past me . I was a strollin ' down , thinkin ' between ourselves how uncommon handy a four of gin hot would be , when suddenly the glint of a light caught my eye in the window of that same house . Now , I knew that them two houses in Lauriston Gardens was empty on account of him that owns them who wo n't have the drains seen to , though the very last tenant what lived in one of them died o ' typhoid fever . I was knocked all in a heap therefore at seeing a light in the window , and I suspected as something was wrong . When I got to the door
