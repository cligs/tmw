`` `` I wish you not to speak of it or think of it again , '' said Kate . `` My mind is entirely made up when I say that I shall never marry any one -- -him least of all . `` `` You will think better of it , I am sure , '' her guardian said , patting her chestnut hair kindly as he stood over her . `` Since your poor father handed you over to me I have guarded you and cared for you to the best of my ability . Many a sleepless night I have spent thinking of your future and endeavouring to plan it out so as to secure your happiness . I should not be likely to give you bad advice now , or urge you to take a step which would make you unhappy . Have you anything to complain of in my treatment of you ? `` `` You have been always very just , '' Kate said with a sob . `` And this is how you repay me ! You are going to break my son 's heart , and through his mine . He is my only boy , and if anything went wrong with him I tell you that it would bring my grey hairs in sorrow to the grave . You have it in your power to do this , or , on the other hand , you may make my old age a happy one by the knowledge that the lad is mated with a good woman , and has attained the object on which his whole mind and heart are set . `` `` Oh , I ca n't , I ca n't . Do let the matter drop . `` `` Think it over , '' the old man said . `` Look at it from every point of view . Remember that the love of an honest man is not to be lightly spurned . I am naturally anxious about it , for my future happiness , as well as his , depends upon your decision . `` John Girdlestone was fairly satisfied with this interview . It seemed to him that his ward was rather less decided in her refusal at the end of it , and that his words had had some effect upon her , which might possibly increase with reflection . `` Give her a little time now , '' was his advice to his son . `` I think she will come round , but she needs managing . `` `` If I could get the money without taking her it would be better for me , '' Ezra said with an oath . `` And better for her too , '' remarked John Girdlestone grimly.One day Major Tobias Clutterbuck was sitting at the window of his little room smoking his cigarette and sipping his glass of wine , as was his custom if times were reasonably good . While thus agreeably employed he chanced to look across the road and perceived a little fringe of dark hair , and a still darker eye , which surveyed him round the border of one of the curtains which flanked a window opposite . The gallant major was much interested in this apparition , and rose to make a closer inspection of it , but , alas ! before he could focus it with his eye-glass it was gone ! He bent his gaze resolutely in that direction for a long time , and smoked at least half a dozen cigarettes , besides finishing the bottle of wine ; but although he thought he saw certain flittings and whiskings of garments in the dark background of the opposite room , he could not make out anything more definite.Next day the soldier was on the look-out at the same hour , and was rewarded by the appearance of two eyes , very mischievous and dangerous ones too , which were set in a buxom and by no means unprepossessing face . The lady who owned these charms looked very deliberately up the street , and very deliberately down the street , after which she bethought herself to look across the street , and started to perceive a stout , middle-aged gentleman , with a fiery face , who was looking at her with an expression of intense admiration . So much alarmed was she that she vanished behind the curtains and the major feared that he would see her no more . Fortunately , however , it became evident that the lady 's alarm was not very overpowering , for within five minutes she was back at the window , where her eyes again fell upon the beaming face and jaunty figure of the major , who had posed himself in a striking attitude , which was somewhat marred by the fact that he was still enveloped in his purple dressing-gown . This time her eyes lingered a little longer than before and the suspicion of a smile appeared upon her features . On this the major smiled and bowed , and she smiled also , showing a pretty little line of white teeth as she did so . What the veteran 's next move might have been no one can tell , for the lady solved the problem by disappearing , and this time permanently . He was very well satisfied , however , and chuckled much to himself while arraying himself in his long frock coat and immaculate collar before setting out for the club . He had been a sly old dog in his day , and had followed Venus almost as much as he had Mars during his chequered career.All day the recollection of this little episode haunted him . So much pre-occupied was he at the club that he actually played out the thirteenth trump upon his partner 's long suit and so sacrificed the game -- -being the first and only time that he was ever known to throw away a point . He told Von Baumser all about it when he came back . `` She 's a demned foine-looking woman , whoever she may be , '' he remarked , at they sat together before turning in . `` Be George ! she 's the foinest woman I 've seen for a long time . `` `` She 's a window , '' said the German . `` A what ? `` `` A window -- -the window of an engineer . `` `` Is it a widow you mane ? What d 'ye know about her ? What 's her name , and where does she come from ? `` `` I have heard from the slavey that a win -- -a widow lives over dere in those rooms . She boards mit Madame Morrison , and that window belongs to her privacy zimmer -- -dat is , chamber . As to her name , I have not heard it , or else I disremember it. '' '' Ged ! '' said the major , `` she 'd eyes that looked right through ye , and a figure like Juno . `` `` She 's vierzig if she 's a day -- -dat is , forty , '' Von Baumser remarked . `` Well , if she is , me boy , a woman of forty is just in the proime o ' loife . If you 'd seen her at the window , she would have taken ye by storm . She stands like this , and she looks up like this , and then down in this way . '' The major pursed up his warlike features into what he imagined to be an innocent and captivating expression . Then she looks across and sees me , and down go the lids of her eyes , like the shutting off of a bull's-eye lantern . Then she blushed and stole just one more glance at me round the corner of the curtain . She had two peeps , the divil a doubt of it . `` `` Dat is very good , '' the German said encouragingly . `` Ah , me boy , twinty years ago , when I was forty inches round the chest and thirty-three round the waist , I was worth looking at twice . Bedad , when a man gets ould and lonely he sees what a fool he was not to make better use of his time when he 'd the chance . `` `` Mein Gott ! '' cried Von Baumser . `` You do n't mean to say that you would marry suppose you had the chance ? `` `` I do n't know , '' the major answered reflectively . `` The vomens is not to be trusted , '' the German said sadly . `` I knew a voman in my own country which was the daughter of a man dat kept a hotel -- -and she and I was promised to be married to each others . Karl Hagelstein , he was to be vat you call my best man . A very handsome man was Karl , and I sent him often mit little presents of one thing or another to my girl , for there were reasons why I could not go myself . He was nicer than me because my hair was red , and pretty soon she began to like him , and he liked her too . So the day before the vedding she went down the Rhine to Frankfort by the boat , and he went down by train , and there they met and was married the one to the other . `` `` And what did you do ? '' the major asked with interest . `` Ah , dat was the most worst thing of all , for I followed them mit a friend of mine , and when we caught them I did not let her know , but I called him out of his hotel , and I told him that he must fight me . Dat vos a mistake . I should have done him an insult , and then he vould have had to ask me to fight , and I could have chosen my own veapon . As it was he chose swords , for he knew veil that I knew nothing of them , and he had been the best fencer in the whole of his University . Then we met in the morning , and before I had time to do anything he ran me through the left lung . I have shown you the mark of it . After dat I vas in bed for two month and more , and it still hurts me ven de veather is cold . That is vat they call satisfaction , '' Baumser added , pulling his long red beard reflectively . `` To me it has ever seemed the most dissatisfactory thing that could be imagined . `` `` I do n't wonder you 're afraid of the women after that , '' said the major , laughing . `` There are plenty of good women in the world , though , if you have the luck to come across them . D 'ye know a young fellow called Dimsdale -- - ? Ah , you would n't , but I 've met him lately at the club . He 's got a girl who 's the adopted daughter of that same ould Girdlestone that we talk about . I saw the two of them togither one day as happy as a pair of young love birds . Sure , you 've only got to look at her face to see that she 's as good as gold . I
