the building , which was constructed out of the remnants of a Norwegian barque stranded some years before . The thatch which covered it and the windows and door cut in the sides gave it a curiously hybrid appearance , and made it an object of interest to sightseers in those parts . Sampson was the owner of a fair-sized fishing-boat , which he worked with his eldest son , and which was said to yield him a decent livelihood . `` What are you going to do ? '' asked Girdlestone , as his son made his way to the door . `` Do n't look like a ghost , '' Ezra answered in an angry whisper . `` We 're all safe , if we are only cool . `` `` I am better now . You can trust me . `` `` Keep a smiling face , then , '' said Ezra , and knocked loudly at the door of the hut . The occupants had not heard their approach owing to the storm , but the instant that the young merchant struck the door there was a buzz of conversation and the sharp barking of a dog . Then came a dull thud and the barking ceased , from which Ezra concluded that some one had hurled a boot at the animal . `` We hai n't no bait , '' cried a gruff voice . `` Can I see Mr . Sampson ? '' asked Ezra . `` I tell 'ee we hai n't no bait , '' roared the voice in a more irritable tone . `` We do n't want bait . We want a word of talk , '' said Ezra.As he spoke , the door flew open , and a burly middle-aged man , in a red shirt , appeared , with a face which was almost the same colour as his garment . `` We hai n't got no -- - '' he was beginning , when he suddenly recognized his visitors and broke short off , staring at them with as much surprise as it is possible for human features to express . `` Well , if it ai n't the genelman from the Priory ! '' he exclaimed at last , with a whistle , which seemed to be his way of letting off the astonishment which would otherwise remain bottled up in his system . `` We want a minute 's talk with you , Mr. Sampson , '' said Ezra . `` Surely , sir -- -sure-ly ! '' the fisherman cried , bustling indoors and rubbing the top of two stools with his sleeve . `` Coom in ! 'Ere , Jarge , pull the seats up for the genelmen . `` At this summons , a lanky , big-boned hobbledehoy , in sea boots , pushed the stools up towards the fire , on which a log of wood was blazing cheerily . The two Girdlestones sat warming themselves , while the fisherman and his son surveyed them silently with open eyes and mouth , as though they were a pair of strange zoological curiosities cast up by the gale . `` Keep doon , Sammy ! '' the fisherman said hoarsely to a great collie dog who was licking at Girdlestone 's hands . `` What be he a suckin ' at ? Why , sure , sir , there be blood on your hands . `` `` My father scratched himself , '' said Ezra promptly . `` His hat has blown away too , and we lost our way in the dark , so we 're rather in a mess . `` `` Why , so you be ! '' Sampson cried , eyeing them up and down . `` I thought , when I heard you , as it was they folk from Claxton as comes 'ere for bait whenever they be short . That 's nigh about the only visitors we ever gets here ; bea n't it , Jarge ? `` George , thus appealed to , made no articulate reply , but he opened his great mouth and laughed vociferously . `` We 've come for something which will pay you better than that , '' said Ezra . `` You remember my meeting you two or three Saturdays ago , and speaking to you about your house and your boat and one thing or another ? `` The fisherman nodded . `` You said something then about your boat being a good sea-going craft , and that it was as roomy as many a yacht . I think I told you that I might give it a try some day . `` The fisherman nodded again . His wondering eyes were still surveying his visitors , dwelling on every rent in their clothes or stain on their persons . `` My father and I want to get down the coast as far as the Downs . Now we thought that we might just as well give your boat a turn and have your son and yourself to work it . I suppose she is fit to go that distance ? '' '' Fit ! whoy she be fit to go to 'Meriky ! The Downs ai n't more'n hunder and twenty mile . With a good breeze she would do it in a day . By to-morrow afternoon we 'd be ready to make a start if the wind slackens . `` `` To-morrow afternoon ! We must be there by that time . We want you to start to-night . `` The seaman looked round at his son , and the boy burst out laughing once again . `` It 'ud be a rum start for a vyage at this time o ' night , with half a gale from the sou'-west . I never heard tell o ' sich a thing ! `` `` Look here , '' said Ezra , bending forward and emphasizing his words with his uplifted hand , `` we 've set our minds on going , and we do n't mind paying for the fancy . The sooner we start the better pleased we shall be . Name your price . If you wo n't take us , there are many in Claxton that will . `` `` Well , it be a cruel bad night to be sure , '' the fisherman answered . `` Like as not we 'd get the boat knocked about , an ' maybe have her riggin ' damaged . We 've been a-fresh paintin ' of her too , and that would be spoiled . It 's a powerful long way , and then there 's the gettin ' back . It means the loss of two or three days ' work , and there 's plenty of fish on the coast now , and a good market for them . `` `` Would thirty pounds pay you ? '' asked Ezra.The sum was considerably more than the fisherman would have ventured to ask . The very magnificence of it , however , encouraged him to hope that more might be forthcoming . `` Five-and-thirty would n't pay me for the loss and trouble , '' he said ; `` forbye the damage to the boat . `` `` Say forty , then , '' said Ezra . `` It 's rather much to pay for a freak of this sort , but we wo n't haggle over a pound or two . `` The old seaman scratched his head as though uncertain whether to take this blessing which the gods had sent or to hold out for more.Ezra solved the matter by springing to his feet . `` Come on to Claxton , father , '' he cried . `` We 'll get what we want there . `` `` Steady , sir , steady ! '' the fisherman said hastily . `` I did n't say as I was n't good for the job . I 'm ready to start for the sum you names . Hurry up , Jarge , and get the tackle ready . `` The sea-booted youth began to bustle about at this summons , bearing things out into the darkness and running back for more with an alacrity which one would hardly have suspected from his uncouth appearance . `` Can I wash my hands ? '' asked Girdlestone . There were several crimson stains where he had held the body of the murdered girl . It appeared that Burt 's bludgeon was not such a bloodless weapon after all . `` There 's water , sir , in that bucket . Maybe you would like a bit o ' plaster to bind up the cut ? `` `` It 's not bad enough for that , '' said the merchant hastily . `` I 'll leave you here , '' the fisherman remarked . `` There 's much to be done down theer . You 'll have poor feedin ' I 'm afraid ; biscuits and water and bully beef . `` `` Never mind that . Hurry up all you can . '' The man tramped away down to the beach , and Ezra remained with his father in the hut . The old man washed his hands very carefully , and poured the stained water away outside the door . `` How are you going to pay this man ? '' he asked . `` I have some money sewed up in my waistcoat , '' Ezra answered . `` I was n't such a fool as not to know that a crash might come at any moment . I was determined that all should not go to the creditors . `` `` How much have you ? `` `` What 's that to you ? '' Ezra asked angrily . `` You mind your own affairs . The money 's mine , since I have saved it . It 's quite enough if I spend part of it in helping you away . `` `` I do n't dispute it , my boy , '' the old merchant said meekly . `` It 's a blessing that you had the foresight to secure it . Are you thinking of making for France now ? '' '' France ! Pshaw , man , the telegraph would have set every gendarme on the coast on the look-out . No , no , that would be a poor hope of safety ! `` `` Where then ? `` `` Where is the fisherman ? '' asked Ezra suspiciously , peering out from the door into the darkness . `` No one must know our destination . We 'll pick up Migg 's ship , theBlack Eagle , in the Downs . She was to have gone down the Thames to-day , and to lie at Gravesend , and then to work round to the Downs , where she will be to-morrow . It will be a Sunday , so no news can get about . If we get away with him they will lose all trace of us . We 'll get him to land up upon the Spanish coast . I think it will fairly puzzle the police . No doubt they are watching every station on the line by this time . I wonder what has become of Burt ? `` `` I trust that they will hang him , '' John Girdlestone cried , with a gleam of his old energy . `` If he had taken the ordinary precaution of making sure who the girl was , this would never have occurred . `` `` Do n't throw the blame on him , '' said Ezra bitterly . `` Who was it who kept us all up to it whenever
