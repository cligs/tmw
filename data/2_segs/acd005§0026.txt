`` I am certain of it . '' In a few broken sentences he shot out all that he had seen and heard . She listened with a grim face , and hands which closed ever tighter and tighter as he proceeded . But he had said the truth about the Mortemarts . They came of a contentious blood , and were ever at their best at a moment of action . Hate rather than dismay filled her heart as she listened , and the whole energy of her nature gathered and quickened to meet the crisis . `` I shall go and see him , '' she cried , sweeping towards the door . `` No , no , Francoise . Believe me , you will ruin everything if you do.Strict orders have been given to the guard to admit no one to the king . `` `` But I shall insist upon passing them . `` `` Believe me , sister , it is worse than useless . I have spoken with the officer of the guard , and the command is a stringent one . `` `` Ah , I shall manage . `` `` No , you shall not . '' He put his back against the door . `` I know that it is useless , and I will not have my sister make herself the laughing-stock of the court , trying to force her way into the room of a man who repulses her . `` His sister 's cheeks flushed at the words , and she paused irresolute . `` Had I only a day , Charles , I am sure that I could bring him back to me . There has been some other influence here , that meddlesome Jesuit or the pompous Bossuet , perhaps . Only one day to counteract their wiles ! Can I not see them waving hell-fire before his foolish eyes , as one swings a torch before a bull to turn it ? Oh , if I could but baulk them to-night ! That woman ! that cursed woman ! The foul viper which I nursed in my bosom ! Oh , I had rather see Louis in his grave than married to her ! Charles , Charles , it must be stopped ; I say it must be stopped ! I will give anything , everything , to prevent it ! `` `` What will you give , my sister ? `` She looked at him aghast . `` What ! you do not wish me to buy you ? '' she said . `` No ; but I wish to buy others. '' '' Ha ! You see a chance , then ? `` `` One , and one only . But time presses . I want money . `` `` How much ? `` `` I can not have too much . All that you can spare . `` With hands which trembled with eagerness she unlocked a secret cupboard in the wall in which she concealed her valuables . A blaze of jewellery met her brother 's eyes as he peered over her shoulder . Great rubies , costly emeralds , deep ruddy beryls , glimmering diamonds , were scattered there in one brilliant shimmering many-coloured heap , the harvest which she had reaped from the king 's generosity during more than fifteen years . At one side were three drawers , the one over the other . She drew out the lowest one . It was full to the brim of glitteringlouis d'ors . `` Take what you will ! '' she said . `` And now your plan ! Quick ! `` He stuffed the money in handfuls into the side pockets of his coat . Coins slipped between his fingers and tinkled and wheeled over the floor , but neither cast a glance at them . `` Your plan ? '' she repeated . `` We must prevent the Archbishop from arriving here . Then the marriage would be postponed until to-morrow night , and you would have time to act . `` `` But how prevent it ? `` `` There are a dozen good rapiers about the court which are to be boughtfor less than I carry in one pocket . There is De la Touche , youngTurberville , old Major Despard , Raymond de Carnac , and the four Latours.I will gather them together , and wait on the road . `` `` And waylay the archbishop ? `` `` No ; the messengers . `` `` Oh , excellent ! You are a prince of brothers ! If no message reachesParis , we are saved . Go ; go ; do not lose a moment , my dear Charles . `` `` It is very well , Francoise ; but what are we to do with them when we get them ? We may lose our heads over the matter , it seems to me . After all , they are the king 's messengers , and we can scarce pass our swords through them. '' '' No ? `` `` There would be no forgiveness for that . `` `` But consider that before the matter is looked into I shall have regained my influence with the king . `` `` All very fine , my little sister , but how long is your influence to last ? A pleasant life for us if at every change of favour we have to fly the country ! No , no , Francoise ; the most that we can do is to detain the messengers . `` `` Where can you detain them ? `` `` I have an idea . There is the castle of the Marquis de Montespan atPortillac . `` `` Of my husband ! '' '' Precisely . `` `` Of my most bitter enemy ! Oh , Charles , you are not serious . `` `` On the contrary , I was never more so . The marquis was away in Paris yesterday , and has not yet returned . Where is the ring with his arms ? `` She hunted among her jewels and picked out a gold ring with a broad engraved face . `` This will be our key . When good Marceau , the steward , sees it , every dungeon in the castle will be at our disposal . It is that or nothing . There is no other place where we can hold them safe . `` `` But when my husband returns ? `` `` Ah , he may be a little puzzled as to his captives . And the complaisant Marceau may have an evil quarter of an hour . But that may not be for a week , and by that time , my little sister , I have confidence enough in you to think that you really may have finished the campaign . Not another word , for every moment is of value . Adieu , Francoise ! We shall not be conquered without a struggle . I will send a message to you to-night to let you know how fortune uses us . '' He took her fondly in his arms , kissed her , and then hurried from the room.For hours after his departure she paced up and down with noiseless steps upon the deep soft carpet , her hand still clenched , her eyes flaming , her whole soul wrapped and consumed with jealousy and hatred of her rival . Ten struck , and eleven , and midnight , but still she waited , fierce and eager , straining her ears for every foot-fall which might be the herald of news . At last it came . She heard the quick step in the passage , the tap at the ante-room door , and the whispering of her black page . Quivering with impatience , she rushed in and took the note herself from the dusty cavalier who had brought it . It was but six words scrawled roughly upon a wisp of dirty paper , but it brought the colour back to her cheeks and the smile to her lips . It was her brother 's writing , and it ran : `` The archbishop will not come to-night . `` De Catinat in the meanwhile was perfectly aware of the importance of the mission which had been assigned to him . The secrecy which had been enjoined by the king , his evident excitement , and the nature of his orders , all confirmed the rumours which were already beginning to buzz round the court . He knew enough of the intrigues and antagonisms with which the court was full to understand that every precaution was necessary in carrying out his instructions . He waited , therefore , until night had fallen before ordering his soldier-servant to bring round the two horses to one of the less public gates of the grounds . As he and his friend walked together to the spot , he gave the young American a rapid sketch of the situation at the court , and of the chance that this nocturnal ride might be an event which would affect the future history of France . `` I like your king , '' said Amos Green , `` and I am glad to ride in his service . He is a slip of a man to be the head of a great nation , but he has the eye of a chief . If one met him alone in a Maine forest , one would know him as a man who was different to his fellows . Well , I am glad that he is going to marry again , though it 's a great house for any woman to have to look after . `` De Catinat smiled at his comrade 's idea of a queen 's duties . `` Are you armed ? '' he asked . `` You have no sword or pistols ? `` `` No ; if I may not carry my gun , I had rather not be troubled by tools that I have never learned to use . I have my knife . But why do you ask ? `` `` Because there may be danger . `` `` And how ? `` `` Many have an interest in stopping this marriage . All the first men of the kingdom are bitterly against it . If they could stopus* , they would stopit* , for to-night at least . `` `` But I thought it was a secret ? `` `` There is no such thing at a court . There is the dauphin , or the king 's brother , either of them , or any of their friends , would be right glad that we should be in the Seine before we reach the archbishop 's house this night . But who is this ? `` A burly figure had loomed up through the gloom on the path upon which they were going . As it approached , a coloured lamp dangling from one of the trees shone upon the blue and silver of an officer of the guards . It was Major de Brissac , of De Catinat 's own regiment. '' Hullo ! Whither away ? '' he asked . `` To Paris , major . `` `` I go there myself within an hour . Will you not wait , that we may go together ? `` `` I am sorry , but I ride on a matter of urgency . I must not lose a minute . `` `` Very good . Good-night , and a pleasant ride . `` `` Is he a trusty man , our friend the major ? '' asked Amos Green , glancing back
