lord 's side.As they passed through the castle gate , John plucked at Aylward 's sleeve , and the two fell behind . `` I must crave your pardon , comrade , '' said he , bluntly . `` I was a fool not to know that a little rooster may be the gamest . I believe that this man is indeed a leader whom we may follow . `` Black was the mouth of Twynham Castle , though a pair of torches burning at the further end of the gateway cast a red glare over the outer bailey , and sent a dim , ruddy flicker through the rough-hewn arch , rising and falling with fitful brightness . Over the door the travellers could discern the escutcheon of the Montacutes , a roebuck gules on a field argent , flanked on either side by smaller shields which bore the red roses of the veteran constable . As they passed over the drawbridge , Alleyne marked the gleam of arms in the embrasures to right and left , and they had scarce set foot upon the causeway ere a hoarse blare burst from a bugle , and , with screech of hinge and clank of chain , the ponderous bridge swung up into the air , drawn by unseen hands . At the same instant the huge portcullis came rattling down from above , and shut off the last fading light of day . Sir Nigel and his lady walked on in deep talk , while a fat under-steward took charge of the three comrades , and led them to the buttery , where beef , bread , and beer were kept ever in readiness for the wayfarer . After a hearty meal and a dip in the trough to wash the dust from them , they strolled forth into the bailey , where the bowman peered about through the darkness at wall and at keep , with the carping eyes of one who has seen something of sieges , and is not likely to be satisfied . To Alleyne and to John , however , it appeared to be as great and as stout a fortress as could be built by the hands of man.Erected by Sir Balwin de Redvers in the old fighting days of the twelfth century , when men thought much of war and little of comfort , Castle Twynham had been designed as a stronghold pure and simple , unlike those later and more magnificent structures where warlike strength had been combined with the magnificence of a palace . From the time of the Edwards such buildings as Conway or Caernarvon castles , to say nothing of Royal Windsor , had shown that it was possible to secure luxury in peace as well as security in times of trouble . Sir Nigel 's trust , however , still frowned above the smooth-flowing waters of the Avon , very much as the stern race of early Anglo-Normans had designed it . There were the broad outer and inner bailies , not paved , but sown with grass to nourish the sheep and cattle which might be driven in on sign of danger . All round were high and turreted walls , with at the corner a bare square-faced keep , gaunt and windowless , rearing up from a lofty mound , which made it almost inaccessible to an assailant . Against the bailey-walls were rows of frail wooden houses and leaning sheds , which gave shelter to the archers and men-at-arms who formed the garrison . The doors of these humble dwellings were mostly open , and against the yellow glare from within Alleyne could see the bearded fellows cleaning their harness , while their wives would come out for a gossip , with their needlework in their hands , and their long black shadows streaming across the yard . The air was full of the clack of their voices and the merry prattling of children , in strange contrast to the flash of arms and constant warlike challenge from the walls above . `` Methinks a company of school lads could hold this place against an army , '' quoth John . `` And so say I , '' said Alleyne . `` Nay , there you are wide of the clout , '' the bowman said gravely . `` By my hilt ! I have seen a stronger fortalice carried in a summer evening . I remember such a one in Picardy , with a name as long as a Gascon 's pedigree . It was when I served under Sir Robert Knolles , before the days of the Company ; and we came by good plunder at the sacking of it . I had myself a great silver bowl , with two goblets , and a plastron of Spanish steel . Pasques Dieu ! there are some fine women over yonder ! Mort de ma vie ! see to that one in the doorway ! I will go speak to her . But whom have we here ? `` `` Is there an archer here hight Sam Aylward ? '' asked a gaunt man-at-arms , clanking up to them across the courtyard . `` My name , friend , '' quoth the bowman . `` Then sure I have no need to tell thee mine , '' said the other . `` By the rood ! if it is not Black Simon of Norwich ! '' cried Aylward . `` A mon coeur , camarade , a mon coeur ! Ah , but I am blithe to see thee ! '' The two fell upon each other and hugged like bears . `` And where from , old blood and bones ? '' asked the bowman . `` I am in service here . Tell me , comrade , is it sooth that we shall have another fling at these Frenchmen ? It is so rumored in the guard-room , and that Sir Nigel will take the field once more . `` `` It is like enough , mon gar. , as things go . `` `` Now may the Lord be praised ! '' cried the other . `` This very night will I set apart a golden ouche to be offered on the shrine of my name-saint . I have pined for this , Aylward , as a young maid pines for her lover . `` `` Art so set on plunder then ? Is the purse so light that there is not enough for a rouse ? I have a bag at my belt , camarade , and you have but to put your fist into it for what you want . It was ever share and share between us . `` `` Nay , friend , it is not the Frenchman 's gold , but the Frenchman 's blood that I would have . I should not rest quiet in the grave , coz , if I had not another turn at them . For with us in France it has ever been fair and honest war -- -a shut fist for the man , but a bended knee for the woman . But how was it at Winchelsea when their galleys came down upon it some few years back ? I had an old mother there , lad , who had come down thither from the Midlands to be the nearer her son . They found her afterwards by her own hearthstone , thrust through by a Frenchman 's bill . My second sister , my brother 's wife , and her two children , they were but ash-heaps in the smoking ruins of their house . I will not say that we have not wrought great scath upon France , but women and children have been safe from us . And so , old friend , my heart is hot within me , and I long to hear the old battle-cry again , and , by God 's truth ! if Sir Nigel unfurls his pennon , here is one who will be right glad to feel the saddle-flaps under his knees . `` `` We have seen good work together , old war-dog , '' quoth Aylward ; `` and , by my hilt ! we may hope to see more ere we die . But we are more like to hawk at the Spanish woodcock than at the French heron , though certes it is rumored that Du Guesclin with all the best lances of France have taken service under the lions and towers of Castile . But , comrade , it is in my mind that there is some small matter of dispute still open between us . `` `` 'Fore God , it is sooth ! '' cried the other ; `` I had forgot it . The provost-marshal and his men tore us apart when last we met . `` `` On which , friend , we vowed that we should settle the point when next we came together . Hast thy sword , I see , and the moon throws glimmer enough for such old night-birds as we . On guard , mon gar. ! I have not heard clink of steel this month or more . `` `` Out from the shadow then , '' said the other , drawing his sword . `` A vow is a vow , and not lightly to be broken . `` `` A vow to the saints , '' cried Alleyne , `` is indeed not to be set aside ; but this is a devil 's vow , and , simple clerk as I am , I am yet the mouthpiece of the true church when I say that it were mortal sin to fight on such a quarrel . What ! shall two grown men carry malice for years , and fly like snarling curs at each other 's throats ? `` `` No malice , my young clerk , no malice , '' quoth Black Simon . `` I have not a bitter drop in my heart for mine old comrade ; but the quarrel , as he hath told you , is still open and unsettled . Fall on , Aylward ! `` `` Not whilst I can stand between you , '' cried Alleyne , springing before the bowman . `` It is shame and sin to see two Christian Englishmen turn swords against each other like the frenzied bloodthirsty paynim . `` `` And , what is more , '' said Hordle John , suddenly appearing out of the buttery with the huge board upon which the pastry was rolled , `` if either raise sword I shall flatten him like a Shrovetide pancake . By the black rood ! I shall drive him into the earth , like a nail into a door , rather than see you do scath to each other . `` `` 'Fore God , this is a strange way of preaching peace , '' cried Black Simon . `` You may find the scath yourself , my lusty friend , if you raise your great cudgel to me . I had as lief have the castle drawbridge drop upon my pate . `` `` Tell me , Aylward , '' said Alleyne earnestly , with his hands outstretched to keep the pair asunder , `` what is the cause of quarrel , that we may see whether honorable settlement may not be arrived at ? `` The bowman looked down at his feet and then up at the moon , `` Parbleu ! '' he cried , `` the cause of quarrel ? Why , mon petit , it was years ago in Limousin , and how can I bear in mind what was the cause of it ? Simon there
