the past known many of Nature 's secrets which are lost to us . I can not say , however , from my own knowledge that the modern theosophists really possess the powers that they claim . `` `` Are they a vindictive class of people ? '' I asked . `` Is there any offence among them which can only be expiated by death ? `` `` Not that I know of , '' my father answered , raising his white eyebrows in surprise . `` You appear to be in an inquisitive humour this afternoon -- -what is the object of all these questions ? Have our Eastern neighbours aroused your curiosity or suspicion in any way ? `` I parried the question as best I might , for I was unwilling to let the old man know what was in my mind . No good purpose could come from his enlightenment ; his age and his health demanded rest rather than anxiety ; and indeed , with the best will in the world I should have found it difficult to explain to another what was so very obscure to myself . For every reason I felt that it was best that he should be kept in the dark.Never in all my experience had I known a day pass so slowly as did that eventful 5th of October . In every possible manner I endeavoured to while away the tedious hours , and yet it seemed as if darkness would never arrive.I tried to read , I tried to write , I paced about the lawn , I walked to the end of the lane , I put new flies upon my fishing-hooks , I began to index my father 's library -- -in a dozen ways I endeavoured to relieve the suspense which was becoming intolerable . My sister , I could see , was suffering from the same feverish restlessness.Again and again our good father remonstrated with us in his mild way for our erratic behaviour and the continual interruption of his work which arose from it.At last , however , the tea was brought , and the tea was taken , the curtains were drawn , the lamps lit , and after another interminable interval the prayers were read and the servants dismissed to their rooms . My father compounded and swallowed his nightly jorum of toddy , and then shuffled off to his room , leaving the two of us in the parlour with our nerves in a tingle and our minds full of the most vague and yet terrible apprehensions.It was a quarter past ten o'clock by the parlour timepiece when my father went off to his room , and left Esther and myself together . We heard his slow steps dying away up the creaking staircase , until the distant slamming of a door announced that he had reached his sanctum.The simple oil lamp upon the table threw a weird , uncertain light over the old room , flickering upon the carved oak panelling , and casting strange , fantastic shadows from the high-elbowed , straight-backed furniture . My sister 's white , anxious face stood out in the obscurity with a startling exactness of profile like one of Rembrandt 's portraits.We sat opposite to each other on either side of the table with no sound breaking the silence save the measured ticking of the clock and the intermittent chirping of a cricket beneath the grate.There was something awe-inspiring in the absolute stillness . The whistling of a belated peasant upon the high road was a relief to us , and we strained our ears to catch the last of his notes as he plodded steadily homewards.At first we had made some pretence -- -she of knitting and I of reading -- -but we soon abandoned the useless deception , and sat uneasily waiting , starting and glancing at each other with questioning eyes whenever the faggot crackled in the fire or a rat scampered behind the wainscot . There was a heavy electrical feeling in the air , which weighed us down with a foreboding of disaster.I rose and flung the hall door open to admit the fresh breeze of the night . Ragged clouds swept across the sky , and the moon peeped out at times between their hurrying fringes , bathing the whole countryside in its cold , white radiance . From where I stood in the doorway I could see the edge of the Cloomber wood , though the house itself was only visible from the rising ground some little distance off . At my sister 's suggestion we walked together , she with her shawl over her head , as far as the summit of this elevation , and looked out in the direction of the Hall.There was no illumination of the windows tonight . From roof to basement not a light twinkled in any part of the great building . Its huge mass loomed up dark and sullen amid the trees which surrounded it , looking more like some giant sarcophagus than a human habitation.To our overwrought nerves there was something of terror in its mere bulk and its silence . We stood for some little time peering at it through the darkness , and then we made our way back to the parlour again , where we sat waiting -- -waiting , we knew not for what , and yet with absolute conviction that some terrible experience was in store for us.It was twelve o'clock or thereabout when my sister suddenly sprang to her feet and held up her fingers to bespeak attention . `` Do you hear nothing ? '' she asked.I strained my ears , but without success . `` Come to the door , '' she cried , with a trembling voice . `` Now can you hear anything ? `` In the deep silence of the night I distinctly heard a dull , murmuring , clattering sound , continuous apparently , but very faint and low . `` What is it ? '' I asked , in a subdued voice . `` It 's the sound of a man running towards us , '' she answered , and then , suddenly dropping the last semblance of self-command , she fell upon her knees beside the table and began praying aloud with that frenzied earnestness which intense , overpowering fear can produce , breaking off now and again into half-hysterical whimperings.I could distinguish the sound clearly enough now to know that her quick , feminine perception had not deceived her , and that it was indeed caused by a running man.On he came , and on down the high road , his footfalls ringing out clearer and sharper every moment . An urgent messenger he must be , for he neither paused nor slackened his pace.The quick , crisp rattle was changed suddenly to a dull , muffled murmur . He had reached the point where sand had been recently laid down for a hundred yards or so . In a few moments , however , he was back on hard ground again and his flying feet came nearer and ever nearer.He must , I reflected , be abreast of the head of the lane now . Would he hold on ? Or would he turn down to Branksome ? The thought had hardly crossed my mind when I heard by the difference of the sound that the runner had turned the corner , and that his goal was beyond all question the laird 's house.Rushing down to the gate of the lawn , I reached it just as our visitor dashed it open and fell into my arms . I could see in the moonlight that it was none other than Mordaunt Heatherstone . `` What has happened ? '' I cried . `` What is amiss , Mordaunt ? `` `` My father ! '' he gasped -- - '' my father ! `` His hat was gone , his eyes dilated with terror , and his face as bloodless as that of a corpse . I could feel that the hands which clasped my arms were quivering and shaking with emotion . `` You are exhausted , '' I said , leading him into the parlour . `` Give yourself a moment 's rest before you speak to us . Be calm , man , you are with your best friends . `` I laid him on the old horsehair sofa , while Esther , whose fears had all flown to the winds now that something practical was to be done , dashed some brandy into a tumbler and brought it to him . The stimulant had a marvellous effect upon him , for the colour began to come back into his pale cheeks and the light of recognition in his eyes.He sat up and took Esther 's hand in both of his , like a man who is waking out of some bad dream and wishes to assure himself that he is really in safety . `` Your father ? '' I asked . `` What of him ? `` `` He is gone. '' '' Gone ! `` `` Yes ; he is gone ; and so is Corporal Rufus Smith . We shall never set eyes upon them again . `` `` But where have they gone ? '' I cried . `` This is unworthy of you , Mordaunt . What right have we to sit here , allowing our private feelings to overcome us , while there is a possibility of succouring your father ? Up , man ! Let us follow him . Tell me only what direction he took . `` `` It 's no use , '' young Heatherstone answered , burying his face in his hands . `` Do n't reproach me , West , for you do n't know all the circumstances . What can we do to reverse the tremendous and unknown laws which are acting against us ? The blow has long been hanging over us , and now it has fallen . God help us ! `` `` In Heaven 's name tell me what has happened ? '' said I excitedly . `` We must not yield to despair . `` `` We can do nothing until daybreak , '' he answered . `` We shall then endeavour to obtain some trace of them . It is hopeless at present . `` `` And how about Gabriel and Mrs . Heatherstone ? '' I asked . `` Can we not bring them down from the Hall at once ? Your poor sister must be distracted with terror . `` `` She knows nothing of it , '' Mordaunt answered . `` She sleeps at the other side of the house , and has not heard or seen anything . As to my poor mother , she has expected some such event for so long a time that it has not come upon her as a surprise . She is , of course , overwhelmed with grief , but would , I think , prefer to be left to herself for the present . Her firmness and composure should be a lesson to me , but I am constitutionally excitable , and this catastrophe coming after our long period of suspense deprived me of my very reason for a time . `` `` If we can do nothing until the morning , '' I said , `` you have time to tell us all that has occurred . `` `` I will do so , '' he answered , rising and holding his shaking hands to the fire . `` You know already that we have had reason for some time -- -for many years in fact -- -to fear that a terrible retribution was hanging
