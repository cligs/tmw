tore the front of his helmet out , while the German , aiming somewhat low , and half stunned by the shock , had the misfortune to strike his adversary upon the thigh , a breach of the rules of the tilting-yard , by which he not only sacrificed his chances of success , but would also have forfeited his horse and his armor , had the English knight chosen to claim them . A roar of applause from the English soldiers , with an ominous silence from the vast crowd who pressed round the barriers , announced that the balance of victory lay with the holders . Already the ten champions had assembled in front of the prince to receive his award , when a harsh bugle call from the further end of the lists drew all eyes to a new and unexpected arrival.The Bordeaux lists were , as has already been explained , situated upon the plain near the river upon those great occasions when the tilting-ground in front of the Abbey of St. Andrew 's was deemed to be too small to contain the crowd . On the eastern side of this plain the country-side sloped upwards , thick with vines in summer , but now ridged with the brown bare enclosures . Over the gently rising plain curved the white road which leads inland , usually flecked with travellers , but now with scarce a living form upon it , so completely had the lists drained all the district of its inhabitants . Strange it was to see such a vast concourse of people , and then to look upon that broad , white , empty highway which wound away , bleak and deserted , until it narrowed itself to a bare streak against the distant uplands.Shortly after the contest had begun , any one looking from the lists along this road might have remarked , far away in the extreme distance , two brilliant and sparkling points which glittered and twinkled in the bright shimmer of the winter sun . Within an hour these had become clearer and nearer , until they might be seen to come from the reflection from the head-pieces of two horsemen who were riding at the top of their speed in the direction of Bordeaux . Another half-hour had brought them so close that every point of their bearing and equipment could be discerned . The first was a knight in full armor , mounted upon a brown horse with a white blaze upon breast and forehead . He was a short man of great breadth of shoulder , with vizor closed , and no blazonry upon his simple white surcoat or plain black shield . The other , who was evidently his squire and attendant , was unarmed save for the helmet upon his head , but bore in his right hand a very long and heavy oaken spear which belonged to his master . In his left hand the squire held not only the reins of his own horse but those of a great black war-horse , fully harnessed , which trotted along at his side . Thus the three horses and their two riders rode swiftly to the lists , and it was the blare of the trumpet sounded by the squire as his lord rode into the arena which had broken in upon the prize-giving and drawn away the attention and interest of the spectators . `` Ha , John ! '' cried the prince , craning his neck , `` who is this cavalier , and what is it that he desires ? `` `` On my word , sire , '' replied Chandos , with the utmost surprise upon his face , `` it is my opinion that he is a Frenchman . `` `` A Frenchman ! '' repeated Don Pedro . `` And how can you tell that , my Lord Chandos , when he has neither coat-armor , crest , or blazonry ? `` `` By his armor , sire , which is rounder at elbow and at shoulder than any of Bordeaux or of England . Italian he might be were his bassinet more sloped , but I will swear that those plates were welded betwixt this and Rhine . Here comes his squire , however , and we shall hear what strange fortune hath brought him over the marches . `` As he spoke the attendant cantered up the grassy enclosure , and pulling up his steed in front of the royal stand , blew a second fanfare upon his bugle . He was a raw-boned , swarthy-cheeked man , with black bristling beard and a swaggering bearing.Having sounded his call , he thrust the bugle into his belt , and , pushing his way betwixt the groups of English and of Gascon knights , he reined up within a spear 's length of the royal party . `` I come , '' he shouted in a hoarse , thick voice , with a strong Breton accent , `` as squire and herald from my master , who is a very valiant pursuivant-of-arms , and a liegeman to the great and powerful monarch , Charles , king of the French . My master has heard that there is jousting here , and prospect of honorable advancement , so he has come to ask that some English cavalier will vouchsafe for the love of his lady to run a course with sharpened lances with him , or to meet him with sword , mace , battle-axe , or dagger . He bade me say , however , that he would fight only with a true Englishman , and not with any mongrel who is neither English nor French , but speaks with the tongue of the one , and fights under the banner of the other. '' '' Sir ! '' cried De Clisson , with a voice of thunder , while his countrymen clapped their hands to their swords . The squire , however , took no notice of their angry faces , but continued with his master 's message . `` He is now ready , sire , '' he said , `` albeit his destrier has travelled many miles this day , and fast , for we were in fear lest we come too late for the jousting . `` `` Ye have indeed come too late , '' said the prince , `` seeing that the prize is about to be awarded ; yet I doubt not that one of these gentlemen will run a course for the sake of honor with this cavalier of France . `` `` And as to the prize , sire , '' quoth Sir Nigel , `` I am sure that I speak for all when I say this French knight hath our leave to bear it away with him if he can fairly win it . `` `` Bear word of this to your master , '' said the prince , `` and ask him which of these five Englishmen he would desire to meet . But stay ; your master bears no coat-armor , and we have not yet heard his name . `` `` My master , sire , is under vow to the Virgin neither to reveal his name nor to open his vizor until he is back upon French ground once more . `` `` Yet what assurance have we , '' said the prince , `` that this is not some varlet masquerading in his master 's harness , or some caitiff knight , the very touch of whose lance might bring infamy upon an honorable gentleman ? `` `` It is not so , sire , '' cried the squire earnestly . `` There is no man upon earth who would demean himself by breaking a lance with my master . `` `` You speak out boldly , squire , '' the prince answered ; `` but unless I have some further assurance of your master 's noble birth and gentle name I can not match the choicest lances of my court against him . `` `` You refuse , sire ? `` `` I do refuse . `` `` Then , sire , I was bidden to ask you from my master whether you would consent if Sir John Chandos , upon hearing my master 's name , should assure you that he was indeed a man with whom you might yourself cross swords without indignity . `` `` I ask no better , '' said the prince . `` Then I must ask , Lord Chandos , that you will step forth . I have your pledge that the name shall remain ever a secret , and that you will neither say nor write one word which might betray it . The name is -- -- -- '' He stooped down from his horse and whispered something into the old knight 's ear which made him start with surprise , and stare with much curiosity at the distant Knight , who was sitting his charger at the further end of the arena . `` Is this indeed sooth ? '' he exclaimed . `` It is , my lord , and I swear it by St. Ives of Brittany . `` `` I might have known it , '' said Chandos , twisting his moustache , and still looking thoughtfully at the cavalier . `` What then , Sir John ? '' asked the prince . `` Sire , this is a knight whom it is indeed great honor to meet , and I would that your grace would grant me leave to send my squire for my harness , for I would dearly love to run a course with him . `` `` Nay , nay , Sir John , you have gained as much honor as one man can bear , and it were hard if you could not rest now . But I pray you , squire , to tell your master that he is very welcome to our court , and that wines and spices will be served him , if he would refresh himself before jousting . `` `` My master will not drink , '' said the squire . `` Let him then name the gentleman with whom he would break a spear . `` `` He would contend with these five knights , each to choose such weapons as suit him best . `` `` I perceive , '' said the prince , `` that your master is a man of great heart and high of enterprise . But the sun already is low in the west , and there will scarce be light for these courses . I pray you , gentlemen , to take your places , that we may see whether this stranger 's deeds are as bold as his words . `` The unknown knight had sat like a statue of steel , looking neither to the right nor to the left during these preliminaries . He had changed from the horse upon which he had ridden , and bestrode the black charger which his squire had led beside him . His immense breadth , his stern composed appearance , and the mode in which he handled his shield and his lance , were enough in themselves to convince the thousands of critical spectators that he was a dangerous opponent . Aylward , who stood in the front row of the archers with Simon , big John , and others of the Company , had been criticising the proceedings from the commencement with the ease and freedom of a man who had spent his life under arms and had learned in a hard school to know at a glance the points of a horse and his rider . He stared
