figure . `` `` We are sorely in need of a few good voyages , '' Girdlestone remarked , `` for things have been very slack of late . There is one very sad piece of intelligence here which takes away the satisfaction which we might otherwise feel . Three of the crew have died of fever . He does not mention the names . `` `` The devil ! '' said Ezra . `` We know very well what that means . Three women , each with an armful of brats , besieging the office and clamouring for a pension . Why are seamen such improvident dogs ? `` His father held up his white hand deprecatingly . `` I wish , '' he said , `` that you would treat these subjects with more reverence . What could be sadder than that the bread-winner of a family should be cut off ? It has grieved me more than I can tell . `` `` Then you intend to pension the wives ? '' Ezra said , with a sly smile . `` By no means , '' his father returned with decision . `` Girdlestone and Co. are not an insurance office . The labourer is worthy of his hire , but when his work in this world is over , his family must fall back upon what has been saved by his industry and thrift . It would be a dangerous precedent for us to allow pensions to the wives of these sailors , for it would deprive the others of all motive for laying their money by , and would indirectly encourage vice and dissipation . `` Ezra laughed , and continued to rattle his silver and keys . `` It is not upon this matter that I desired to speak to you , '' Girdlestone continued . `` It has , however , always been my practice to prefer matters of business to private affairs , however pressing . John Harston is said to be dying , and he has sent a message to me saying that he wishes to see me . It is inconvenient for me to leave the office , but I feel that it is my Christian duty to obey such a summons . I wish you , therefore , to look after things until I return . `` `` I can hardly believe that the news is true , '' Ezra said , in astonishment . `` There must be some mistake . Why , I spoke to him on 'Change last Monday . `` `` It is very sudden , '' his father answered , taking his broad-brimmed hat from a peg . `` There is no doubt about the fact , however . The doctor says that there is very little hope that he will survive until evening . It is a case of malignant typhoid . `` `` You are very old friends ? '' Ezra remarked , looking thoughtfully at his father . `` I have known him since we were boys together , '' the other replied , with a slight dry cough , which was the highest note of his limited emotional gamut . `` Your mother , Ezra , died upon the very day that Harston 's wife gave birth to this daughter of his , seventeen years ago . Mrs. Harston only survived a few days . I have heard him say that , perhaps , we should also go together . We are in the hands of a higher Power , however , and it seems that one shall be taken and another left . `` `` How will the money go if the doctors are right ? '' Ezra asked keenly . `` Every penny to the girl . She will be an heiress . There are no other relations that I know of , except the Dimsdales , and they have a fair fortune of their own . But I must go . `` `` By the way , malignant typhoid is very catching , is it not ? `` `` So they say , '' the merchant said quietly , and strode off through the counting-house.Ezra Girdlestone remained behind , stretching his legs In front of the empty grate . `` The governor is a hard nail , '' he soliloquized , as he stared down at the shining steel bars . `` Depend upon it , though , he feels this more than he shows . Why , it 's the only friend he ever had in the world -- -or ever will have , in all probability . However , it 's no business of mine , '' with which comforting reflection he began to whistle as he turned over the pages of the private day-book of the firm.It is possible that his son 's surmise was right , and that the gaunt , unemotional African merchant felt an unwonted heartache as he hailed a hansom and drove out to his friend 's house at Fulham . He and Harston had been charity schoolboys together , had roughed it together , risen together , and prospered together . When John Girdlestone was a raw-boned lad and Harston a chubby-faced urchin , the latter had come to look upon the other as his champion and guide . There are some minds which are parasitic in their nature . Alone they have little vitality , but they love to settle upon some stronger intellect , from which they may borrow their emotions and conclusions at second-hand . A strong , vigorous brain collects around it in time many others , whose mental processes are a feeble imitation of its own . Thus it came to pass that , as the years rolled on , Harston learned to lean more and more upon his old school-fellow , grafting many of his stern peculiarities upon his own simple vacuous nature , until he became a strange parody of the original . To him Girdlestone was the ideal man , Girdlestone 's ways the correct ways , and Girdlestone 's opinions the weightiest of all opinions . Forty years of this undeviating fidelity must , however he might conceal it , have made an impression upon the feelings of the elder man.Harston , by incessant attention to business and extreme parsimony , had succeeded in founding an export trading concern . In this he had followed the example of his friend . There was no fear of their interests ever coming into collision , as his operations were confined to the Mediterranean . The firm grew and prospered , until Harston began to be looked upon as a warm man in the City circles . His only child was Kate , a girl of seventeen . There were no other near relatives , save Dr. Dimsdale , a prosperous West-end physician . No wonder that Ezra Girdlestone 's active business mind , and perhaps that of his father too , should speculate as to the disposal of the fortune of the dying man.Girdlestone pushed open the iron gate and strode down the gravel walk which led to his friend 's house . A bright autumn sun shining out of a cloudless heaven bathed the green lawn and the many-coloured flower-beds in its golden light . The air , the leaves , the birds , all spoke of life . It was hard to think that death was closing its grip upon him who owned them all . A plump little gentleman in black was just descending the steps . `` Well , doctor , '' the merchant asked , `` how is your patient ? `` `` You 've not come with the intention of seeing him , have you ? '' the doctor asked , glancing up with some curiosity at the grey face and overhanging eyebrows of the merchant . `` Yes , I am going up to him now . `` `` It is a most virulent case of typhoid . He may die in an hour or he may live until nightfall , but nothing can save him . He will hardly recognize you , I fear , and you can do him no good . It is most infectious , and you are incurring a needless danger . I should strongly recommend you not to go . `` `` Why , you 've only just come down from him yourself , doctor . `` `` Ah , I 'm there in the way of duty . `` `` So am I , '' said the visitor decisively , and passing up the stone steps of the entrance strode into the hall . There was a large sitting-room upon the ground floor , through the open door of which the visitor saw a sight which arrested him for a moment . A young girl was sitting in a recess near the window , with her lithe , supple figure bent forward , and her hands clasped at the back of her head , while her elbows rested upon a small table in front of her . Her superb brown hair fell in a thick wave on either side over her white round arms , and the graceful curve of her beautiful neck might have furnished a sculptor with a study for a mourning Madonna . The doctor had just broken his sad tidings to her , and she was still in the first paroxysm of her grief -- -a grief too acute , as was evident even to the unsentimental mind of the merchant , to allow of any attempt at consolation . A greyhound appeared to think differently , for he had placed his fore-paws upon his young mistress 's lap , and was attempting to thrust his lean muzzle between her arms and to lick her face in token of canine sympathy . The merchant paused irresolutely for a moment , and then ascending the broad staircase he pushed open the door of Harston 's room and entered.The blinds were drawn down and the chamber was very dark . A pungent whiff of disinfectants issued from it , mingled with the dank , heavy smell of disease . The bed was in a far corner . Without seeing him , Girdlestone could hear the fast laboured breathing of the invalid . A trimly dressed nurse who had been sitting by the bedside rose , and , recognizing the visitor , whispered a few words to him and left the room . He pulled the cord of the Venetian blind so as to admit a few rays of daylight . The great chamber looked dreary and bare , as carpet and hangings had been removed to lessen the chance of future infection . John Girdlestone stepped softly across to the bedside and sat down by his dying friend.The sufferer was lying on his back , apparently unconscious of all around him . His glazed eyes were turned upwards towards the ceiling , and his parched lips were parted , while the breath came in quick , spasmodic gasps . Even the unskilled eye of the merchant could tell that the angel of death was hovering very near him . With an ungainly attempt at tenderness , which had something pathetic in it , he moistened a sponge and passed it over the sick man 's feverish brow . The latter turned his restless head round , and a gleam of recognition and gratitude came into his eyes . `` I knew that you would come , '' he said. '' Yes . I came the moment that I got your message . `` `` I am glad that you are here , '' the sufferer continued with a sigh of relief . From the brightened expression upon his pinched face , it seemed as if ,
