could not have believed it . `` `` God bless ye ! it 's done every day , and will be while there is insurance money to be gained , '' said Miggs , blowing a blue cloud up to the ceiling . `` It 's an easy thing to turn a few thousands a year while there are old ships to be bought , and offices which will insure them above their value . There was D'Arcy Campbell , of theSilvertown -- -what a trade that man did ! He was smart -- -tarnation smart ! Collisions was his line , and he worked 'em well . There war n't a skipper out of Liverpool as could get run down as nat'ral as he could . `` `` Get run down ? '' '' Aye . He 'd go lolloping about in the Channel if there was any fog on , steering for the lights o ' any steamers or headin ' round for all the fog whistles if it was too thick to see . Sooner or later , as sure as fate , he 'd get cut down to the water 's edge . Lor ' , it was a fine game ! Half a 'yard o ' print about his noble conduc ' in the newspapers , and maybe a leader about the British tar and unexpected emergencies . It once went the length o ' a subscription . Ha ! ha ! '' Miggs laughed until he choked . `` And what became of this British star ? '' asked the German . `` He 's still about . He 's in the passenger trade now. '' '' Potztausand ! '' Von Baumser ejaculated . `` I would not go as a passenger with him for something . `` `` There 's many a way that it 's done , sir , '' the mate added , filling up his glass again , and passing the bottle to the captain . `` There 's loadin ' a cranky vessel wi ' grain in bulk without usin ' partition boards . If you get a little water in , as you are bound to do with a ship o ' that kind , the grain will swell and swell until it bursts the seams open , and down ye go . Then there 's ignition o ' coal gas aboard o ' steamers . That 's a safe game , for nobody can deny it . And there are accidents to propellers . If the shaft o ' a propeller breaks in heavy weather it 's a bad look-out . I 've known ships leave the docks with their propellers half sawn through all round . Lor ' , there 's no end o ' the tricks o ' the trade . `` `` I can not believe , however , '' said Tom stoutly , `` that Mr. Girdlestone connives at such things . `` `` He 's on the waitin ' lay , '' the seaman answered . `` He does n't send 'em down , but he just hangs on , and keeps his insurances up , and trusts in Providence . He 's had some good hauls that way , though not o ' late . There was theBelindaat Cape Palmas . That was five thousand , clear , if it was a penny . And theSockatoo -- -that was a bad business ! She was never heard of , nor her crew . Went down at sea , and left no trace . `` `` The crew too ! '' Tom cried with horror . `` But how about yourselves , if what you say is true ? `` `` We are paid for the risk , '' said both the seamen , shrugging their shoulders . `` But there are Government inspectors ? '' '' Ha ! ha ! I dare say you 've seen the way some o ' them do their work ! '' said Miggs.Tom 's mind was filled with consternation at what he had heard . If the African merchant were capable of this , what might he not be capable of ? Was his word to be depended on under any circumstances ? And what sort of firm must this be , which turned so fair a side to the world and in which he had embarked his fortune ? All these thoughts flashed through his mind as he listened to the gossip of the garrulous old sea dogs . A greater shock still , however , was in store for him.Von Baumser had been listening to the conversation with an amused look upon his good-humoured face . `` Ah ! '' said he , suddenly striking in , `` I vill tell you something of your own firm which perhaps you do not know . Have you heard dat Mr. Ezra Girdlestone is about to be married ? `` `` To be married ! `` `` Oh yes ; I have heard It dis morning at Eckermann 's office . I think it is the talk of the City . `` `` Who 's the gal ? '' Miggs asked , with languid interest . `` I disremember her name , '' Von Baumser answered . `` It is a girl the major has met -- -the young lady who has lived in the same house , and is vat they call a warder . `` `` Not -- -not his ward ? '' cried Tom , springing to his feet and turning as white as a sheet . `` Not Miss Harston ? You do n't tell me that he is going to marry Miss Harston ? `` `` Dat is the name . Miss Harston it is , sure enough . `` `` It is a lie -- -an infamous lie ! '' Tom cried hotly . `` So it may be , '' Von Baumser answered serenely . `` I do but say vat I have heard , and heard more than once on good authority . `` `` If it is true there is villainy in it , '' cried Tom , with wild eyes , `` the blackest villainy that ever was done upon earth . I 'll go -- -I 'll see him to-night . By heavens , I shall know the truth ! '' He rushed furiously downstairs and through the bar . There was a cab near the door . `` Drive into London ! '' he cried ; `` 69 , Eccleston Square . I am on fire to be there ! '' The cabman sprang on the box , and they rattled away as fast as the horse would go.This sudden exit caused , as may be imagined , considerable surprise in the parlour of theCock and Cowslip . `` He 's a vera tumultuous young man , '' the mate remarked . `` He was off like a clipper in a hurricane . `` `` I perceive , '' said Von Baumser , `` dat he has left his hat behind him . I do now remember dat I have heard his name spoken with dat of dis very young lady by my good vriend , the major . `` `` Then he 's jealous belike , '' said Hamilton Miggs , with a knowing shake of the head . `` I 've felt that way myself before now . I rounded on Billy Barlow , o ' theFlying Scud , over that very thing , twelve months ago come Christmas . But I do n't think it was the thing for this young chap to cut away and never say 'With your leave , ' or 'By your leave , ' or as much as 'Good night , gentlemen all . ' It ai n't what you call straight up an ' down . `` `` It 's transcendental , '' said the mate severely ; `` that is what I call it . `` `` Ah , my vriends , '' the German put in , `` when a man is in love you must make excuses for him . I am very sure dat he did mean no offence . `` In spite of this assurance Captain Hamilton Miggs continued to be very sore upon the point . It was only by dint of many replenishings of his glass and many arguments that his companions could restore him to his pristine good humour . Meanwhile , the truant was speeding through the night with a fixed determination in his heart that he should have before morning such an understanding , one way or the other , as would never again leave room for a doubt.His father 's encouraging words had given Ezra Girdlestone fresh heart , and he had renewed his importunities with greater energy than ever . Never surely did any man devote every moment of his time more completely to the winning of a woman 's heart . From morning until night the one idea was ever before his mind and every little want of Kate 's was forestalled with a care and foresight which astonished her . The richest fruit and flowers found their way unexpectedly into her room ; her table was littered with the latest books from Mudie 's , and the newest pieces lay upon her music-stand . Nothing which attention and thoughtfulness could do was left undone either by the father or the son.In spite of these attentions , however , and the frequent solicitations of her guardian , Kate stood firmly to her colours . If the Tom of the present were false , she at least would be true to the memory of the Tom of other days , the lad who had first whispered words of love into her ears . Her ideal should remain with her whatever might befall . No other man could ever take the place of that.That Tom was from some unexplained and unaccountable reason false to her appeared to be beyond all question . Her trusting and innocent heart could not dream of the subtle network which was being wound round her . Her secluded life had left her very ignorant of the ways of the world , and the possibility of an elaborate deceit being practised upon her had never occurred to her . From the day that she heard the extract of the letter read by her guardian she never doubted but that such letters were received at the office by the man who professed to love her . How could she hesitate to believe it when it was confirmed by his avoidance of Eccleston Square and of herself ? The cause of it all was a mystery which no amount of speculation could clear up . Sometimes the poor girl would blame herself , as is the way of women in such cases . `` I have not seen enough of the world , '' she would say to herself . `` I have none of the charms of these women whom I read of in the novels . No doubt I seemed dull and insipid in his eyes . And yet -- -and yet -- - '' There always remained at the end of her cogitations the same vague sense of bewilderment and mystery.She endeavoured as far as possible to avoid Ezra Girdlestone , and stay in her room for the most part on the days when he was at home . He had , however , on the advice of his father , ceased pressing his suit except in the silent manner aforementioned , so that she gradually took courage , and ended by resuming her old habits . In her heart she pitied the young merchant very sincerely , for he was looking haggard and pale . `` Poor
