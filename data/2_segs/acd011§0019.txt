The Scowrers , '' said he , `` are the Eminent Order of Freemen ! `` The young man stared . `` Why , I am a member of that order myself. '' '' You ! I vould never have had you in my house if I had known it -- -not if you vere to pay me a hundred dollar a veek . `` `` What 's wrong with the order ? It 's for charity and good fellowship . The rules say so . `` `` Maybe in some places . Not here ! `` `` What is it here ? `` `` It 's a murder society , that 's vat it is . `` McMurdo laughed incredulously . `` How can you prove that ? '' he asked . `` Prove it ! Are there not fifty murders to prove it ? Vat about Milman and Van Shorst , and the Nicholson family , and old Mr. Hyam , and little Billy James , and the others ? Prove it ! Is there a man or a voman in this valley vat does not know it ? `` `` See here ! '' said McMurdo earnestly . `` I want you to take back what you 've said , or else make it good . One or the other you must do before I quit this room . Put yourself in my place . Here am I , a stranger in the town . I belong to a society that I know only as an innocent one . You 'll find it through the length and breadth of the States , but always as an innocent one . Now , when I am counting upon joining it here , you tell me that it is the same as a murder society called the Scowrers . I guess you owe me either an apology or else an explanation , Mr . Shafter . `` `` I can but tell you vat the whole vorld knows , mister . The bosses of the one are the bosses of the other . If you offend the one , it is the other vat vill strike you . We have proved it too often . `` `` That 's just gossip -- -I want proof ! '' said McMurdo . `` If you live here long you vill get your proof . But I forget that you are yourself one of them . You vill soon be as bad as the rest . But you vill find other lodgings , mister . I can not have you here . Is it not bad enough that one of these people come courting my Ettie , and that I dare not turn him down , but that I should have another for my boarder ? Yes , indeed , you shall not sleep here after to-night ! `` McMurdo found himself under sentence of banishment both from his comfortable quarters and from the girl whom he loved . He found her alone in the sitting-room that same evening , and he poured his troubles into her ear . `` Sure , your father is after giving me notice , '' he said . `` It 's little I would care if it was just my room , but indeed , Ettie , though it 's only a week that I 've known you , you are the very breath of life to me , and I ca n't live without you ! `` `` Oh , hush , Mr. McMurdo , do n't speak so ! '' said the girl . `` I have told you , have I not , that you are too late ? There is another , and if I have not promised to marry him at once , at least I can promise no one else . `` `` Suppose I had been first , Ettie , would I have had a chance ? `` The girl sank her face into her hands . `` I wish to heaven that you had been first ! '' she sobbed.McMurdo was down on his knees before her in an instant . `` For God 's sake , Ettie , let it stand at that ! '' he cried . `` Will you ruin your life and my own for the sake of this promise ? Follow your heart , acushla ! 'T is a safer guide than any promise before you knew what it was that you were saying . `` He had seized Ettie 's white hand between his own strong brown ones . `` Say that you will be mine , and we will face it out together ! `` `` Not here ? `` `` Yes , here . `` `` No , no , Jack ! '' His arms were round her now . `` It could not be here . Could you take me away ? `` A struggle passed for a moment over McMurdo 's face ; but it ended by setting like granite . `` No , here , '' he said . `` I 'll hold you against the world , Ettie , right here where we are ! `` `` Why should we not leave together ? `` `` No , Ettie , I ca n't leave here . `` `` But why ? `` `` I 'd never hold my head up again if I felt that I had been driven out . Besides , what is there to be afraid of ? Are we not free folks in a free country ? If you love me , and I you , who will dare to come between ? `` `` You do n't know , Jack . You 've been here too short a time . You do n't know this Baldwin . You do n't know McGinty and his Scowrers . `` `` No , I do n't know them , and I do n't fear them , and I do n't believe in them ! '' said McMurdo . `` I 've lived among rough men , my darling , and instead of fearing them it has always ended that they have feared me -- -always , Ettie . It 's mad on the face of it ! If these men , as your father says , have done crime after crime in the valley , and if everyone knows them by name , how comes it that none are brought to justice ? You answer me that , Ettie ! `` `` Because no witness dares to appear against them . He would not live a month if he did . Also because they have always their own men to swear that the accused one was far from the scene of the crime . But surely , Jack , you must have read all this . I had understood that every paper in the United States was writing about it . `` `` Well , I have read something , it is true ; but I had thought it was a story . Maybe these men have some reason in what they do . Maybe they are wronged and have no other way to help themselves . `` `` Oh , Jack , do n't let me hear you speak so ! That is how he speaks -- -the other one ! `` `` Baldwin -- -he speaks like that , does he ? `` `` And that is why I loathe him so . Oh , Jack , now I can tell you the truth . I loathe him with all my heart ; but I fear him also . I fear him for myself ; but above all I fear him for father . I know that some great sorrow would come upon us if I dared to say what I really felt . That is why I have put him off with half-promises . It was in real truth our only hope . But if you would fly with me , Jack , we could take father with us and live forever far from the power of these wicked men . `` Again there was the struggle upon McMurdo 's face , and again it set like granite . `` No harm shall come to you , Ettie -- -nor to your father either . As to wicked men , I expect you may find that I am as bad as the worst of them before we 're through . `` `` No , no , Jack ! I would trust you anywhere . `` McMurdo laughed bitterly . `` Good Lord ! how little you know of me ! Your innocent soul , my darling , could not even guess what is passing in mine . But , hullo , who 's the visitor ? `` The door had opened suddenly , and a young fellow came swaggering in with the air of one who is the master . He was a handsome , dashing young man of about the same age and build as McMurdo himself . Under his broad-brimmed black felt hat , which he had not troubled to remove , a handsome face with fierce , domineering eyes and a curved hawk-bill of a nose looked savagely at the pair who sat by the stove.Ettie had jumped to her feet full of confusion and alarm . `` I 'm glad to see you , Mr. Baldwin , '' said she . `` You 're earlier than I had thought . Come and sit down . `` Baldwin stood with his hands on his hips looking at McMurdo . `` Who is this ? '' he asked curtly . `` It 's a friend of mine , Mr. Baldwin , a new boarder here . Mr. McMurdo , may I introduce you to Mr . Baldwin ? `` The young men nodded in surly fashion to each other . `` Maybe Miss Ettie has told you how it is with us ? '' said Baldwin . `` I did n't understand that there was any relation between you . `` `` Did n't you ? Well , you can understand it now . You can take it from me that this young lady is mine , and you 'll find it a very fine evening for a walk . `` `` Thank you , I am in no humour for a walk . `` `` Are n't you ? '' The man 's savage eyes were blazing with anger . `` Maybe you are in a humour for a fight , Mr . Boarder ! `` `` That I am ! '' cried McMurdo , springing to his feet . `` You never said a more welcome word . `` `` For God 's sake , Jack ! Oh , for God 's sake ! '' cried poor , distracted Ettie . `` Oh , Jack , Jack , he will hurt you ! `` `` Oh , it 's Jack , is it ? '' said Baldwin with an oath . `` You 've come to that already , have you ? `` `` Oh , Ted , be reasonable -- -be kind ! For my sake , Ted , if ever you loved me , be big-hearted and forgiving ! `` `` I think , Ettie , that if you were to leave us alone we could get this thing settled , '' said McMurdo quietly . `` Or maybe , Mr. Baldwin , you will take a turn down the street with me . It 's a fine evening , and there 's some open ground beyond the next block . `` `` I 'll get even with you without needing to dirty my hands , '' said his enemy . `` You 'll wish you
