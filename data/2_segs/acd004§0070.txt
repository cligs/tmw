, and a roar like that of an angry lion -- - '' Notre Dame Du Guesclin ! St. Ives ! St . Ives ! '' The bow-man pulled back the bolt of the door , and thrust out the headpiece at the end of the bow . A clash , the clatter of the steel-cap upon the ground , and , ere the man who struck could heave up for another blow , the archer had passed his sword through his body . `` On , camarades , on ! '' he cried ; and , breaking fiercely past two men who threw themselves in his way , he sped down the broad corridor in the direction of the shouting.A sharp turning , and then a second one , brought them to the head of a short stair , from which they looked straight down upon the scene of the uproar . A square oak-floored hall lay beneath them , from which opened the doors of the principal guest-chambers . This hall was as light as day , for torches burned in numerous sconces upon the walls , throwing strange shadows from the tusked or antlered heads which ornamented them . At the very foot of the stair , close to the open door of their chamber , lay the seneschal and his wife : she with her head shorn from her shoulders , he thrust through with a sharpened stake , which still protruded from either side of his body . Three servants of the castle lay dead beside them , all torn and draggled , as though a pack of wolves had been upon them . In front of the central guest-chamber stood Du Guesclin and Sir Nigel , half-clad and unarmored , with the mad joy of battle gleaming in their eyes . Their heads were thrown back , their lips compressed , their blood-stained swords poised over their right shoulders , and their left feet thrown out . Three dead men lay huddled together in front of them : while a fourth , with the blood squirting from a severed vessel , lay back with updrawn knees , breathing in wheezy gasps . Further back -- -all panting together , like the wind in a tree -- -there stood a group of fierce , wild creatures , bare-armed and bare-legged , gaunt , unshaven , with deep-set murderous eyes and wild beast faces . With their flashing teeth , their bristling hair , their mad leapings and screamings , they seemed to Alleyne more like fiends from the pit than men of flesh and blood . Even as he looked , they broke into a hoarse yell and dashed once more upon the two knights , hurling themselves madly upon their sword-points ; clutching , scrambling , biting , tearing , careless of wounds if they could but drag the two soldiers to earth . Sir Nigel was thrown down by the sheer weight of them , and Sir Bertrand with his thunderous war-cry was swinging round his heavy sword to clear a space for him to rise , when the whistle of two long English arrows , and the rush of the squire and the two English archers down the stairs , turned the tide of the combat . The assailants gave back , the knights rushed forward , and in a very few moments the hall was cleared , and Hordle John had hurled the last of the wild men down the steep steps which led from the end of it . `` Do not follow them , '' cried Du Guesclin . `` We are lost if we scatter . For myself I care not a denier , though it is a poor thing to meet one 's end at the hands of such scum ; but I have my dear lady here , who must by no means be risked . We have breathing-space now , and I would ask you , Sir Nigel , what it is that you would counsel ? `` `` By St . Paul ! '' answered Sir Nigel , `` I can by no means understand what hath befallen us , save that I have been woken up by your battle-cry , and , rushing forth , found myself in the midst of this small bickering . Harrow and alas for the lady and the seneschal ! What dogs are they who have done this bloody deed ? `` `` They are the Jacks , the men of the brushwood . They have the castle , though I know not how it hath come to pass . Look from this window into the bailey . `` `` By heaven ! '' cried Sir Nigel , `` it is as bright as day with the torches . The gates stand open , and there are three thousand of them within the walls . See how they rush and scream and wave ! What is it that they thrust out through the postern door ? My God ! it is a man-at-arms , and they pluck him limb from limb like hounds on a wolf . Now another , and yet another . They hold the whole castle , for I see their faces at the windows . See , there are some with great bundles on their backs . `` `` It is dried wood from the forest . They pile them against the walls and set them in a blaze . Who is this who tries to check them ? By St. Ives ! it is the good priest who spake for them in the hall . He kneels , he prays , he implores ! What ! villains , would ye raise hands against those who have befriended you ? Ah , the butcher has struck him ! He is down ! They stamp him under their feet ! They tear off his gown and wave it in the air ! See now , how the flames lick up the walls ! Are there none left to rally round us ? With a hundred men we might hold our own . `` `` Oh , for my Company ! '' cried Sir Nigel . `` But where is Ford , Alleyne ? `` `` He is foully murdered , my fair lord . `` `` The saints receive him ! May he rest in peace ! But here come some at last who may give us counsel , for amid these passages it is ill to stir without a guide . `` As he spoke , a French squire and the Bohemian knight came rushing down the steps , the latter bleeding from a slash across his forehead . `` All is lost ! '' he cried . `` The castle is taken and on fire , the seneschal is slain , and there is nought left for us . `` `` On the contrary , '' quoth Sir Nigel , `` there is much left to us , for there is a very honorable contention before us , and a fair lady for whom to give our lives . There are many ways in which a man might die , but none better than this . `` `` You can tell us , Godfrey , '' said Du Guesclin to the French squire : `` how came these men into the castle , and what succors can we count upon ? By St. Ives ! if we come not quickly to some counsel we shall be burned like young rooks in a nest . `` The squire , a dark , slender stripling , spoke firmly and quickly , as one who was trained to swift action . `` There is a passage under the earth into the castle , '' said he , `` and through it some of the Jacks made their way , casting open the gates for the others . They have had help from within the walls , and the men-at-arms were heavy with wine : they must have been slain in their beds , for these devils crept from room to room with soft step and ready knife . Sir Amory the Hospitaller was struck down with an axe as he rushed before us from his sleeping-chamber . Save only ourselves , I do not think that there are any left alive . `` `` What , then , would you counsel ? `` `` That we make for the keep . It is unused , save in time of war , and the key hangs from my poor lord and master 's belt . `` `` There are two keys there . `` `` It is the larger . Once there , we might hold the narrow stair ; and at least , as the walls are of a greater thickness , it would be longer ere they could burn them . Could we but carry the lady across the bailey , all might be well with us . `` `` Nay ; the lady hath seen something of the work of war , '' said Tiphaine coming forth , as white , as grave , and as unmoved as ever . `` I would not be a hamper to you , my dear spouse and gallant friend . Rest assured of this , that if all else fail I have always a safeguard here '' -- -drawing a small silver-hilted poniard from her bosom -- - '' which sets me beyond the fear of these vile and blood-stained wretches . `` `` Tiphaine , '' cried Du Guesclin , `` I have always loved you ; and now , by Our Lady of Rennes ! I love you more than ever . Did I not know that your hand will be as ready as your words I would myself turn my last blow upon you , ere you should fall into their hands . Lead on , Godfrey ! A new golden pyx will shine in the minster of Dinan if we come safely through with it . `` The attention of the insurgents had been drawn away from murder to plunder , and all over the castle might be heard their cries and whoops of delight as they dragged forth the rich tapestries , the silver flagons , and the carved furniture . Down in the courtyard half-clad wretches , their bare limbs all mottled with blood-stains , strutted about with plumed helmets upon their heads , or with the Lady Rochefort 's silken gowns girt round their loins and trailing on the ground behind them . Casks of choice wine had been rolled out from the cellars , and starving peasants squatted , goblet in hand , draining off vintages which De Rochefort had set aside for noble and royal guests . Others , with slabs of bacon and joints of dried meat upon the ends of their pikes , held them up to the blaze or tore at them ravenously with their teeth . Yet all order had not been lost amongst them , for some hundreds of the better armed stood together in a silent group , leaning upon their rude weapons and looking up at the fire , which had spread so rapidly as to involve one whole side of the castle . Already Alleyne could hear the crackling and roaring of the flames , while the air was heavy with heat and full of the pungent whiff of burning wood.Under the guidance of the French squire the party passed down two narrow corridors . The first was empty , but at the head of the second stood a peasant sentry , who started off at the sight of them , yelling loudly to his comrades . `` Stop him , or we are undone ! '' cried Du Guesclin
