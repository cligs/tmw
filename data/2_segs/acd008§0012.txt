matter , from either a financial or an engineering point of view . I propose , however , to make a junction here , through Kiel between the German Ocean and the Baltic . It saves , you will observe , the whole journey round the coast of Denmark , and would facilitate our trade with Germany and Russia . Another very obvious improvement is to join the Forth and the Clyde , so as to connect Leith with the Irish and American routes . You see the blue line ? `` `` Quite so . `` `` And we will have a little cutting here . It will run from Uleaborg to Kem , and will connect the White Sea with the Gulf of Bothnia . We must not allow our sympathies to be insular , must we ? Our little charities should be cosmopolitan . We will try and give the good people of Archangel a better outlet for their furs and their tallow . `` `` But it will freeze . `` `` For six months in the year . Still , it will be something . Then we must do something for the East . It would never do to overlook the East . `` `` It would certainly be an oversight , '' said Robert , who was keenly alive to the comical side of the question . Raffles Haw , however , in deadly earnest , sat scratching away at his map with his blue pencil . `` Here is a point where we might be of some little use . If we cut through from Batoum to the Kura River we might tap the trade of the Caspian , and open up communication with all the rivers which run into it . You notice that they include a considerable tract of country . Then , again , I think that we might venture upon a little cutting between Beirut , on the Mediterranean , and the upper waters of the Euphrates , which would lead us into the Persian Gulf . Those are one or two of the more obvious canals which might knit the human race into a closer whole . `` `` Your plans are certainly stupendous , '' said Robert , uncertain whether to laugh or to be awe-struck . `` You will cease to be a man , and become one of the great forces of Nature , altering , moulding , and improving . `` `` That is precisely the view which I take of myself . That is why I feel my responsibility so acutely . `` `` But surely if you will do all this you may rest . It is a considerable programme . `` `` Not at all . I am a patriotic Briton , and I should like to do something to leave my name in the annals of my country . I should prefer , however , to do it after my own death , as anything in the shape of publicity and honour is very offensive to me . I have , therefore , put by eight hundred million in a place which shall be duly mentioned in my will , which I propose to devote to paying off the National Debt . I can not see that any harm could arise from its extinction . `` Robert sat staring , struck dumb by the audacity of the strange man 's words . `` Then there is the heating of the soil . There is room for improvement there . You have no doubt read of the immense yields which have resulted in Jersey and elsewhere , from the running of hot-water pipes through the soil . The crops are trebled and quadrupled . I would propose to try the experiment upon a larger scale . We might possibly reserve the Isle of Man to serve as a pumping and heating station . The main pipes would run to England , Ireland , and Scotland , where they would subdivide rapidly until they formed a network two feet deep under the whole country . A pipe at distances of a yard would suffice for every purpose . `` `` I am afraid , '' suggested Robert , `` that the water which left the Isle of Man warm might lose a little of its virtue before it reached Caithness , for example . `` `` There need not be any difficulty there . Every few miles a furnace might be arranged to keep up the temperature . These are a few of my plans for the future , Robert , and I shall want the co-operation of disinterested men like yourself in all of them . But how brightly the sun shines , and how sweet the countryside looks ! The world is very beautiful , and I should like to leave it happier than I found it . Let us walk out together , Robert , and you will tell me of any fresh cases where I may be of assistance . `` Whatever good Mr. Raffles Haw 's wealth did to the world , there could be no doubt that there were cases where it did harm . The very contemplation and thought of it had upon many a disturbing and mischievous effect . Especially was this the case with the old gunmaker . From being merely a querulous and grasping man , he had now become bitter , brooding , and dangerous . Week by week , as he saw the tide of wealth flow as it were through his very house without being able to divert the smallest rill to nourish his own fortunes , he became more wolfish and more hungry-eyed . He spoke less of his own wrongs , but he brooded more , and would stand for hours on Tamfield Hill looking down at the great palace beneath , as a thirst-stricken man might gaze at the desert mirage.He had worked , and peeped , and pried , too , until there were points upon which he knew more than either his son or his daughter . `` I suppose that you still do n't know where your friend gets his money ? '' he remarked to Robert one morning , as they walked together through the village . `` No , father , I do not . I only know that he spends it very well. '' '' Well ! '' snarled the old man . `` Yes , very well ! He has helped every tramp and slut and worthless vagabond over the countryside , but he will not advance a pound , even on the best security , to help a respectable business man to fight against misfortune . `` `` My dear father , I really can not argue with you about it , '' said Robert . `` I have already told you more than once what I think . Mr. Haw 's object is to help those who are destitute . He looks upon us as his equals , and would not presume to patronise us , or to act as if we could not help ourselves . It would be a humiliation to us to take his money. '' '' Pshaw ! Besides , it is only a question of an advance , and advances are made every day among business men . How can you talk such nonsense , Robert ? `` Early as it was , his son could see from his excited , quarrelsome manner that the old man had been drinking . The habit had grown upon him of late , and it was seldom now that he was entirely sober. '' Mr . Raffles Haw is the best judge , '' said Robert coldly . `` If he earns the money , he has a right to spend it as he likes . `` `` And how does he earn it ? You do n't know , Robert . You do n't know that you are n't aiding and abetting a felony when you help him to fritter it away . Was ever so much money earned in an honest fashion ? I tell you there never was . I tell you , also , that lumps of gold are no more to that man than chunks of coal to the miners over yonder . He could build his house of them and think nothing of it . `` `` I know that he is very rich , father . I think , however , that he has an extravagant way of talking sometimes , and that his imagination carries him away . I have heard him talk of plans which the richest man upon earth could not possibly hope to carry through . `` `` Do n't you make any mistake , my son . Your poor old father is n't quite a fool , though he is only an honest broken merchant . '' He looked up sideways at his son with a wink and a most unpleasant leer . `` Where there 's money I can smell it . There 's money there , and heaps of it . It 's my belief that he is the richest man in the world , though how he came to be so I should not like to guarantee . I 'm not quite blind yet , Robert . Have you seen the weekly waggon ? `` `` The weekly waggon ! `` `` Yes , Robert . You see I can find some news for you yet . It is due this morning . Every Saturday morning you will see the waggon come in . Why , here it is now , as I am a living man , coming round the curve . `` Robert glanced back and saw a great heavy waggon drawn by two strong horses lumbering slowly along the road which led to the New Hall . From the efforts of the animals and its slow pace the contents seemed to be of great weight . `` Just you wait here , '' old McIntyre cried , plucking at his son 's sleeve with his thin bony hand . `` Wait here and see it pass . Then we will watch what becomes of it . `` They stood by the side of the road until it came abreast of them . The waggon was covered with tarpaulin sheetings in front and at the sides , but behind some glimpse could be caught of the contents . They consisted , as far as Robert could see , of a number of packets of the same shape , each about two feet long and six inches high , arranged symmetrically upon the top of each other . Each packet was surrounded by a covering of coarse sacking . `` What do you think of that ? '' asked old McIntyre triumphantly as the load creaked past . `` Why , father ? What do you make of it ? `` `` I have watched it , Robert -- -I have watched it every Saturday , and I had my chance of looking a little deeper into it . You remember the day when the elm blew down , and the road was blocked until they could saw it in two . That was on a Saturday , and the waggon came to a stand until they could clear a way for it . I was there , Robert , and I saw my chance . I strolled behind the waggon , and I placed my hands upon one of those packets . They look small , do they not ? It would take a strong man to lift one . They are heavy , Robert , heavy , and hard with the hardness of metal . I tell
