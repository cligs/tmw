for ever passing through his hands for those who were needy , and if he were needy himself his friend would surely not grudge it to him . So the Roman galleys still remained faintly outlined upon the great canvas , while Robert 's days were spent either in the luxurious library at the Hall , or in strolling about the country listening to tales of trouble , and returning like a tweed-suited ministering angel to carry Raffles Haw 's help to the unfortunate . It was not an ambitious life , but it was one which was very congenial to his weak and easy-going nature.Robert had observed that fits of depression had frequently come upon the millionaire , and it had sometimes struck him that the enormous sums which he spent had possibly made a serious inroad into his capital , and that his mind was troubled as to the future . His abstracted manner , his clouded brow , and his bent head all spoke of a soul which was weighed down with care , and it was only in Laura 's presence that he could throw off the load of his secret trouble . For five hours a day he buried himself in the laboratory and amused himself with his hobby , but it was one of his whims that no one , neither any of his servants , nor even Laura or Robert , should ever cross the threshold of that outlying building . Day after day he vanished into it , to reappear hours afterwards pale and exhausted , while the whirr of machinery and the smoke which streamed from his high chimney showed how considerable were the operations which he undertook single-handed . `` Could I not assist you in any way ? '' suggested Robert , as they sat together after luncheon in the smoking-room . `` I am convinced that you over-try your strength . I should be so glad to help you , and I know a little of chemistry . `` `` Do you , indeed ? '' said Raffles Haw , raising his eyebrows . `` I had no idea of that ; it is very seldom that the artistic and the scientific faculties go together . `` `` I do n't know that I have either particularly developed . But I have taken classes , and I worked for two years in the laboratory at Sir Josiah Mason 's Institute . `` `` I am delighted to hear it , '' Haw replied with emphasis . `` That may be of great importance to us . It is very possible -- -indeed , almost certain -- -that I shall avail myself of your offer of assistance , and teach you something of my chemical methods , which I may say differ considerably from those of the orthodox school . The time , however , is hardly ripe for that . What is it , Jones ? `` `` A note , sir . `` The butler handed it in upon a silver salver . Haw broke the seal and ran his eye over it. '' Tut ! tut ! It is from Lady Morsley , asking me to the Lord-Lieutenant 's ball . I can not possibly accept . It is very kind of them , but I do wish they would leave me alone . Very well , Jones . I shall write . Do you know , Robert , I am often very unhappy . `` He frequently called the young artist by his Christian name , especially in his more confidential moments . `` I have sometimes feared that you were , '' said the other sympathetically . `` But how strange it seems , you who are yet young , healthy , with every faculty for enjoyment , and a millionaire . `` `` Ah , Robert , '' cried Haw , leaning back in his chair , and sending up thick blue wreaths from his pipe . `` You have put your finger upon my trouble . If I were a millionaire I might be happy , but , alas , I am no millionaire ! `` `` Good heavens ! '' gasped Robert.Cold seemed to shoot to his inmost soul as it flashed upon him that this was a prelude to a confession of impending bankruptcy , and that all this glorious life , all the excitement and the colour and change , were about to vanish into thin air . `` No millionaire ! '' he stammered . `` No , Robert ; I am a billionaire -- -perhaps the only one in the world . That is what is on my mind , and why I am unhappy sometimes . I feel that I should spend this money -- -that I should put it in circulation -- -and yet it is so hard to do it without failing to do good -- -without doing positive harm . I feel my responsibility deeply . It weighs me down . Am I justified in continuing to live this quiet life when there are so many millions whom I might save and comfort if I could but reach them ? `` Robert heaved a long sigh of relief . `` Perhaps you take too grave a view of your responsibilities , '' he said . `` Everybody knows that the good which you have done is immense . What more could you desire ? If you really wished to extend your benevolence further , there are organised charities everywhere which would be very glad of your help . `` `` I have the names of two hundred and seventy of them , '' Haw answered . `` You must run your eye over them some time , and see if you can suggest any others . I send my annual mite to each of them . I do n't think there is much room for expansion in that direction . `` `` Well , really you have done your share , and more than your share . I would settle down to lead a happy life , and think no more of the matter . `` `` I could not do that , '' Haw answered earnestly . `` I have not been singled out to wield this immense power simply in order that I might lead a happy life . I can never believe that . Now , can you not use your imagination , Robert , and devise methods by which a man who has command of -- -well , let us say , for argument 's sake , boundless wealth , could benefit mankind by it , without taking away any one 's independence or in any way doing harm ? `` `` Well , really , now that I come to think of it , it is a very difficult problem , '' said Robert . `` Now I will submit a few schemes to you , and you may give me your opinion on them . Supposing that such a man were to buy ten square miles of ground here in Staffordshire , and were to build upon it a neat city , consisting entirely of clean , comfortable little four-roomed houses , furnished in a simple style , with shops and so forth , but no public-houses . Supposing , too , that he were to offer a house free to all the homeless folk , all the tramps , and broken men , and out-of-workers in Great Britain . Then , having collected them together , let him employ them , under fitting superintendence , upon some colossal piece of work which would last for many years , and perhaps be of permanent value to humanity . Give them a good rate of pay , and let their hours of labour be reasonable , and those of recreation be pleasant . Might you not benefit them and benefit humanity at one stroke ? `` `` But what form of work could you devise which would employ so vast a number for so long a time , and yet not compete with any existing industry ? To do the latter would simply mean to shift the misery from one class to another . `` `` Precisely so . I should compete with no one . What I thought of doing was of sinking a shaft through the earth 's crust , and of establishing rapid communication with the Antipodes . When you had got a certain distance down -- -how far is an interesting mathematical problem -- -the centre of gravity would be beneath you , presuming that your boring was not quite directed towards the centre , and you could then lay down rails and tunnel as if you were on the level . `` Then for the first time it flashed into Robert McIntyre 's head that his father 's chance words were correct , and that he was in the presence of a madman . His great wealth had clearly turned his brain , and made him a monomaniac . He nodded indulgently , as when one humours a child . `` It would be very nice , '' he said . `` I have heard , however , that the interior of the earth is molten , and your workmen would need to be Salamanders . `` `` The latest scientific data do not bear out the idea that the earth is so hot , '' answered Raffles Haw . `` It is certain that the increased temperature in coal mines depends upon the barometric pressure . There are gases in the earth which may be ignited , and there are combustible materials as we see in the volcanoes ; but if we came across anything of the sort in our borings , we could turn a river or two down the shaft , and get the better of it in that fashion . `` `` It would be rather awkward if the other end of your shaft came out under the Pacific Ocean , '' said Robert , choking down his inclination to laugh . `` I have had estimates and calculations from the first living engineers -- -French , English , and American . The point of exit of the tunnel could be calculated to the yard . That portfolio in the corner is full of sections , plans , and diagrams . I have agents employed in buying up land , and if all goes well , we may get to work in the autumn . That is one device which may produce results . Another is canal-cutting . `` `` Ah , there you would compete with the railways . `` `` You do n't quite understand . I intend to cut canals through every neck of land where such a convenience would facilitate commerce . Such a scheme , when unaccompanied by any toll upon vessels , would , I think , be a very judicious way of helping the human race . `` `` And where , pray , would you cut the canals ? '' asked Robert . `` I have a map of the world here , '' Haw answered , rising , and taking one down from the paper-rack . `` You see the blue pencil marks . Those are the points where I propose to establish communication . Of course , I should begin by the obvious duty of finishing the Panama business. '' '' Naturally . '' The man 's lunacy was becoming more and more obvious , and yet there was such precision and coolness in his manner , that Robert found himself against his own reason endorsing and speculating over his plans . `` The Isthmus of Corinth also occurs to one . That , however , is a small
