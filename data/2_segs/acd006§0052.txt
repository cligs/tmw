Mister Ezra . When you want anything done you remember it , but if you have no use for me , then there is never a kind look on your face or a kind word from your lips . If I was a dog you could not use me worse . I could stand your harshness . I could stand the blow you gave me , and forgive you for it , from my heart ; but , oh ! it cut me to the very soul to be standing by and waiting while you were making up to another woman . It was more than I can bear . `` `` Never mind , my girl , '' said Ezra in a soothing voice ; `` that 's all over and done with . See what I 've brought you . '' He rummaged in his pocket and produced a little parcel of tissue paper , which he handed to her.It was only a small silver anchor , with Scotch pebbles inlaid in it . The woman 's eyes , however , flashed as she looked at it , and she raised it to her lips and kissed it passionately . `` God bless it and you too ! '' she said . `` I 've heard tell as the anchor 's the emblem of hope , and so it shall be with me . Oh , Ezra , you may travel far and meet them as can play and can sing and do many a thing as I ca n't do , but you 'll never get one who will love you as dearly and well . `` `` I know it , my lass , I know it , '' said Ezra , smoothing down her dark hair , for she had dropped upon her knees beside the couch . `` I 've never met your equal yet . That 's why I want you down at Bedsworth . I must have some one there that I can trust . `` What am I to do down at Bedsworth ? '' she asked . `` I want you to be Miss Harston 's companion . She 'll be lonely , and will need some other woman in the house to look after her . `` `` Curse her ! '' cried Rebecca , springing to her feet with flashing eyes . `` You are still thinking of her , then ! She must have this ; she must have that ! Everything else is as dirt before her . I 'll not serve her -- -so there ! You can knock me down if you like . `` `` Rebecca , '' said Ezra slowly , `` do you hate Kate Harston ? `` `` From the bottom of my soul , '' she answered . `` Well , if you hate her , I tell you that I hate her a thousand times more . You thought that I was fond of her . All that is over now , and you may set your mind at ease . `` `` Why do you want her so well cared for , then ? '' asked the girl suspiciously . `` I want some one who feels towards her as I do to be by her side . If she were never to come back from Bedsworth it would be nothing to me . `` `` What makes you look at me so strangely ? '' she said , shrinking away from his intense gaze . `` Never mind . You go . You will understand many things in time which seem strange to you now . At present if you will do what I ask you will oblige me greatly . Will you go ? `` `` Yes , I will go . `` `` There 's a good lass . Give us a kiss , my girl . You have the right spirit in you . I 'll let you know when the train goes to-morrow , and I will write to my father to expect you . Now , off with you , or you 'll have them gossiping downstairs . Good night . `` `` Good night , Mister Ezra , '' said the girl , with her hand upon the handle of the library door . `` You 've made my heart glad this night . I live in hope -- -ever in hope . `` `` I wonder what the deuce she hopes about , '' the young merchant said to himself as she closed the door behind her . `` Hopes I 'll marry her , I suppose . She must be of a very sanguine disposition . A girl like that might be invaluable down at Bedsworth . If we had no other need for her , she would be an excellent spy . '' He lay for some little time on the couch with bent brow and pursed lips , musing over the possibilities of the future.While this dialogue had been going on in the library of Eccleston Square , Tom Dimsdale was still wending his way homewards with a feeling of weight in his mind and a presentiment of misfortune which overshadowed his whole soul . In vain he assured himself that this disappearance of Kate 's was but temporary , and that the rumour of an engagement between her and Ezra was too ridiculous to be believed for a moment . Argue it as he would , the same dread , horrible feeling of impending trouble weighed upon him . Impossible as it was to imagine that Kate was false to him , it was strange that on the very day that this rumour reached his ears she should disappear from London . How bitterly he regretted now that he had allowed himself to be persuaded by John Girdlestone into ceasing to communicate with her . He began to realize that he had been duped , and that all these specious promises as to a future consent to their union had been so many baits to amuse him while the valuable present was slipping away . What could he do now to repair the past ? His only course was to wait for the morrow and see whether the senior partner would appear at the offices . If he did so , the young man was determined that he should have an understanding with him.So downcast was Tom that , on arriving at Phillimore Gardens , he would have slipped off to his room at once had he not met his burly father upon the stairs . `` Bed ! '' roared the old man upon hearing his son 's proposition . `` Nothing of the sort , sir . Come down into the parlour and smoke a pipe with me . Your mother has been waiting for you all the evening . `` `` I am sorry to be late , mother , '' the lad said , kissing the old lady . `` I have been down at the docks all day and have been busy and worried. '' Mrs . Dimsdale was sitting in her chair beside the fire , knitting , when her son came in . At the sound of his voice she glanced anxiously up at his face , with all her motherly instincts on the alert . `` What is it , my boy ? '' she said . `` You do n't look yourself . Something has gone wrong with you . Surely you 're not keeping anything secret from your old mother ? `` `` Do n't be so foolish as that , my boy , '' said the doctor earnestly . `` If you have anything on your mind , out with it . There 's nothing so far wrong but that it ca n't be set right , I 'll be bound . `` Thus pressed , their son told them all that had happened , the rumour which he had heard from Von Baumser at theCock and Cowslip , and the subsequent visit to Eccleston Square . `` I can hardly realize it all yet , '' he said in conclusion . `` My head seems to be in a whirl , and I ca n't reason about it . `` The old couple listened very attentively to his narrative , and were silent some little time after he had finished . His mother first broke the silence . `` I was always sure , '' she said , `` that we were wrong to stop our correspondence at the request of Mr . Girdlestone . `` `` It 's easy enough to say that now , '' said Tom ruefully . `` At the time it seemed as if we had no alternative . `` `` There 's no use crying over spilt milk , '' remarked the old physician , who had been very grave during his son 's narrative . `` We must set to work and get things right again . There is one thing very certain , Tom , and that is that Kate Harston is a girl who never did or could do a dishonourable thing . If she said that she would wait for you , my boy , you may feel perfectly safe ; and if you doubt her for one moment you ought to be deuced well ashamed of yourself . `` `` Well said , governor ! '' cried Tom , with beaming face . `` Now , that is exactly my own feeling , but there is so much to be explained . Why have they left London , and where have they gone to ? `` `` No doubt that old scoundrel Girdlestone thought that your patience would soon come to an end , so he got the start of you by carrying the girl off into the country . `` `` And if he has done this , what can I do ? '' '' Nothing . It is entirely within his right to do it . `` `` And have her stowed away in some little cottage in the country , with that brute Ezra Girdlestone hanging round her all the time . It is the thought of that that drives me wild . `` `` You trust in her , my boy , '' said the old doctor . `` We 'll try our best in the meantime to find out where she has gone to . If she is unhappy or needs a friend you may be sure that she will write to your mother . `` `` Yes , there is always that hope , '' exclaimed Tom , in a more cheerful voice . `` To-morrow I may learn something at the office . `` `` Do n't make the mistake of quarrelling with the Girdlestones . After all , they are within their rights in doing what they appear to have done . `` `` They may be within their legal rights , '' Tom cried indignantly ; `` but the old man made a deliberate compact with me , which he has broken . `` `` Never mind . Do n't give them an advantage by losing your temper . '' The doctor chatted away over the matter for some time , and his words , together with those of his mother , cheered the young fellow 's heart . Nevertheless , after they had retired to their rooms , Dr. Dimsdale continued to be very thoughtful and very grave . `` I do n't like it , '' he said , more than once . `` I do n't like the idea of the poor girl being left entirely in the hands of that pair of beauties . God grant that no harm
