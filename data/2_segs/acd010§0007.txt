upon which I saw and shot the pterodactyl was more accessible . Being something of a cragsman , I did manage to get half way to the top of that . From that height I had a better idea of the plateau upon the top of the crags . It appeared to be very large ; neither to east nor to west could I see any end to the vista of green-capped cliffs . Below , it is a swampy , jungly region , full of snakes , insects , and fever . It is a natural protection to this singular country . `` `` Did you see any other trace of life ? `` `` No , sir , I did not ; but during the week that we lay encamped at the base of the cliff we heard some very strange noises from above . `` `` But the creature that the American drew ? How do you account for that ? `` `` We can only suppose that he must have made his way to the summit and seen it there . We know , therefore , that there is a way up . We know equally that it must be a very difficult one , otherwise the creatures would have come down and overrun the surrounding country . Surely that is clear ? `` `` But how did they come to be there ? `` `` I do not think that the problem is a very obscure one , '' said the Professor ; `` there can only be one explanation . South America is , as you may have heard , a granite continent . At this single point in the interior there has been , in some far distant age , a great , sudden volcanic upheaval . These cliffs , I may remark , are basaltic , and therefore plutonic . An area , as large perhaps as Sussex , has been lifted up en bloc with all its living contents , and cut off by perpendicular precipices of a hardness which defies erosion from all the rest of the continent . What is the result ? Why , the ordinary laws of Nature are suspended . The various checks which influence the struggle for existence in the world at large are all neutralized or altered . Creatures survive which would otherwise disappear . You will observe that both the pterodactyl and the stegosaurus are Jurassic , and therefore of a great age in the order of life . They have been artificially conserved by those strange accidental conditions . `` `` But surely your evidence is conclusive . You have only to lay it before the proper authorities . `` `` So in my simplicity , I had imagined , '' said the Professor , bitterly . `` I can only tell you that it was not so , that I was met at every turn by incredulity , born partly of stupidity and partly of jealousy . It is not my nature , sir , to cringe to any man , or to seek to prove a fact if my word has been doubted . After the first I have not condescended to show such corroborative proofs as I possess . The subject became hateful to me -- -I would not speak of it . When men like yourself , who represent the foolish curiosity of the public , came to disturb my privacy I was unable to meet them with dignified reserve . By nature I am , I admit , somewhat fiery , and under provocation I am inclined to be violent . I fear you may have remarked it . `` I nursed my eye and was silent . `` My wife has frequently remonstrated with me upon the subject , and yet I fancy that any man of honor would feel the same . To-night , however , I propose to give an extreme example of the control of the will over the emotions . I invite you to be present at the exhibition . '' He handed me a card from his desk . `` You will perceive that Mr. Percival Waldron , a naturalist of some popular repute , is announced to lecture at eight-thirty at the Zoological Institute 's Hall upon 'The Record of the Ages . ' I have been specially invited to be present upon the platform , and to move a vote of thanks to the lecturer . While doing so , I shall make it my business , with infinite tact and delicacy , to throw out a few remarks which may arouse the interest of the audience and cause some of them to desire to go more deeply into the matter . Nothing contentious , you understand , but only an indication that there are greater deeps beyond . I shall hold myself strongly in leash , and see whether by this self-restraint I attain a more favorable result . `` `` And I may come ? '' I asked eagerly . `` Why , surely , '' he answered , cordially . He had an enormously massive genial manner , which was almost as overpowering as his violence . His smile of benevolence was a wonderful thing , when his cheeks would suddenly bunch into two red apples , between his half-closed eyes and his great black beard . `` By all means , come . It will be a comfort to me to know that I have one ally in the hall , however inefficient and ignorant of the subject he may be . I fancy there will be a large audience , for Waldron , though an absolute charlatan , has a considerable popular following . Now , Mr. Malone , I have given you rather more of my time than I had intended . The individual must not monopolize what is meant for the world . I shall be pleased to see you at the lecture to-night . In the meantime , you will understand that no public use is to be made of any of the material that I have given you . `` `` But Mr. McArdle -- -my news editor , you know -- -will want to know what I have done . `` `` Tell him what you like . You can say , among other things , that if he sends anyone else to intrude upon me I shall call upon him with a riding-whip . But I leave it to you that nothing of all this appears in print . Very good . Then the Zoological Institute 's Hall at eight-thirty to-night . '' I had a last impression of red cheeks , blue rippling beard , and intolerant eyes , as he waved me out of the room.What with the physical shocks incidental to my first interview with Professor Challenger and the mental ones which accompanied the second , I was a somewhat demoralized journalist by the time I found myself in Enmore Park once more . In my aching head the one thought was throbbing that there really was truth in this man 's story , that it was of tremendous consequence , and that it would work up into inconceivable copy for the Gazette when I could obtain permission to use it . A taxicab was waiting at the end of the road , so I sprang into it and drove down to the office . McArdle was at his post as usual . `` Well , '' he cried , expectantly , `` what may it run to ? I 'm thinking , young man , you have been in the wars . Do n't tell me that he assaulted you . `` `` We had a little difference at first . `` `` What a man it is ! What did you do ? `` `` Well , he became more reasonable and we had a chat . But I got nothing out of him -- -nothing for publication . `` `` I 'm not so sure about that . You got a black eye out of him , and that 's for publication . We ca n't have this reign of terror , Mr. Malone . We must bring the man to his bearings . I 'll have a leaderette on him to-morrow that will raise a blister . Just give me the material and I will engage to brand the fellow for ever . Professor Munchausen -- -how 's that for an inset headline ? Sir John Mandeville redivivus -- -Cagliostro -- -all the imposters and bullies in history . I 'll show him up for the fraud he is . `` `` I would n't do that , sir . `` `` Why not ? `` `` Because he is not a fraud at all. '' '' What ! '' roared McArdle . `` You do n't mean to say you really believe this stuff of his about mammoths and mastodons and great sea sairpents ? `` `` Well , I do n't know about that . I do n't think he makes any claims of that kind . But I do believe he has got something new . `` `` Then for Heaven 's sake , man , write it up ! `` `` I 'm longing to , but all I know he gave me in confidence and on condition that I did n't . '' I condensed into a few sentences the Professor 's narrative . `` That 's how it stands . `` McArdle looked deeply incredulous . `` Well , Mr. Malone , '' he said at last , `` about this scientific meeting to-night ; there can be no privacy about that , anyhow . I do n't suppose any paper will want to report it , for Waldron has been reported already a dozen times , and no one is aware that Challenger will speak . We may get a scoop , if we are lucky . You 'll be there in any case , so you 'll just give us a pretty full report . I 'll keep space up to midnight . `` My day was a busy one , and I had an early dinner at the Savage Club with Tarp Henry , to whom I gave some account of my adventures . He listened with a sceptical smile on his gaunt face , and roared with laughter on hearing that the Professor had convinced me . `` My dear chap , things do n't happen like that in real life . People do n't stumble upon enormous discoveries and then lose their evidence . Leave that to the novelists . The fellow is as full of tricks as the monkey-house at the Zoo . It 's all bosh . `` `` But the American poet ? `` `` He never existed . `` `` I saw his sketch-book . `` `` Challenger 's sketch-book . `` `` You think he drew that animal ? `` `` Of course he did . Who else ? `` `` Well , then , the photographs ? `` `` There was nothing in the photographs . By your own admission you only saw a bird . `` `` A pterodactyl . `` `` That 's what HE says . He put the pterodactyl into your head . `` `` Well , then , the bones ? `` `` First one out of an Irish stew . Second one vamped up for the occasion . If you are clever and know your business you can fake a bone as easily as you can a photograph . `` I began to feel uneasy . Perhaps , after all , I had been premature in my acquiescence . Then I had a sudden happy thought . ``
