edge of his linen cyclas . Quick as a panther , Alleyne sprang in with a thrust , but Tranter , who was as active as he was strong , had already recovered himself and turned it aside with a movement of his heavy blade . Again he whizzed in a blow which made the spectators hold their breath , and again Alleyne very quickly and swiftly slipped from under it , and sent back two lightning thrusts which the other could scarce parry . So close were they to each other that Alleyne had no time to spring back from the next cut , which beat down his sword and grazed his forehead , sending the blood streaming into his eyes and down his cheeks . He sprang out beyond sword sweep , and the pair stood breathing heavily , while the crowd of young squires buzzed their applause . `` Bravely struck on both sides ! '' cried Roger Harcomb . `` You have both won honor from this meeting , and it would be sin and shame to let it go further . `` `` You have done enough , Edricson , '' said Norbury . `` You have carried yourself well , '' cried several of the older squires . `` For my part , I have no wish to slay this young man , '' said Tranter , wiping his heated brow . `` Does this gentleman crave my pardon for having used me despitefully ? '' asked Alleyne . `` Nay , not I . `` `` Then stand on your guard , sir ! '' With a clatter and dash the two blades met once more , Alleyne pressing in so as to keep within the full sweep of the heavy blade , while Tranter as continually sprang back to have space for one of his fatal cuts . A three-parts-parried blow drew blood from Alleyne 's left shoulder , but at the same moment he wounded Tranter slightly upon the thigh . Next instant , however , his blade had slipped into the fatal notch , there was a sharp cracking sound with a tinkling upon the ground , and he found a splintered piece of steel fifteen inches long was all that remained to him of his weapon . `` Your life is in my hands ! '' cried Tranter , with a bitter smile . `` Nay , nay , he makes submission ! '' broke in several squires . `` Another sword ! '' cried Ford . `` Nay , sir , '' said Harcomb , `` that is not the custom . `` `` Throw down your hilt , Edricson , '' cried Norbury. '' Never ! '' said Alleyne . `` Do you crave my pardon , sir ? `` `` You are mad to ask it . `` `` Then on guard again ! '' cried the young squire , and sprang in with a fire and a fury which more than made up for the shortness of his weapon . It had not escaped him that his opponent was breathing in short , hoarse gasps , like a man who is dizzy with fatigue . Now was the time for the purer living and the more agile limb to show their value . Back and back gave Tranter , ever seeking time for a last cut . On and on came Alleyne , his jagged point now at his foeman 's face , now at his throat , now at his chest , still stabbing and thrusting to pass the line of steel which covered him . Yet his experienced foeman knew well that such efforts could not be long sustained . Let him relax for one instant , and his death-blow had come . Relax he must ! Flesh and blood could not stand the strain . Already the thrusts were less fierce , the foot less ready , although there was no abatement of the spirit in the steady gray eyes . Tranter , cunning and wary from years of fighting , knew that his chance had come . He brushed aside the frail weapon which was opposed to him , whirled up his great blade , sprang back to get the fairer sweep -- -and vanished into the waters of the Garonne.So intent had the squires , both combatants and spectators , been on the matter in hand , that all thought of the steep bank and swift still stream had gone from their minds . It was not until Tranter , giving back before the other 's fiery rush , was upon the very brink , that a general cry warned him of his danger . That last spring , which he hoped would have brought the fight to a bloody end , carried him clear of the edge , and he found himself in an instant eight feet deep in the ice-cold stream . Once and twice his gasping face and clutching fingers broke up through the still green water , sweeping outwards in the swirl of the current . In vain were sword-sheaths , apple-branches and belts linked together thrown out to him by his companions . Alleyne had dropped his shattered sword and was standing , trembling in every limb , with his rage all changed in an instant to pity . For the third time the drowning man came to the surface , his hands full of green slimy water-plants , his eyes turned in despair to the shore . Their glance fell upon Alleyne , and he could not withstand the mute appeal which he read in them . In an instant he , too , was in the Garonne , striking out with powerful strokes for his late foeman.Yet the current was swift and strong , and , good swimmer as he was , it was no easy task which Alleyne had set himself . To clutch at Tranter and to seize him by the hair was the work of a few seconds , but to hold his head above water and to make their way out of the current was another matter . For a hundred strokes he did not seem to gain an inch . Then at last , amid a shout of joy and praise from the bank , they slowly drew clear into more stagnant water , at the instant that a rope , made of a dozen sword-belts linked together by the buckles , was thrown by Ford into their very hands . Three pulls from eager arms , and the two combatants , dripping and pale , were dragged up the bank , and lay panting upon the grass.John Tranter was the first to come to himself , for although he had been longer in the water , he had done nothing during that fierce battle with the current . He staggered to his feet and looked down upon his rescuer , who had raised himself upon his elbow , and was smiling faintly at the buzz of congratulation and of praise which broke from the squires around him . `` I am much beholden to you , sir , '' said Tranter , though in no very friendly voice . `` Certes , I should have been in the river now but for you , for I was born in Warwickshire , which is but a dry county , and there are few who swim in those parts . `` `` I ask no thanks , '' Alleyne answered shortly . `` Give me your hand to rise , Ford . `` `` The river has been my enemy , '' said Tranter , `` but it hath been a good friend to you , for it has saved your life this day . `` `` That is as it may be , '' returned Alleyne . `` But all is now well over , '' quoth Harcomb , `` and no scath come of it , which is more than I had at one time hoped for . Our young friend here hath very fairly and honestly earned his right to be craftsman of the Honorable Guild of the Squires of Bordeaux . Here is your doublet , Tranter . `` `` Alas for my poor sword which lies at the bottom of the Garonne ! '' said the squire . `` Here is your pourpoint , Edricson , '' cried Norbury . `` Throw it over your shoulders , that you may have at least one dry garment . `` `` And now away back to the abbey ! '' said several . `` One moment , sirs , '' cried Alleyne , who was leaning on Ford 's shoulder , with the broken sword , which he had picked up , still clutched in his right hand . `` My ears may be somewhat dulled by the water , and perchance what has been said has escaped me , but I have not yet heard this gentleman crave pardon for the insults which he put upon me in the hall. '' '' What ! do you still pursue the quarrel ? '' asked Tranter . `` And why not , sir ? I am slow to take up such things , but once afoot I shall follow it while I have life or breath . `` `` Ma foi ! you have not too much of either , for you are as white as marble , '' said Harcomb bluntly . `` Take my rede , sir , and let it drop , for you have come very well out from it . `` `` Nay , '' said Alleyne , `` this quarrel is none of my making ; but , now that I am here , I swear to you that I shall never leave this spot until I have that which I have come for : so ask my pardon , sir , or choose another glaive and to it again . `` The young squire was deadly white from his exertions , both on the land and in the water . Soaking and stained , with a smear of blood on his white shoulder and another on his brow , there was still in his whole pose and set of face the trace of an inflexible resolution . His opponent 's duller and more material mind quailed before the fire and intensity of a higher spiritual nature . `` I had not thought that you had taken it so amiss , '' said he awkwardly . `` It was but such a jest as we play upon each other , and , if you must have it so , I am sorry for it . `` `` Then I am sorry too , '' quoth Alleyne warmly , `` and here is my hand upon it . `` `` And the none-meat horn has blown three times , '' quoth Harcomb , as they all streamed in chattering groups from the ground . `` I know not what the prince 's maitre-de-cuisine will say or think . By my troth ! master Ford , your friend here is in need of a cup of wine , for he hath drunk deeply of Garonne water . I had not thought from his fair face that he had stood to this matter so shrewdly . `` `` Faith , '' said Ford , `` this air of Bordeaux hath turned our turtle-dove into a game-cock . A milder or more courteous youth never came out of Hampshire . `` `` His master also , as I understand , is a very mild and courteous gentleman , '' remarked Harcomb ; `` yet I do not think that they are either of them men with whom it is very safe to trifle . ``
