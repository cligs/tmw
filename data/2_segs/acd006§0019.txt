in all that he could while the panic lasted . Then , the original scare having proved to be all a mistake , the prices naturally go up once more , and we get a long figure for all that we hold . That 's what I mean by making 'a corner in diamonds . ' There is no room in it for any miscalculation . It is as certain as a proposition of Euclid , and as easily worked out . `` `` It sounds very nice , '' his son remarked thoughtfully . `` I 'm not so sure about its working , though . `` `` It must work well . As far as human calculation can go there is no possibility of failure . Besides , my boy , never lose sight of the fact that we shall be speculating with other people 's money . We ourselves have nothing to lose , absolutely nothing . `` `` I am not likely to lose sight of it , '' said Ezra angrily , his mind coming back to his grievance . `` I reckon that we can raise from forty to fifty thousand pounds without much difficulty . My name is , as you know , as good as that of any firm in the City . For nearly forty years it has been above stain or suspicion . If we carry on our plans at once , and lay this money out judiciously , all may come right . `` `` It 's Hobson 's choice , '' the young man remarked . `` We must try some boldstroke of the sort . Have you chosen the right sort of men for agents ? You should have men of some standing to set such reports going.They would have more weight then . `` John Girdlestone shook his head despondingly . `` How am I to get a man of any standing to do such a piece of business ? '' he said . `` Nothing easier , '' answered Ezra , with a cynical laugh . `` I could pick out a score of impecunious fellows from the clubs who would be only too glad to earn a hundred or two in any way you can mention . All their talk about honour and so forth is very pretty and edifying , but it 's not meant for every day use . Of course we should have to pay him . `` `` Them , you mean ? `` `` No , we should only want one man . `` `` How about our purchaser at the diamond fields ? `` `` You do n't mean to say , '' Ezra said roughly , `` that you would be so absurd as to trust any man with our money . Why , I would n't let the Archbishop of Canterbury out of my sight with forty thousand pounds of mine . No , I shall go myself to the diamond fields -- -that is , if I can trust you here alone . `` `` That is unkind , Ezra , '' said his father . `` Your idea is an excellent one . I should have proposed it myself but for the discomforts and hardships of such a journey . `` `` There 's no use doing things by halves , '' the young man remarked . `` As to our other agent , I have the very man -- -Major Tobias Clutterbuck . He is a shrewd , clever fellow , and he 's always hard up . Last week he wanted to borrow a tenner from me . The job would be a godsend to him , and his social rank would be a great help to our plan . I 'll answer for his jumping at the idea . `` `` Sound him on the subject , then . `` `` I will . `` `` I am glad , '' said the old merchant , `` that you and I have had this conversation , Ezra . The fact of my having speculated without your knowledge , and deceived you by a false ledger , has often weighed heavily upon my conscience , I assure you . It is a relief to me to have told you all . `` `` Drop the subject , then , '' Ezra said curtly . `` I must put up with it , for I have no redress . The thing is done and nothing can undo it ; but I consider that you have willfully wasted the money . `` `` Believe me , I have tried to act for the best . The good name of our firm is everything to me . I have spent my whole life in building it up , and if the day should come when it must go , I trust that I may have gone myself . There is nothing which I would not do to preserve it . `` `` I see they want our premiums , '' Ezra said , glancing at the open letter upon the table . `` How is it that none of those ships go down ? That would give us help. '' '' Hush ! hush ! '' John Girdlestone cried imploringly . `` Speak in a whisper when you talk of such things . `` `` I ca n't understand you , '' said Ezra petulantly . `` You persistently over-insure your ships , year after year . Look at theLeopard ; it is put at more than twice what she was worth as new . And theBlack Eagle , I dare say , is about the same . Yet you never have an accident with them , while your two new uninsured clippers run each other down . `` `` Well , what more can I do ? '' replied the merchant `` They are thoroughly rotten . I have done nothing for them for years . Sooner or later they must go . I can not do any more . `` `` I 'd make 'em go down quick enough , '' muttered Ezra , with an oath . `` Why do n't you make old Miggs bore a hole in them , or put a light to abarrel of paraffin ? Bless your soul ! the thing 's done every day.What 's the use of being milk-and-watery about it ? `` `` No , no , Ezra ! '' cried his father . `` Not that -- -not that . It 's one thing letting matters take their course , and it is another thing giving positive orders to scuttle a ship . Besides , it would put us in Miggs ' power . It would be too dangerous . `` `` Please yourself , '' said Ezra , with a sneer . `` You 've got us into the mess and you must take us out again . If the worst comes to the worst I 'll tell you what I 'll do . I 'll marry Kate Harston , wash my hands of the firm , leave you to settle matters with the creditors , and retire with the forty thousand pounds ; '' with which threat the junior partner took up his hat and swaggered out of the office.After his departure , John Girdlestone spent an hour in anxious thought , arranging the details of the scheme which he had just submitted to his son . As he sat , his eye chanced to fall upon the two letters lying on his desk , and it struck him that they had better be attended to . It did not suit his plans to fall back upon his credit just yet . It has been already shown that he was a man of ready resource . He rang the bell and summoned his senior clerk . `` Good morning , John , '' he said affably . `` Good morning , Mr. Girdlestone , good morning , sir , '' said wizened little John Gilray , rubbing his thin yellow hands together , as a sign of his gratification . `` I hear , John , that you have come into a legacy lately , '' Mr. Girdlestone said . `` Yes , sir . Fifteen hundred pounds , sir . Less legacy duty and incidental expenses , fourteen hundred and twenty-eight six and fourpence . My wife 's brother Andrew left it , sir , and a very handsome legacy too . `` John Girdlestone smiled with the indulgent smile of one to whom such a sum was absolutely nothing . `` What have you done with the money , then , John ? '' he asked carelessly . `` Banked it , sir , in the United Metropolitan . `` `` In the United Metropolitan , John ? Let me see . Their present rate of interest is three and a half ? `` `` Three , sir , '' said John. '' Three ! Dear me , John , that is poor interest , very poor indeed . It is most fortunate that I made these inquiries . I was on the point of drawing fourteen hundred pounds from one of my correspondents as a temporary convenience . For this I should pay him five per cent . I have no objection , John , as you are an old servant of the firm , to giving you the preference in this matter . I can not take more than fourteen hundred -- -but I shall be happy to accommodate you up to that sum at the rate named . `` John Gilray was overwhelmed by this thoughtful and considerate act . `` It is really too generous and kind , sir , '' he said . `` I do n't know how to thank you . `` `` Do n't mention it , John , '' the senior partner said grandly . `` The firm is always glad to advance the interests of its employees in any reasonable manner . Have you your cheque-book with you ? Fill it up for fourteen hundred . No more , John ; I can not oblige you by taking any more . `` The head clerk having made out his cheque for the amount , and having signed his name to it in a cramped little quaint handwriting , which reminded one of his person , was duly presented with a receipt and dismissed to his counting-house . There he entertained the other clerks by a glowing description of the magnanimity of his employer.John Girdlestone took some sheets of blue official paper from a drawer , and his quill pen travelled furiously over them with many a screech and splutter . `` Sir , '' he said to the bank manager , `` I enclose fourteen hundred pounds , which represents the loose cash about the office . I shall make a heavy deposit presently . In the meantime , you will , of course , honour anything that may be presented. -- -Yours truly , JOHN GIRDLESTONE . `` To Lloyd 's Insurance Agency he wrote : -- - '' Sir , -- -Enclosed you will find cheque for 241 pounds seven shillings and sixpence , being amount due as premium on theLeopard , Black Eagle , andMaid of Athens . Should have forwarded cheque before , but with so many things of importance to look after these trifles are liable to be overlooked . `` These two epistles having been sealed , addressed , and despatched , the elder Girdlestone began to feel somewhat more easy in his mind , and to devote himself once more to the innocent amusement of planning how a corner might best be created in diamonds.John Girdlestone 's private residence in Eccleston Square
