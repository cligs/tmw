north of us , '' he cried.The besieged looked at each other in dismay . The Iroquois had then cut off their retreat after all . `` How many warriors are in it ? '' asked the seigneur . `` I can not see . The light is not very good , and it is in the shadow of the bank . `` `` Which way is it coming ? `` `` It is coming this way . Ah , it shoots out into the open now , and I can see it . May the good Lord be praised ! A dozen candles shall burn in Quebec Cathedral if I live till next summer ! `` `` What is it then ? '' cried De la Noue impatiently . `` It is not an Iroquois canoe . There is but one man in it . He is aCanadian . `` `` A Canadian ! '' cried Du Lhut , springing up to the window . `` Who but a madman would venture into such a hornet 's nest alone ! Ah , yes , I can see him now . He keeps well out from the bank to avoid their fire . Now he is in mid-stream and he turns towards us . By my faith , it is not the first time that the good father has handled a paddle . `` `` It is a Jesuit ! '' said one , craning his neck . `` They are ever where there is most danger . `` `` No , I can see his capote , '' cried another . `` It is a Franciscan friar ! `` An instant later there was the sound of a canoe grounding upon the pebbles , the door was unbarred , and a man strode in , attired in the long brown gown of the Franciscans . He cast a rapid glance around , and then , stepping up to De Catinat , laid his hand upon his shoulder . `` So , you have not escaped me ! '' said he . `` We have caught the evil seed before it has had time to root . `` `` What do you mean , father ? '' asked the seigneur . `` You have made some mistake . This is my good friend Amory de Catinat , of a noble French family . `` `` This is Amory de Catinat , the heretic and Huguenot , '' cried the monk . `` I have followed him up the St. Lawrence , and I have followed him up theRichelieu , and I would have followed him to the world 's end if I couldbut bring him back with me . `` `` Tut , father , your zeal carries you too far , '' said the seigneur . `` Whither would you take my friend , then ? `` `` He shall go back to France with his wife . There is no place in Canada for heretics . `` Du Lhut burst out laughing . `` By Saint Anne , father , '' said he , `` if you could take us all back to France at present we should be very much your debtors . `` `` And you will remember , '' said De la Noue sternly , `` that you are under my roof and that you are speaking of my guest . `` But the friar was not to be abashed by the frown of the old nobleman . `` Look at this , '' said he , whipping a paper out of his bosom . `` It is signed by the governor , and calls upon you , under pain of the king 's displeasure , to return this man to Quebec . Ah , monsieur , when you left me upon the island that morning you little thought that I would return to Quebec for this , and then hunt you down so many hundreds of miles of river . But I have you now , and I shall never leave you until I see you on board the ship which will carry you and your wife back to France . `` For all the bitter vindictiveness which gleamed in the monk 's eyes , DeCatinat could not but admire the energy and tenacity of the man . `` It seems to me , father , that you would have shone more as a soldier than as a follower of Christ , '' said he ; `` but , since you have followed us here , and since there is no getting away , we may settle this question at some later time . `` But the two Americans were less inclined to take so peaceful a view . Ephraim Savage 's beard bristled with anger , and he whispered something into Amos Green 's ear . `` The captain and I could easily get rid of him , '' said the young woodsman , drawing De Catinat aside . `` If hewillcross our path he must pay for it . `` `` No , no , not for the world , Amos ! Let him alone . He does what he thinks to be his duty , though his faith is stronger than his charity , I think . But here comes the rain , and surely it is dark enough now for the boats . `` A great brown cloud had overspread the heavens , and the night had fallen so rapidly that they could hardly see the gleam of the river in front of them . The savages in the woods and behind the captured stockade were quiet , save for an occasional shot , but the yells and whoops from the cottages of thecensitairesshowed that they were being plundered by their captors . Suddenly a dull red glow began to show above one of the roofs . `` They have set it on fire , '' cried Du Lhut . `` The canoes must go at once , for the river will soon be as light as day . In ! In ! There is not an instant to lose ! `` There was no time for leave-taking . One impassioned kiss and Adele was torn away and thrust into the smallest canoe , which she shared with Onega , two children , and an unmarried girl . The others rushed into their places , and in a few moments they had pushed off , and had vanished into the drift and the darkness . The great cloud had broken and the rain pattered heavily upon the roof , and splashed upon their faces as they strained their eyes after the vanishing boats . `` Thank God for this storm ! '' murmured Du Lhut . `` It will prevent the cottages from blazing up too quickly . `` But he had forgotten that though the roofs might be wet the interior was as dry as tinder . He had hardly spoken before a great yellow tongue of flame licked out of one of the windows , and again and again , until suddenly half of the roof fell in , and the cottage was blazing like a pitch-bucket . The flames hissed and sputtered in the pouring rain , but , fed from below , they grew still higher and fiercer , flashing redly upon the great trees , and turning their trunks to burnished brass . Their light made the enclosure and the manor-house as clear as day , and exposed the whole long stretch of the river . A fearful yell from the woods announced that the savages had seen the canoes , which were plainly visible from the windows not more than a quarter of a mile away . `` They are rushing through the woods . They are making for the water 's edge , '' cried De Catinat . `` They have some canoes down there , '' said Du Lhut . `` But they must pass us ! '' cried the Seigneur of Sainte Marie . `` Get down to the cannon and see if you can not stop them . `` They had hardly reached the guns when two large canoes filled with warriors shot out from among the reeds below the fort , and steering out into mid-stream began to paddle furiously after the fugitives . `` Jean , you are our best shot , '' cried De la Noue . `` Lay for her as she passes the great pine tree . Lambert , do you take the other gun . The lives of all whom you love may hang upon the shot ! `` The two wrinkled old artillerymen glanced along their guns and waited for the canoes to come abreast of them . The fire still blazed higher and higher , and the broad river lay like a sheet of dull metal with two dark lines , which marked the canoes , sweeping swiftly down the centre . One was fifty yards in front of the other , but in each the Indians were bending to their paddles and pulling frantically , while their comrades from the wooded shores whooped them on to fresh exertions . The fugitives had already disappeared round the bend of the river.As the first canoe came abreast of the lower of the two guns , the Canadian made the sign of the cross over the touch-hole and fired . A cheer and then a groan went up from the eager watchers . The discharge had struck the surface close to the mark , and dashed such a shower of water over it that for an instant it looked as if it had been sunk . The next moment , however , the splash subsided , and the canoe shot away uninjured , save that one of the rowers had dropped his paddle while his head fell forward upon the back of the man in front of him . The second gunner sighted the same canoe as it came abreast of him , but at the very instant when he stretched out his match to fire a bullet came humming from the stockade and he fell forward dead without a groan . `` This is work that I know something of , lad , '' said old Ephraim , springing suddenly forward . `` But when I fire a gun I like to train it myself . Give me a help with the handspike and get her straight for the island . So ! A little lower for an even keel ! Now we have them ! '' He clapped down his match and fired.It was a beautiful shot . The whole charge took the canoe about six feet behind the bow , and doubled her up like an eggshell . Before the smoke had cleared she had foundered , and the second canoe had paused to pick up some of the wounded men . The others , as much at home in the water as in the woods , were already striking out for the shore. '' Quick ! Quick ! '' cried the seigneur . `` Load the gun ! We may get the second one yet ! `` But it was not to be . Long before they could get it ready the Iroquois had picked up their wounded warriors and were pulling madly up-stream once more . As they shot away the fire died suddenly down in the burning cottages and the rain and the darkness closed in upon them . `` My God ! '' cried De Catinat furiously , `` they will be taken . Let us abandon this place , take a boat , and follow them . Come ! Come ! Not an instant is to be lost ! `` `` Monsieur , you go too
