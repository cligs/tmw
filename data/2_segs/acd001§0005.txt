`` You are sure that there is no wound ? '' he asked , pointing to numerous gouts and splashes of blood which lay all round. '' Positive ! '' cried both detectives . `` Then , of course , this blood belongs to a second individual -- -8 presumably the murderer , if murder has been committed . It reminds me of the circumstances attendant on the death of Van Jansen , in Utrecht , in the year '34 . Do you remember the case , Gregson ? `` `` No , sir . `` `` Read it up -- -you really should . There is nothing new under the sun . It has all been done before . `` As he spoke , his nimble fingers were flying here , there , and everywhere , feeling , pressing , unbuttoning , examining , while his eyes wore the same far-away expression which I have already remarked upon . So swiftly was the examination made , that one would hardly have guessed the minuteness with which it was conducted . Finally , he sniffed the dead man 's lips , and then glanced at the soles of his patent leather boots . `` He has not been moved at all ? '' he asked . `` No more than was necessary for the purposes of our examination . `` `` You can take him to the mortuary now , '' he said . `` There is nothing more to be learned . `` Gregson had a stretcher and four men at hand . At his call they entered the room , and the stranger was lifted and carried out . As they raised him , a ring tinkled down and rolled across the floor . Lestrade grabbed it up and stared at it with mystified eyes . `` There 's been a woman here , '' he cried . `` It 's a woman 's wedding-ring . `` He held it out , as he spoke , upon the palm of his hand . We all gathered round him and gazed at it . There could be no doubt that that circlet of plain gold had once adorned the finger of a bride . `` This complicates matters , '' said Gregson . `` Heaven knows , they were complicated enough before . `` `` You 're sure it does n't simplify them ? '' observed Holmes . `` There 's nothing to be learned by staring at it . What did you find in his pockets ? `` `` We have it all here , '' said Gregson , pointing to a litter of objects upon one of the bottom steps of the stairs . `` A gold watch , No . 97163 , by Barraud , of London . Gold Albert chain , very heavy and solid . Gold ring , with masonic device . Gold pin -- -bull-dog 's head , with rubies as eyes . Russian leather card-case , with cards of Enoch J. Drebber of Cleveland , corresponding with the E. J. D. upon the linen . No purse , but loose money to the extent of seven pounds thirteen . Pocket edition of Boccaccio 's 'Decameron , ' with name of Joseph Stangerson upon the fly-leaf . Two letters -- -one addressed to E. J. Drebber and one to Joseph Stangerson . `` `` At what address ? `` `` American Exchange , Strand -- -to be left till called for . They are both from the Guion Steamship Company , and refer to the sailing of their boats from Liverpool . It is clear that this unfortunate man was about to return to New York . `` `` Have you made any inquiries as to this man , Stangerson ? `` `` I did it at once , sir , '' said Gregson . `` I have had advertisements sent to all the newspapers , and one of my men has gone to the American Exchange , but he has not returned yet . `` `` Have you sent to Cleveland ? `` `` We telegraphed this morning . `` `` How did you word your inquiries ? `` `` We simply detailed the circumstances , and said that we should be glad of any information which could help us . `` `` You did not ask for particulars on any point which appeared to you to be crucial ? `` `` I asked about Stangerson . `` `` Nothing else ? Is there no circumstance on which this whole case appears to hinge ? Will you not telegraph again ? `` `` I have said all I have to say , '' said Gregson , in an offended voice.Sherlock Holmes chuckled to himself , and appeared to be about to make some remark , when Lestrade , who had been in the front room while we were holding this conversation in the hall , reappeared upon the scene , rubbing his hands in a pompous and self-satisfied manner. '' Mr . Gregson , '' he said , `` I have just made a discovery of the highest importance , and one which would have been overlooked had I not made a careful examination of the walls . `` The little man 's eyes sparkled as he spoke , and he was evidently in a state of suppressed exultation at having scored a point against his colleague . `` Come here , '' he said , bustling back into the room , the atmosphere of which felt clearer since the removal of its ghastly inmate . `` Now , stand there ! `` He struck a match on his boot and held it up against the wall . `` Look at that ! '' he said , triumphantly.I have remarked that the paper had fallen away in parts . In this particular corner of the room a large piece had peeled off , leaving a yellow square of coarse plastering . Across this bare space there was scrawled in blood-red letters a single word -- - RACHE . `` What do you think of that ? '' cried the detective , with the air of a showman exhibiting his show . `` This was overlooked because it was in the darkest corner of the room , and no one thought of looking there . The murderer has written it with his or her own blood . See this smear where it has trickled down the wall ! That disposes of the idea of suicide anyhow . Why was that corner chosen to write it on ? I will tell you . See that candle on the mantelpiece . It was lit at the time , and if it was lit this corner would be the brightest instead of the darkest portion of the wall . `` `` And what does it mean now that youhavefound it ? '' asked Gregson in a depreciatory voice. '' Mean ? Why , it means that the writer was going to put the female name Rachel , but was disturbed before he or she had time to finish . You mark my words , when this case comes to be cleared up you will find that a woman named Rachel has something to do with it . It 's all very well for you to laugh , Mr. Sherlock Holmes . You may be very smart and clever , but the old hound is the best , when all is said and done . `` `` I really beg your pardon ! '' said my companion , who had ruffled the little man 's temper by bursting into an explosion of laughter . `` You certainly have the credit of being the first of us to find this out , and , as you say , it bears every mark of having been written by the other participant in last night 's mystery . I have not had time to examine this room yet , but with your permission I shall do so now . `` As he spoke , he whipped a tape measure and a large round magnifying glass from his pocket . With these two implements he trotted noiselessly about the room , sometimes stopping , occasionally kneeling , and once lying flat upon his face . So engrossed was he with his occupation that he appeared to have forgotten our presence , for he chattered away to himself under his breath the whole time , keeping up a running fire of exclamations , groans , whistles , and little cries suggestive of encouragement and of hope . As I watched him I was irresistibly reminded of a pure-blooded well-trained foxhound as it dashes backwards and forwards through the covert , whining in its eagerness , until it comes across the lost scent . For twenty minutes or more he continued his researches , measuring with the most exact care the distance between marks which were entirely invisible to me , and occasionally applying his tape to the walls in an equally incomprehensible manner . In one place he gathered up very carefully a little pile of grey dust from the floor , and packed it away in an envelope . Finally , he examined with his glass the word upon the wall , going over every letter of it with the most minute exactness . This done , he appeared to be satisfied , for he replaced his tape and his glass in his pocket . `` They say that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains , '' he remarked with a smile . `` It 's a very bad definition , but it does apply to detective work . `` Gregson and Lestrade had watched the manoeuvres 9 of their amateur companion with considerable curiosity and some contempt . They evidently failed to appreciate the fact , which I had begun to realize , that Sherlock Holmes ' smallest actions were all directed towards some definite and practical end . `` What do you think of it , sir ? '' they both asked . `` It would be robbing you of the credit of the case if I was to presume to help you , '' remarked my friend . `` You are doing so well now that it would be a pity for anyone to interfere . '' There was a world of sarcasm in his voice as he spoke . `` If you will let me know how your investigations go , '' he continued , `` I shall be happy to give you any help I can . In the meantime I should like to speak to the constable who found the body . Can you give me his name and address ? `` Lestrade glanced at his note-book . `` John Rance , '' he said . `` He is off duty now . You will find him at 46 , Audley Court , Kennington Park Gate . `` Holmes took a note of the address . `` Come along , Doctor , '' he said ; `` we shall go and look him up . I 'll tell you one thing which may help you in the case , '' he continued , turning to the two detectives . `` There has been murder done , and the murderer was a man . He was more than six feet high , was in the prime of life , had small feet for his height , wore coarse , square-toed boots and smoked a Trichinopoly cigar . He came here with his victim in a four-wheeled cab , which was drawn by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on his off fore leg . In all probability the murderer had a florid face , and the finger-nails of his right
