He 's a smart lad -- -very smart indeed -- -about as quick as they make 'em . He may be a trifle coarse at times , but that 's the spirit of the age , me dear sir . Me friend Tuffleton , of the Blues , says that delicacy went out of fashion with hair powder and beauty patches . he 's a demned satirical fellow is Tuffleton . Do n't know him , eh ? `` `` No , sir , I do n't , '' Girdlestone said angrily ; `` nor have I any desire to make his acquaintance . Let us proceed to business for my time is valuable . `` The major looked at him with an amiable smile . `` That quick temper runs in the family , '' he said . `` I 've noticed It in your son Ezra . As I said before , he 's a smart lad ; but me friend , he 's shockingly rash and extremely indiscrate . Ye musk speak to him about it . `` `` What do you mean sir ? '' asked the merchant , white with anger . `` Have you come to insult him in his absence ? '' '' Absence ? '' said the soldier , still smiling blandly over his stock . `` That 's the very point I wanted to get at . He is away in Africa -- -at the diamond fields . A wonderful interprise , conducted with remarkable energy , but also with remarkable rashness , sir -- -yes , bedad , inexcusable rashness . `` Old Girdlestone took up his heavy ebony ruler and played with it nervously . He had an overpowering desire to hurl it at the head of his companion . `` What would ye say , now , '' the veteran continued , crossing one leg over the other and arguing the matter out in a confidential undertone -- - `` what would you say if a young man came to you , and , on the assumption that you were a dishonest blackgaird , appealed to you to help him in a very shady sort of a scheme ? It would argue indiscretion on his part , would it not ? `` The merchant sat still , but grew whiter and whiter . `` And if on the top of that he gave you all the details of his schame , without even waiting to see if you favoured it or not , he would be more than indiscrate , would n't he ? Your own good sinse , me dear sir , will tell you that he would be culpably foolish -- -culpably so , bedad ! `` `` Well , sir ? '' said the old man , in a hoarse voice . `` Well , '' continued the major , `` I have no doubt that your son told you of the interesting little conversation that we had together . He was good enough to promise that if I went to Russia and pretinded to discover a fictitious mine , I should be liberally rewarded by the firm . I was under the necessity of pointing out to him that certain principles on which me family '' -- -here the major inflated his chest -- - '' on which me family are accustomed to act would prevint me from taking advantage of his offer . He then , I am sorry to say , lost his temper , and some words passed between us , the result of which was that we parted so rapidly that , be jabers ! I had hardly time to make him realize how great an indiscretion he had committed . `` The merchant still sat perfectly still , tapping the table with his black ebony ruler . `` Of course , afther hearing a skitch of the plan , '' continued the major , `` me curiosity was so aroused that I could not help following the details with intherest . I saw the gintleman who departed for Russia -- - Langworthy , I believe , was his name . Ged ! I knew a chap of that name in the Marines who used to drink raw brandy and cayenne pepper before breakfast every morning . Did ye ? Of course you could n't . What was I talking of at all at all ? `` Girdlestone stared gloomily at his visitor . The latter took a pinch of snuff from a tortoise-shell box , and flicked away a few wandering grains which settled upon the front of his coat . `` Yes , '' he went on , I saw Langworthy off to Russia . Then I saw your son start for Africa . He 's an interprising lad , and sure to do well there.coelum non animam mutant , as we used to say at Clongowes . He 'll always come to the front , wherever he is , as long as he avoids little slips like this one we 're spaking of . About the same time I heard that Girdlestone & Co , had raised riddy money to the extint of five and thirty thousand pounds . That 's gone to Africa , too , I presume . It 's a lot o ' money to invist in such a game , and it might be safe if you were the only people that knew about it , but whin there are others -- - '' '' Others ? `` `` Why , me , of course , '' said the major . `` I know about it , and more be token I am not in the swim with you . Sure , I could go this very evening to the diamond merchants about town and give them a tip about the coming fall in prices that would rather astonish 'em . `` `` Look here , Major Clutterbuck , '' cried the merchant , in a voice which quivered with suppressed passion , `` you have come into possession of an important commercial secret . Why beat about the bush any longer ? What is the object of your visit to-day ? What is it that you want ? `` `` There now ! '' the major said , addressing himself and smiling more amicably than ever . `` That 's business . Bedad , there 's where you commercial men have the pull . You go straight to the point and stick there . Ah , when I look at ye , I ca n't help thinking of your son . The same intelligent eye , the same cheery expression , the same devil-may-care manner and dry humour -- - '' '' Answer my question , will you ? '' the merchant interrupted savagely . `` And the same hasty timper , '' continued the major imperturbably . `` I 've forgotten , me dear sir , what it was you asked me . `` `` What is it you want ? `` `` Ah , yes , of course . What is it I want ? '' the old soldier said meditatively . `` Some would say more , some less . Some would want half , but that is overdoing it . How does a thousand pound stroike you ? Yes , I think we may put it at a thousand pounds . `` `` You want a thousand pounds ? `` `` Ged , I 've been wanting it all me life . The difference is that I 'm going to git it now . `` `` And for what ? `` `` Sure , for silence -- -for neutrality . We 're all in it now , and there 's afair division of labour . You plan , your son works , I hold me tongue.You make your tens of thousands , I make my modest little thousand.We all git paid for our throuble . `` `` And suppose I refuse ? '' '' Ah ! but you would n't -- -you could n't , '' the major said suavely . `` Ged , sir , I have n't known ye long , but I have far too high an opinion of ye to suppose ye could do anything so foolish . If you refuse , your speculation is thrown away . There 's no help for it . Bedad , it would be painful for me to have to blow the gaff ; but you know the old saying , that 'charity begins at home . ' You must sell your knowledge at the best market . `` Girdlestone thought intently for a minute or two , with his great eyebrows drawn down over his little restless eyes . `` You said to my son , '' he remarked at last , `` that you were too honourable to embark in our undertaking . Do you consider it honourable to make use of knowledge gained in confidence for the purpose of extorting money ? `` `` Me dear sir , '' answered the major , holding up his hand deprecatingly , `` you put me in the painful position of having to explain meself in plain words . If I saw a man about to do a murther , I should think nothing of murthering him . If I saw a pickpocket at work , I 'd pick his pocket , and think it good fun to do it . Now , this little business of yours is -- - well , we 'll say unusual , and if what I do seems a little unusual too , it 's to be excused . Ye ca n't throw stones at every one , me boy , and then be surprised when some one throws one at you . You bite the diamond holders , d 'ye see , and I take a little nibble at you . It 's all fair enough . `` The merchant reflected again for some moments . `` Suppose we agree to purchasing your silence at this price , '' he said , `` what guarantee have we that you will not come and extort more money , or that you may not betray our secret after all ? `` `` The honour of a soldier and a gintleman , '' answered the major , rising and tapping his chest with two fingers of his right hand.A slight sneer played over Girdlestone 's pale face , but he made no remark . `` We are in your power , '' he said , and have no resource but to submit to your terms . You said five hundred pounds ? `` `` A thousand , '' the major answered cheerfully . `` It 's a great sum of money . `` `` Deuce of a lot ! '' said the veteran cordially . `` Well , you shall have it . I will communicate with you . '' Girdlestone rose as if to terminate the interview.The major made no remark , but he showed his white teeth again , and tapped Mr. Girdlestone 's cheque-book with the silver head of his walking-stick. '' What ! Now ? `` `` Yes , now . `` The two looked at each other for a moment and the merchant sat down again and scribbled out a cheque , which he tossed to his companion . The latter looked it over carefully , took a fat little pocket-book from the depths of his breast pocket , and having placed the precious slip of paper in it , laboriously pushed it back into its receptacle . Then he very slowly and methodically picked up his jaunty curly-brimmed hat and shining kid gloves , and with a cheery nod to his companion , who answered it with a
