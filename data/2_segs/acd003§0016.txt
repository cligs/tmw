I come here to see a gentleman , and you two , who I never saw in my life , seize me and treat me in this fashion ! `` `` You will be none the worse , '' I said . `` We shall recompense you for the loss of your time . Sit over here on the sofa , and you will not have long to wait . `` He came across sullenly enough , and seated himself with his face resting on his hands . Jones and I resumed our cigars and our talk . Suddenly , however , Holmes 's voice broke in upon us . `` I think that you might offer me a cigar too , '' he said.We both started in our chairs . There was Holmes sitting close to us with an air of quiet amusement. '' Holmes ! '' I exclaimed . `` You here ! But where is the old man ? `` `` Here is the old man , '' said he , holding out a heap of white hair . `` Here he is , -- -wig , whiskers , eyebrows , and all . I thought my disguise was pretty good , but I hardly expected that it would stand that test . `` `` Ah , You rogue ! '' cried Jones , highly delighted . `` You would have made an actor , and a rare one . You had the proper workhouse cough , and those weak legs of yours are worth ten pound a week . I thought I knew the glint of your eye , though . You did n't get away from us so easily , You see . `` `` I have been working in that get-up all day , '' said he , lighting his cigar . `` You see , a good many of the criminal classes begin to know me , -- -especially since our friend here took to publishing some of my cases : so I can only go on the war-path under some simple disguise like this . You got my wire ? `` `` Yes ; that was what brought me here . `` `` How has your case prospered ? `` `` It has all come to nothing . I have had to release two of my prisoners , and there is no evidence against the other two . `` `` Never mind . We shall give you two others in the place of them . But you must put yourself under my orders . You are welcome to all the official credit , but you must act on the line that I point out . Is that agreed ? `` `` Entirely , if you will help me to the men . `` `` Well , then , in the first place I shall want a fast police-boat -- -a steam launch -- -to be at the Westminster Stairs at seven o'clock . `` `` That is easily managed . There is always one about there ; but I can step across the road and telephone to make sure . `` `` Then I shall want two stanch men , in case of resistance . `` `` There will be two or three in the boat . What else ? `` `` When we secure the men we shall get the treasure . I think that it would be a pleasure to my friend here to take the box round to the young lady to whom half of it rightfully belongs . Let her be the first to open it. -- -Eh , Watson ? `` `` It would be a great pleasure to me . `` `` Rather an irregular proceeding , '' said Jones , shaking his head . `` However , the whole thing is irregular , and I suppose we must wink at it . The treasure must afterwards be handed over to the authorities until after the official investigation. '' '' Certainly . That is easily managed . One other point . I should much like to have a few details about this matter from the lips of Jonathan Small himself . You know I like to work the detail of my cases out . There is no objection to my having an unofficial interview with him , either here in my rooms or elsewhere , as long as he is efficiently guarded ? `` `` Well , you are master of the situation . I have had no proof yet of the existence of this Jonathan Small . However , if you can catch him I do n't see how I can refuse you an interview with him . `` `` That is understood , then ? '' '' Perfectly . Is there anything else ? `` `` Only that I insist upon your dining with us . It will be ready in half an hour . I have oysters and a brace of grouse , with something a little choice in white wines. -- -Watson , you have never yet recognized my merits as a housekeeper . `` Our meal was a merry one . Holmes could talk exceedingly well when he chose , and that night he did choose . He appeared to be in a state of nervous exaltation . I have never known him so brilliant . He spoke on a quick succession of subjects , -- -on miracle-plays , on medieval pottery , on Stradivarius violins , on the Buddhism of Ceylon , and on the war-ships of the future , -- -handling each as though he had made a special study of it . His bright humor marked the reaction from his black depression of the preceding days . Athelney Jones proved to be a sociable soul in his hours of relaxation , and faced his dinner with the air of a bon vivant . For myself , I felt elated at the thought that we were nearing the end of our task , and I caught something of Holmes 's gaiety . None of us alluded during dinner to the cause which had brought us together.When the cloth was cleared , Holmes glanced at his watch , and filled up three glasses with port . `` One bumper , '' said he , `` to the success of our little expedition . And now it is high time we were off . Have you a pistol , Watson ? `` `` I have my old service-revolver in my desk . `` `` You had best take it , then . It is well to be prepared . I see that the cab is at the door . I ordered it for half-past six . `` It was a little past seven before we reached the Westminster wharf , and found our launch awaiting us . Holmes eyed it critically . `` Is there anything to mark it as a police-boat ? `` `` Yes , -- -that green lamp at the side . `` `` Then take it off . `` The small change was made , we stepped on board , and the ropes were cast off . Jones , Holmes , and I sat in the stern . There was one man at the rudder , one to tend the engines , and two burly police-inspectors forward . `` Where to ? '' asked Jones . `` To the Tower . Tell them to stop opposite Jacobson 's Yard . `` Our craft was evidently a very fast one . We shot past the long lines of loaded barges as though they were stationary . Holmes smiled with satisfaction as we overhauled a river steamer and left her behind us . `` We ought to be able to catch anything on the river , '' he said . `` Well , hardly that . But there are not many launches to beat us . `` `` We shall have to catch the Aurora , and she has a name for being a clipper . I will tell you how the land lies , Watson . You recollect how annoyed I was at being balked by so small a thing ? '' '' Yes . `` `` Well , I gave my mind a thorough rest by plunging into a chemical analysis . One of our greatest statesmen has said that a change of work is the best rest . So it is . When I had succeeded in dissolving the hydrocarbon which I was at work at , I came back to our problem of the Sholtos , and thought the whole matter out again . My boys had been up the river and down the river without result . The launch was not at any landing-stage or wharf , nor had it returned . Yet it could hardly have been scuttled to hide their traces , -- -though that always remained as a possible hypothesis if all else failed . I knew this man Small had a certain degree of low cunning , but I did not think him capable of anything in the nature of delicate finesse . That is usually a product of higher education . I then reflected that since he had certainly been in London some time -- -as we had evidence that he maintained a continual watch over Pondicherry Lodge -- -he could hardly leave at a moment 's notice , but would need some little time , if it were only a day , to arrange his affairs . That was the balance of probability , at any rate . `` `` It seems to me to be a little weak , '' said I . `` It is more probable that he had arranged his affairs before ever he set out upon his expedition . `` `` No , I hardly think so . This lair of his would be too valuable a retreat in case of need for him to give it up until he was sure that he could do without it . But a second consideration struck me . Jonathan Small must have felt that the peculiar appearance of his companion , however much he may have top-coated him , would give rise to gossip , and possibly be associated with this Norwood tragedy . He was quite sharp enough to see that . They had started from their head-quarters under cover of darkness , and he would wish to get back before it was broad light . Now , it was past three o'clock , according to Mrs. Smith , when they got the boat . It would be quite bright , and people would be about in an hour or so . Therefore , I argued , they did not go very far . They paid Smith well to hold his tongue , reserved his launch for the final escape , and hurried to their lodgings with the treasure-box . In a couple of nights , when they had time to see what view the papers took , and whether there was any suspicion , they would make their way under cover of darkness to some ship at Gravesend or in the Downs , where no doubt they had already arranged for passages to America or the Colonies . `` `` But the launch ? They could not have taken that to their lodgings . `` `` Quite so . I argued that the launch must be no great way off , in spite of its invisibility . I then put myself in the place of Small , and looked at it as a man of his capacity would . He would probably consider that to send back the launch or to keep it at a wharf would make pursuit easy if the police did happen to get on his track . How ,
