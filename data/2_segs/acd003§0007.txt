have waited to hear from him , for he often likes to be alone ; but an hour ago I feared that something was amiss , so I went up and peeped through the key-hole . You must go up , Mr. Thaddeus , -- -you must go up and look for yourself . I have seen Mr. Bartholomew Sholto in joy and in sorrow for ten long years , but I never saw him with such a face on him as that . `` Sherlock Holmes took the lamp and led the way , for Thaddeus Sholto 's teeth were chattering in his head . So shaken was he that I had to pass my hand under his arm as we went up the stairs , for his knees were trembling under him . Twice as we ascended Holmes whipped his lens out of his pocket and carefully examined marks which appeared to me to be mere shapeless smudges of dust upon the cocoa-nut matting which served as a stair-carpet . He walked slowly from step to step , holding the lamp , and shooting keen glances to right and left . Miss Morstan had remained behind with the frightened housekeeper.The third flight of stairs ended in a straight passage of some length , with a great picture in Indian tapestry upon the right of it and three doors upon the left . Holmes advanced along it in the same slow and methodical way , while we kept close at his heels , with our long black shadows streaming backwards down the corridor . The third door was that which we were seeking . Holmes knocked without receiving any answer , and then tried to turn the handle and force it open . It was locked on the inside , however , and by a broad and powerful bolt , as we could see when we set our lamp up against it . The key being turned , however , the hole was not entirely closed . Sherlock Holmes bent down to it , and instantly rose again with a sharp intaking of the breath . `` There is something devilish in this , Watson , '' said he , more moved than I had ever before seen him . `` What do you make of it ? `` I stooped to the hole , and recoiled in horror . Moonlight was streaming into the room , and it was bright with a vague and shifty radiance . Looking straight at me , and suspended , as it were , in the air , for all beneath was in shadow , there hung a face , -- -the very face of our companion Thaddeus . There was the same high , shining head , the same circular bristle of red hair , the same bloodless countenance . The features were set , however , in a horrible smile , a fixed and unnatural grin , which in that still and moonlit room was more jarring to the nerves than any scowl or contortion . So like was the face to that of our little friend that I looked round at him to make sure that he was indeed with us . Then I recalled to mind that he had mentioned to us that his brother and he were twins . `` This is terrible ! '' I said to Holmes . `` What is to be done ? `` `` The door must come down , '' he answered , and , springing against it , he put all his weight upon the lock . It creaked and groaned , but did not yield . Together we flung ourselves upon it once more , and this time it gave way with a sudden snap , and we found ourselves within Bartholomew Sholto 's chamber.It appeared to have been fitted up as a chemical laboratory . A double line of glass-stoppered bottles was drawn up upon the wall opposite the door , and the table was littered over with Bunsen burners , test-tubes , and retorts . In the corners stood carboys of acid in wicker baskets . One of these appeared to leak or to have been broken , for a stream of dark-colored liquid had trickled out from it , and the air was heavy with a peculiarly pungent , tar-like odor . A set of steps stood at one side of the room , in the midst of a litter of lath and plaster , and above them there was an opening in the ceiling large enough for a man to pass through . At the foot of the steps a long coil of rope was thrown carelessly together.By the table , in a wooden arm-chair , the master of the house was seated all in a heap , with his head sunk upon his left shoulder , and that ghastly , inscrutable smile upon his face . He was stiff and cold , and had clearly been dead many hours . It seemed to me that not only his features but all his limbs were twisted and turned in the most fantastic fashion . By his hand upon the table there lay a peculiar instrument , -- -a brown , close-grained stick , with a stone head like a hammer , rudely lashed on with coarse twine . Beside it was a torn sheet of note-paper with some words scrawled upon it . Holmes glanced at it , and then handed it to me . `` You see , '' he said , with a significant raising of the eyebrows.In the light of the lantern I read , with a thrill of horror , `` The sign of the four . `` `` In God 's name , what does it all mean ? '' I asked . `` It means murder , '' said he , stooping over the dead man . `` Ah , I expected it . Look here ! '' He pointed to what looked like a long , dark thorn stuck in the skin just above the ear . `` It looks like a thorn , '' said I . `` It is a thorn . You may pick it out . But be careful , for it is poisoned . `` I took it up between my finger and thumb . It came away from the skin so readily that hardly any mark was left behind . One tiny speck of blood showed where the puncture had been . `` This is all an insoluble mystery to me , '' said I . `` It grows darker instead of clearer . `` `` On the contrary , '' he answered , `` it clears every instant . I only require a few missing links to have an entirely connected case . `` We had almost forgotten our companion 's presence since we entered the chamber . He was still standing in the door-way , the very picture of terror , wringing his hands and moaning to himself . Suddenly , however , he broke out into a sharp , querulous cry . `` The treasure is gone ! '' he said . `` They have robbed him of the treasure ! There is the hole through which we lowered it . I helped him to do it ! I was the last person who saw him ! I left him here last night , and I heard him lock the door as I came down-stairs . `` `` What time was that ? `` `` It was ten o'clock . And now he is dead , and the police will be called in , and I shall be suspected of having had a hand in it . Oh , yes , I am sure I shall . But you do n't think so , gentlemen ? Surely you do n't think that it was I ? Is it likely that I would have brought you here if it were I ? Oh , dear ! oh , dear ! I know that I shall go mad ! '' He jerked his arms and stamped his feet in a kind of convulsive frenzy . `` You have no reason for fear , Mr. Sholto , '' said Holmes , kindly , putting his hand upon his shoulder . `` Take my advice , and drive down to the station to report this matter to the police . Offer to assist them in every way . We shall wait here until your return . `` The little man obeyed in a half-stupefied fashion , and we heard him stumbling down the stairs in the dark . `` Now , Watson , '' said Holmes , rubbing his hands , `` we have half an hour to ourselves . Let us make good use of it . My case is , as I have told you , almost complete ; but we must not err on the side of over-confidence . Simple as the case seems now , there may be something deeper underlying it. '' '' Simple ! '' I ejaculated . `` Surely , '' said he , with something of the air of a clinical professor expounding to his class . `` Just sit in the corner there , that your footprints may not complicate matters . Now to work ! In the first place , how did these folk come , and how did they go ? The door has not been opened since last night . How of the window ? '' He carried the lamp across to it , muttering his observations aloud the while , but addressing them to himself rather than to me . `` Window is snibbed on the inner side . Framework is solid . No hinges at the side . Let us open it . No water-pipe near . Roof quite out of reach . Yet a man has mounted by the window . It rained a little last night . Here is the print of a foot in mould upon the sill . And here is a circular muddy mark , and here again upon the floor , and here again by the table . See here , Watson ! This is really a very pretty demonstration . `` I looked at the round , well-defined muddy discs . `` This is not a footmark , '' said I . `` It is something much more valuable to us . It is the impression of a wooden stump . You see here on the sill is the boot-mark , a heavy boot with the broad metal heel , and beside it is the mark of the timber-toe . `` `` It is the wooden-legged man . `` `` Quite so . But there has been some one else , -- -a very able and efficient ally . Could you scale that wall , doctor ? `` I looked out of the open window . The moon still shone brightly on that angle of the house . We were a good sixty feet from the ground , and , look where I would , I could see no foothold , nor as much as a crevice in the brick-work . `` It is absolutely impossible , '' I answered . `` Without aid it is so . But suppose you had a friend up here who lowered you this good stout rope which I see in the corner , securing one end of it to this great hook in the wall . Then , I think , if you were an active man , You might swarm up , wooden leg and all . You would depart , of course , in the same fashion , and your ally would draw up the rope , untie it from the hook , shut
