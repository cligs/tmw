honour us with a visit himself ? `` `` He can not leave town at present . He has other cases which engage his attention . `` `` What a pity ! He might throw some light on that which is so dark to us . But as to your own researches , if there is any possible way in which I can be of service to you I trust that you will command me . If I had any indication of the nature of your suspicions or how you propose to investigate the case , I might perhaps even now give you some aid or advice . `` `` I assure you that I am simply here upon a visit to my friend , Sir Henry , and that I need no help of any kind. '' '' Excellent ! '' said Stapleton . `` You are perfectly right to be wary and discreet . I am justly reproved for what I feel was an unjustifiable intrusion , and I promise you that I will not mention the matter again . `` We had come to a point where a narrow grassy path struck off from the road and wound away across the moor . A steep , boulder-sprinkled hill lay upon the right which had in bygone days been cut into a granite quarry . The face which was turned towards us formed a dark cliff , with ferns and brambles growing in its niches . From over a distant rise there floated a gray plume of smoke . `` A moderate walk along this moor-path brings us to Merripit House , '' said he . `` Perhaps you will spare an hour that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to my sister . `` My first thought was that I should be by Sir Henry 's side . But then I remembered the pile of papers and bills with which his study table was littered . It was certain that I could not help with those . And Holmes had expressly said that I should study the neighbours upon the moor . I accepted Stapleton 's invitation , and we turned together down the path . `` It is a wonderful place , the moor , '' said he , looking round over the undulating downs , long green rollers , with crests of jagged granite foaming up into fantastic surges . `` You never tire of the moor . You can not think the wonderful secrets which it contains . It is so vast , and so barren , and so mysterious . `` `` You know it well , then ? `` `` I have only been here two years . The residents would call me a newcomer . We came shortly after Sir Charles settled . But my tastes led me to explore every part of the country round , and I should think that there are few men who know it better than I do . `` `` Is it hard to know ? `` `` Very hard . You see , for example , this great plain to the north here with the queer hills breaking out of it . Do you observe anything remarkable about that ? `` `` It would be a rare place for a gallop . `` `` You would naturally think so and the thought has cost several their lives before now . You notice those bright green spots scattered thickly over it ? `` `` Yes , they seem more fertile than the rest . `` Stapleton laughed . `` That is the great Grimpen Mire , '' said he . `` A false step yonder means death to man or beast . Only yesterday I saw one of the moor ponies wander into it . He never came out . I saw his head for quite a long time craning out of the bog-hole , but it sucked him down at last . Even in dry seasons it is a danger to cross it , but after these autumn rains it is an awful place . And yet I can find my way to the very heart of it and return alive . By George , there is another of those miserable ponies ! `` Something brown was rolling and tossing among the green sedges . Then a long , agonized , writhing neck shot upward and a dreadful cry echoed over the moor . It turned me cold with horror , but my companion 's nerves seemed to be stronger than mine . `` It 's gone ! '' said he . `` The mire has him . Two in two days , and many more , perhaps , for they get in the way of going there in the dry weather and never know the difference until the mire has them in its clutches . It 's a bad place , the great Grimpen Mire . `` `` And you say you can penetrate it ? `` `` Yes , there are one or two paths which a very active man can take . I have found them out . `` `` But why should you wish to go into so horrible a place ? `` `` Well , you see the hills beyond ? They are really islands cut off on all sides by the impassable mire , which has crawled round them in the course of years . That is where the rare plants and the butterflies are , if you have the wit to reach them . `` `` I shall try my luck some day . `` He looked at me with a surprised face . `` For God 's sake put such an idea out of your mind , '' said he . `` Your blood would be upon my head . I assure you that there would not be the least chance of your coming back alive . It is only by remembering certain complex landmarks that I am able to do it. '' '' Halloa ! '' I cried . `` What is that ? `` A long , low moan , indescribably sad , swept over the moor . It filled the whole air , and yet it was impossible to say whence it came . From a dull murmur it swelled into a deep roar , and then sank back into a melancholy , throbbing murmur once again . Stapleton looked at me with a curious expression in his face . `` Queer place , the moor ! '' said he . `` But what is it ? `` `` The peasants say it is the Hound of the Baskervilles calling for its prey . I 've heard it once or twice before , but never quite so loud . `` I looked round , with a chill of fear in my heart , at the huge swelling plain , mottled with the green patches of rushes . Nothing stirred over the vast expanse save a pair of ravens , which croaked loudly from a tor behind us . `` You are an educated man . You do n't believe such nonsense as that ? '' said I . `` What do you think is the cause of so strange a sound ? `` `` Bogs make queer noises sometimes . It 's the mud settling , or the water rising , or something . `` `` No , no , that was a living voice . `` `` Well , perhaps it was . Did you ever hear a bittern booming ? `` `` No , I never did . `` `` It 's a very rare bird -- -practically extinct -- -in England now , but all things are possible upon the moor . Yes , I should not be surprised to learn that what we have heard is the cry of the last of the bitterns . `` `` It 's the weirdest , strangest thing that ever I heard in my life . `` `` Yes , it 's rather an uncanny place altogether . Look at the hillside yonder . What do you make of those ? `` The whole steep slope was covered with gray circular rings of stone , a score of them at least . `` What are they ? Sheep-pens ? `` `` No , they are the homes of our worthy ancestors . Prehistoric man lived thickly on the moor , and as no one in particular has lived there since , we find all his little arrangements exactly as he left them . These are his wigwams with the roofs off . You can even see his hearth and his couch if you have the curiosity to go inside . `` But it is quite a town . When was it inhabited ? `` `` Neolithic man -- -no date . `` `` What did he do ? `` `` He grazed his cattle on these slopes , and he learned to dig for tin when the bronze sword began to supersede the stone axe . Look at the great trench in the opposite hill . That is his mark . Yes , you will find some very singular points about the moor , Dr. Watson . Oh , excuse me an instant ! It is surely Cyclopides . `` A small fly or moth had fluttered across our path , and in an instant Stapleton was rushing with extraordinary energy and speed in pursuit of it . To my dismay the creature flew straight for the great mire , and my acquaintance never paused for an instant , bounding from tuft to tuft behind it , his green net waving in the air . His gray clothes and jerky , zigzag , irregular progress made him not unlike some huge moth himself . I was standing watching his pursuit with a mixture of admiration for his extraordinary activity and fear lest he should lose his footing in the treacherous mire , when I heard the sound of steps and , turning round , found a woman near me upon the path . She had come from the direction in which the plume of smoke indicated the position of Merripit House , but the dip of the moor had hid her until she was quite close.I could not doubt that this was the Miss Stapleton of whom I had been told , since ladies of any sort must be few upon the moor , and I remembered that I had heard someone describe her as being a beauty . The woman who approached me was certainly that , and of a most uncommon type . There could not have been a greater contrast between brother and sister , for Stapleton was neutral tinted , with light hair and gray eyes , while she was darker than any brunette whom I have seen in England -- -slim , elegant , and tall . She had a proud , finely cut face , so regular that it might have seemed impassive were it not for the sensitive mouth and the beautiful dark , eager eyes . With her perfect figure and elegant dress she was , indeed , a strange apparition upon a lonely moorland path . Her eyes were on her brother as I turned , and then she quickened her pace towards me . I had raised my hat and was about to make some explanatory remark when her own words turned all my thoughts into a new channel . `` Go back ! '' she said . `` Go straight back to London , instantly . `` I could only stare at her in stupid surprise . Her eyes blazed at me , and she tapped the ground impatiently with her foot . `` Why should I go back ?
