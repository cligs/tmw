their clenched hands waving , all drunk with bloodshed and with vengeance . A yell of execration and a scream of hideous laughter burst from the vast throng , as they saw the faces of the last survivors of their enemies peering down at them from the height of the keep . They still piled the brushwood round the base of the tower , and gambolled hand in hand around the blaze , screaming out the doggerel lines which had long been the watchword of the Jacquerie : Cessez , cessez , gens d'armes et pietons , De piller et manger le bonhomme Qui de longtemps Jacques Bonhomme Se nomme.Their thin , shrill voices rose high above the roar of the flames and the crash of the masonry , like the yelping of a pack of wolves who see their quarry before them and know that they have well-nigh run him down . `` By my hilt ! '' said Aylward to John , `` it is in my mind that we shall not see Spain this journey . It is a great joy to me that I have placed my feather-bed and other things of price with that worthy woman at Lyndhurst , who will now have the use of them . I have thirteen arrows yet , and if one of them fly unfleshed , then , by the twang of string ! I shall deserve my doom . First at him who flaunts with my lady 's silken frock . Clap in the clout , by God ! though a hand's-breadth lower than I had meant . Now for the rogue with the head upon his pike . Ha ! to the inch , John . When my eye is true , I am better at rovers than at long-butts or hoyles . A good shoot for you also , John ! The villain hath fallen forward into the fire . But I pray you , John , to loose gently , and not to pluck with the drawing-hand , for it is a trick that hath marred many a fine bowman . `` Whilst the two archers were keeping up a brisk fire upon the mob beneath them , Du Guesclin and his lady were consulting with Sir Nigel upon their desperate situation . `` 'T is a strange end for one who has seen so many stricken fields , '' said the French chieftain . `` For me one death is as another , but it is the thought of my sweet lady which goes to my heart . `` `` Nay , Bertrand , I fear it as little as you , '' said she . `` Had I my dearest wish , it would be that we should go together . `` `` Well answered , fair lady ! '' cried Sir Nigel . `` And very sure I am that my own sweet wife would have said the same . If the end be now come , I have had great good fortune in having lived in times when so much glory was to be won , and in knowing so many valiant gentlemen and knights . But why do you pluck my sleeve , Alleyne ? `` `` If it please you , my fair lord , there are in this corner two great tubes of iron , with many heavy balls , which may perchance be those bombards and shot of which I have heard . `` `` By Saint Ives ! it is true , '' cried Sir Bertrand , striding across to the recess where the ungainly , funnel-shaped , thick-ribbed engines were standing . `` Bombards they are , and of good size . We may shoot down upon them . `` `` Shoot with them , quotha ? '' cried Aylward in high disdain , for pressing danger is the great leveller of classes . `` How is a man to take aim with these fool 's toys , and how can he hope to do scath with them ? `` `` I will show you , '' answered Sir Nigel ; `` for here is the great box of powder , and if you will raise it for me , John , I will show you how it may be used . Come hither , where the folk are thickest round the fire . Now , Aylward , crane thy neck and see what would have been deemed an old wife 's tale when we first turned our faces to the wars . Throw back the lid , John , and drop the box into the fire ! `` A deafening roar , a fluff of bluish light , and the great square tower rocked and trembled from its very foundations , swaying this way and that like a reed in the wind . Amazed and dizzy , the defenders , clutching at the cracking parapets for support , saw great stones , burning beams of wood , and mangled bodies hurtling past them through the air . When they staggered to their feet once more , the whole keep had settled down upon one side , so that they could scarce keep their footing upon the sloping platform . Gazing over the edge , they looked down upon the horrible destruction which had been caused by the explosion . For forty yards round the portal the ground was black with writhing , screaming figures , who struggled up and hurled themselves down again , tossing this way and that , sightless , scorched , with fire bursting from their tattered clothing . Beyond this circle of death their comrades , bewildered and amazed , cowered away from this black tower and from these invincible men , who were most to be dreaded when hope was furthest from their hearts . `` A sally , Du Guesclin , a sally ! '' cried Sir Nigel . `` By Saint Paul ! they are in two minds , and a bold rush may turn them . '' He drew his sword as he spoke and darted down the winding stairs , closely followed by his four comrades . Ere he was at the first floor , however , he threw up his arms and stopped . `` Mon Dieu ! '' he said , `` we are lost men ! `` `` What then ? '' cried those behind him . `` The wall hath fallen in , the stair is blocked , and the fire still rages below . By Saint Paul ! friends , we have fought a very honorable fight , and may say in all humbleness that we have done our devoir , but I think that we may now go back to the Lady Tiphaine and say our orisons , for we have played our parts in this world , and it is time that we made ready for another . `` The narrow pass was blocked by huge stones littered in wild confusion over each other , with the blue choking smoke reeking up through the crevices . The explosion had blown in the wall and cut off the only path by which they could descend . Pent in , a hundred feet from earth , with a furnace raging under them and a ravening multitude all round who thirsted for their blood , it seemed indeed as though no men had ever come through such peril with their lives . Slowly they made their way back to the summit , but as they came out upon it the Lady Tiphaine darted forward and caught her husband by the wrist . `` Bertrand , '' said she , `` hush and listen ! I have heard the voices of men all singing together in a strange tongue . `` Breathless they stood and silent , but no sound came up to them , save the roar of the flames and the clamor of their enemies . `` It can not be , lady , '' said Du Guesclin . `` This night hath over wrought you , and your senses play you false . What men are there in this country who would sing in a strange tongue ? '' '' Hola ! '' yelled Aylward , leaping suddenly into the air with waving hands and joyous face . `` I thought I heard it ere we went down , and now I hear it again . We are saved , comrades ! By these ten finger-bones , we are saved ! It is the marching song of the White Company . Hush ! `` With upraised forefinger and slanting head , he stood listening . Suddenly there came swelling up a deep-voiced , rollicking chorus from somewhere out of the darkness . Never did choice or dainty ditty of Provence or Languedoc sound more sweetly in the ears than did the rough-tongued Saxon to the six who strained their ears from the blazing keep : We 'll drink all together To the gray goose feather And the land where the gray goose flew . `` Ha , by my hilt ! '' shouted Aylward , `` it is the dear old bow song of the Company . Here come two hundred as tight lads as ever twirled a shaft over their thumbnails . Hark to the dogs , how lustily they sing ! `` Nearer and clearer , swelling up out of the night , came the gay marching lilt : What of the bow ? The bow was made in England . Of true wood , of yew wood , The wood of English bows ; For men who are free Love the old yew-tree And the land where the yew tree grows . What of the men ? The men were bred in England , The bowmen , the yeomen , The lads of the dale and fell , Here 's to you and to you , To the hearts that are true , And the land where the true hearts dwell . `` They sing very joyfully , '' said Du Guesclin , `` as though they were going to a festival . `` `` It is their wont when there is work to be done . `` `` By Saint Paul ! '' quoth Sir Nigel , `` it is in my mind that they come too late , for I can not see how we are to come down from this tower . `` `` There they come , the hearts of gold ! '' cried Aylward . `` See , they move out from the shadow . Now they cross the meadow . They are on the further side of the moat . Hola camarades , hola ! Johnston , Eccles , Cooke , Harward , Bligh ! Would ye see a fair lady and two gallant knights done foully to death ? `` `` Who is there ? '' shouted a deep voice from below . `` Who is this who speaks with an English tongue ? `` `` It is I , old lad . It is Sam Aylward of the Company ; and here is your captain , Sir Nigel Loring , and four others , all laid out to be grilled like an Easterling 's herrings . `` `` Curse me if I did not think that it was the style of speech of old Samkin Aylward , '' said the voice , amid a buzz from the ranks . `` Wherever there are knocks going there is Sammy in the heart of it . But who are these ill-faced rogues who block the path ? To your kennels , canaille ! What ! you dare look us in the eyes ? Out swords , lads , and give them the flat of them ! Waste not your shafts
