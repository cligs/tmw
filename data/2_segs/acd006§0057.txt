do to prolong the struggle . As debts became due , he would still stave off each creditor with such skill and plausibility as allayed every suspicion . Day by day , however , the work became more severe , and he felt that he was propping up an edifice which was so rotten that it must , sooner or later , come crumbling about his ears . When he came down to the Priory upon the Saturday , the young man 's haggard and anxious face showed the severe ordeal which he had undergone.Kate had already retired to her room when he arrived . She heard the sound of the trap , however , and guessed who it was , even before his deep bass voice sounded in the room beneath . Looking out of her window a little later she saw him walking to and fro in the moonlight , talking earnestly to his father . It was a bitter night , and she wondered what they could have to talk about which might not be said beside the warm fire in the dining-room . They flickered up and down among the shadows for more than an hour , and then the girl heard the door slam , and shortly afterwards the heavy tread of the two men passed her chamber , and ascended to the rooms above.It was a momentous conversation which she had witnessed . In it Ezra had shown his father how impossible it was to keep up appearances , and how infallible was their ruin unless help came speedily . `` I do n't think any of them smell a rat , '' he said . `` Mortimer and Johnson pressed for their bill in rather an ugly manner , but I talked them over completely . I took out my cheque-book . 'Look here , gentlemen , ' said I , 'if you wish I shall write a cheque for the amount . If I do , it will be the last piece of business which we shall do together . A great house like ours ca n't afford to be disturbed in the routine of their business . ' They curled up at once , and said no more about it . It was an anxious moment though , for if they had taken my offer , the whole murder would have been out . `` The old man started at the word his son had used , and rubbed his hands together as though a sudden chill had struck through him . `` Do n't you think , Ezra , '' he said , clutching his son 's arm , `` that is a very foolish saying about 'murder will out ' ? I remember Pilkington , the detective , who was a member of our church when I used to worship at Durham Street , speaking on this subject . He said that it was his opinion that people are being continually made away with , and that not more than one in ten are ever accounted for . Nine chances to one , Ezra , and then those which are found out are very vulgar affairs . If a man of intellect gave his mind to it , there would be little chance of detection . How very cold the night is ! `` `` Yes , '' returned his son . `` It is best to talk of such things in the open air , though . How has all gone since you have been down here ? `` `` Very well . She was restive the first day , and wanted to get toBedsworth . I think that she has given it up now as a bad job.Stevens , the gatekeeper , is a very worthy fellow . `` `` What steps have you taken ? '' asked Ezra , striking a fusee and lighting a cigar . `` I have taken care that they should know that she is an invalid , both at Bedsworth and at Claxton . They have all heard of the poor sick young lady at the Priory . I have let them know also that her mind is a little strange , which accounts , of course , for her being kept in solitude . When it happens -- - '' '' For God 's sake , be quiet ! '' the young man cried , with a shudder . `` It 's an awful job ; it wo n't bear thinking of . `` `` Yes , it is a sad business ; but what else is there ? `` `` And how would you do it ? '' Ezra asked , in a hoarse whisper . `` No violence , I hope . `` `` It may come to that . I have other plans in my head , however , which may be tried first . I think that I see one way out of it which would simplify matters . `` `` If there is no alternative I have a man who is ripe for any job of the sort . `` `` Ah , who is that ? `` `` A fellow who can hit a good downright blow , as I can testify to my cost . His name is Burt . He is the man who cut my head open in Africa . I met him in London the other day , and spotted him at once . He is a half-starved , poor devil , and as desperate as a man could be . He is just in the key for any business of the sort . I 've got the whip-hand of him now , and he knows it , so that I could put him up to anything . I believe that such a job would be a positive pleasure to him , for the fellow is more like a wild beast than a man . `` `` Sad , sad ! '' Girdlestone exclaimed . `` If a man once falls away , what is there to separate him from the beasts ? How can I find this man ? `` `` Wire to me . Put 'Send a doctor ; ' that will do as well as anything else , and will sound well at the post-office . I 'll see that he comes down by the next train . You 'd best meet him at the station , for the chances are that he will be drunk . `` `` Bring him down , '' said Girdlestone . `` You must be here yourself . `` `` Surely you can do without me ? `` `` No , no . We must stand or fall together . `` `` I 've a good mind to throw the thing over , '' said Ezra , stopping in his walk . `` It sickens me. '' '' What ! Go back now ! '' the old man cried vehemently . `` No , no , that would be too craven . We have everything in our favour , and all that we want is a stout heart . Oh , my boy , my boy , on the one side of you are ruin , dishonour , a sordid existence , and the scorn of your old companions ; on the other are success and riches and fame and all that can make life pleasant . You know as well as I do that the girl 's money would turn the scale , and that all would then be well . Your whole future depends upon her death . We have given her every chance . She laughed at your love . It is time now to show her your hate . `` `` That is true enough , '' Ezra said , walking on . `` There is no reason why I should pity her . I 've put my hand to the plough , and I shall go on . I seem to be getting into your infernal knack of scripture quoting . `` `` There is a brave , good lad , '' cried his father . `` It would not do to draw back now . `` `` You will find Rebecca useful , '' the young man said , `` You may trust her entirely . `` `` You did well to send her . Have they asked for me much ? '' '' Yes . I have told them all the same story -- -nervous exhaustion , and doctor 's orders that you were not to be disturbed by any business letters . The only man who seemed to smell a rat was that young Dimsdale. '' '' Ah ! '' cried the old man , with a chuckle ; `` of course he would be surprised at our disappearance . `` `` He looks like a madman ; asked me where you had gone , and when I answered him as I had the others , stormed out that he had a right to know , and that he would know . His blood was up , and there was nearly being a pretty scene before the clerks . He follows me home every evening to Eccleston Square , and waits outside half the night through to see that I do not leave the house . `` `` Does he , though ? `` `` Yes ; he came after me to the station to-day . He had a cravat round his mouth and an ulster , but I could see that it was he . I took a ticket for Colchester . He took one also , and made for the Colchester train . I gave him the slip , got the right ticket , and came on . I 've no doubt he is at Colchester at this moment . `` `` Remember , my boy , '' the merchant said , as they turned from the door , `` this is the last of our trials . If we succeed in this , all is well for the future . `` `` We have tried diamonds , and we have tried marriage . The third time is the charm , '' said Ezra , as he threw away his cigar and followed his father.Ezra Girdlestone hardly went through the formality of greeting Kate next morning when she came down to breakfast . He was evidently ill at ease , and turned away his eyes when she looked at him , though he glanced at her furtively from time to time . His father chatted with him upon City matters , but the young man 's answers were brusque and monosyllabic . His sleep had been troubled and broken , for the conversation of the night before had obtruded unpleasantly on his dreams.Kate slipped away from them as soon as she could and , putting on her bonnet , went for a long walk through the grounds , partly for the sake of exercise , and partly in the hope of finding some egress . The one-eyed gate-keeper was at his post , and set up a hideous shout of laughter when he saw her ; so she branched off among the trees to avoid him , and walked once more very carefully round the boundary wall . It was no easy matter to follow it continuously , for the briars and brambles grew in a confused tangle up to its very base . By perseverance , however , she succeeded in tracing every foot of it , and so satisfying herself finally that there was no diminution anywhere in its height , no break in its continuity , save the one small wooden door which was securely fastened.There was one spot , however , where a gleam of hope presented
