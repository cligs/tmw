would it be were your prayer to be answered ? `` `` The use of my own salvation . `` She turned from him with a pretty shrug and wave . `` Is that all ? '' she said . `` Then you are no better than Father Christopher and the rest of them . Your own , your own , ever your own ! My father is the king 's man , and when he rides into the press of fight he is not thinking ever of the saving of his own poor body ; he recks little enough if he leave it on the field . Why then should you , who are soldiers of the Spirit , be ever moping or hiding in cell or in cave , with minds full of your own concerns , while the world , which you should be mending , is going on its way , and neither sees nor hears you ? Were ye all as thoughtless of your own souls as the soldier is of his body , ye would be of more avail to the souls of others . `` `` There is sooth in what you say , lady , '' Alleyne answered ; `` and yet I scarce can see what you would have the clergy and the church to do . `` `` I would have them live as others and do men 's work in the world , preaching by their lives rather than their words . I would have them come forth from their lonely places , mix with the borel folks , feel the pains and the pleasures , the cares and the rewards , the temptings and the stirrings of the common people . Let them toil and swinken , and labor , and plough the land , and take wives to themselves -- -- -- '' '' Alas ! alas ! '' cried Alleyne aghast , `` you have surely sucked this poison from the man Wicliffe , of whom I have heard such evil things . `` `` Nay , I know him not . I have learned it by looking from my own chamber window and marking these poor monks of the priory , their weary life , their profitless round . I have asked myself if the best which can be done with virtue is to shut it within high walls as though it were some savage creature . If the good will lock themselves up , and if the wicked will still wander free , then alas for the world ! `` Alleyne looked at her in astonishment , for her cheek was flushed , her eyes gleaming , and her whole pose full of eloquence and conviction . Yet in an instant she had changed again to her old expression of merriment leavened with mischief . `` Wilt do what I ask ? '' said she . `` What is it , lady ? `` `` Oh , most ungallant clerk ! A true knight would never have asked , but would have vowed upon the instant . 'T is but to bear me out in what I say to my father . `` `` In what ? `` `` In saying , if he ask , that it was south of the Christchurch road that I met you . I shall be shut up with the tire-women else , and have a week of spindle and bodkin , when I would fain be galloping Troubadour up Wilverley Walk , or loosing little Roland at the Vinney Ridge herons . `` `` I shall not answer him if he ask . `` `` Not answer ! But he will have an answer . Nay , but you must not fail me , or it will go ill with me . `` `` But , lady , '' cried poor Alleyne in great distress , `` how can I say that it was to the south of the road when I know well that it was four miles to the north . `` `` You will not say it ? `` `` Surely you will not , too , when you know that it is not so ? `` `` Oh , I weary of your preaching ! '' she cried , and swept away with a toss of her beautiful head , leaving Alleyne as cast down and ashamed as though he had himself proposed some infamous thing . She was back again in an instant , however , in another of her varying moods . `` Look at that , my friend ! '' said she . `` If you had been shut up in abbey or in cell this day you could not have taught a wayward maiden to abide by the truth . Is it not so ? What avail is the shepherd if he leaves his sheep . `` `` A sorry shepherd ! '' said Alleyne humbly . `` But here is your noble father . `` `` And you shall see how worthy a pupil I am . Father , I am much beholden to this young clerk , who was of service to me and helped me this very morning in Minstead Woods , four miles to the north of the Christchurch road , where I had no call to be , you having ordered it otherwise . '' All this she reeled off in a loud voice , and then glanced with sidelong , questioning eyes at Alleyne for his approval.Sir Nigel , who had entered the room with a silvery-haired old lady upon his arm , stared aghast at this sudden outburst of candor . `` Maude , Maude ! '' said he , shaking his head , `` it is more hard for me to gain obedience from you than from the ten score drunken archers who followed me to Guienne . Yet , hush ! little one , for your fair lady-mother will be here anon , and there is no need that she should know it . We will keep you from the provost-marshal this journey . Away to your chamber , sweeting , and keep a blithe face , for she who confesses is shriven . And now , fair mother , '' he continued , when his daughter had gone , `` sit you here by the fire , for your blood runs colder than it did . Alleyne Edricson , I would have a word with you , for I would fain that you should take service under me . And here in good time comes my lady , without whose counsel it is not my wont to decide aught of import ; but , indeed , it was her own thought that you should come . `` `` For I have formed a good opinion of you , and can see that you are one who may be trusted , '' said the Lady Loring . `` And in good sooth my dear lord hath need of such a one by his side , for he recks so little of himself that there should be one there to look to his needs and meet his wants . You have seen the cloisters ; it were well that you should see the world too , ere you make choice for life between them . `` `` It was for that very reason that my father willed that I should come forth into the world at my twentieth year , '' said Alleyne . `` Then your father was a man of good counsel , '' said she , `` and you can not carry out his will better than by going on this path , where all that is noble and gallant in England will be your companions . `` `` You can ride ? '' asked Sir Nigel , looking at the youth with puckered eyes . `` Yes , I have ridden much at the abbey . `` `` Yet there is a difference betwixt a friar 's hack and a warrior 's destrier . You can sing and play ? `` `` On citole , flute and rebeck. '' '' Good ! You can read blazonry ? `` `` Indifferent well . `` `` Then read this , '' quoth Sir Nigel , pointing upwards to one of the many quarterings which adorned the wall over the fireplace . `` Argent , '' Alleyne answered , `` a fess azure charged with three lozenges dividing three mullets sable . Over all , on an escutcheon of the first , a jambe gules . `` `` A jambe gules erased , '' said Sir Nigel , shaking his head solemnly . `` Yet it is not amiss for a monk-bred man . I trust that you are lowly and serviceable ? `` `` I have served all my life , my lord . `` `` Canst carve too ? `` `` I have carved two days a week for the brethren . `` `` A model truly ! Wilt make a squire of squires . But tell me , I pray , canst curl hair ? `` `` No , my lord , but I could learn . `` `` It is of import , '' said he , `` for I love to keep my hair well ordered , seeing that the weight of my helmet for thirty years hath in some degree frayed it upon the top . '' He pulled off his velvet cap of maintenance as he spoke , and displayed a pate which was as bald as an egg , and shone bravely in the firelight . `` You see , '' said he , whisking round , and showing one little strip where a line of scattered hairs , like the last survivors in some fatal field , still barely held their own against the fate which had fallen upon their comrades ; `` these locks need some little oiling and curling , for I doubt not that if you look slantwise at my head , when the light is good , you will yourself perceive that there are places where the hair is sparse . `` `` It is for you also to bear the purse , '' said the lady ; `` for my sweet lord is of so free and gracious a temper that he would give it gayly to the first who asked alms of him . All these things , with some knowledge of venerie , and of the management of horse , hawk and hound , with the grace and hardihood and courtesy which are proper to your age , will make you a fit squire for Sir Nigel Loring. '' '' Alas ! lady , '' Alleyne answered , `` I know well the great honor that you have done me in deeming me worthy to wait upon so renowned a knight , yet I am so conscious of my own weakness that I scarce dare incur duties which I might be so ill-fitted to fulfil . `` `` Modesty and a humble mind , '' said she , `` are the very first and rarest gifts in page or squire . Your words prove that you have these , and all the rest is but the work of use and time . But there is no call for haste . Rest upon it for the night , and let your orisons ask for guidance in the matter . We knew your father well , and would fain help his son , though we have small cause to love your brother the Socman , who is forever stirring up strife in the county . `` `` We can scare hope , '' said Nigel , `` to have all ready for our start before the
