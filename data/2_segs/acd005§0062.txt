began to cast round in circles in search of a trail.But Du Lhut was on his feet again in a moment , and running up and down like a sleuth-hound , noting a hundred things which even Amos would have overlooked . He circled round the bodies again and again . Then he ran a little way towards the edge of the woods , and then came back to the charred ruins of the blockhouse , from some of which a thin reek of smoke was still rising . `` There is no sign of the women and children , '' said he . `` My God ! There were women and children ? `` `` They are keeping the children to burn at their leisure in their villages . The women they may torture or may adopt as the humour takes them . But what does the old man want ? `` `` I want you to ask him , Amos , '' said the seaman , `` why we are yawing and tacking here when we should be cracking on all sail to stand after them ? `` Du Lhut smiled and shook his head . `` Your friend is a brave man , '' said he , `` if he thinks that with four men we can follow a hundred and fifty . `` `` Tell him , Amos , that the Lord will bear us up , '' said the other excitedly . `` Say that He will be with us against the children of Jeroboam , and we will cut them off utterly , and they shall be destroyed . What is the French for 'slay and spare not ' ? I had as soon go about with my jaw braced up , as with folk who can not understand a plain language . `` But Du Lhut waved aside the seaman 's suggestions . `` We must have a care now , '' said he , `` or we shall lose our own scalps , and be the cause of those at Sainte Marie losing theirs as well . `` `` Sainte Marie ! '' cried De Catinat . `` Is there then danger at SainteMarie ? `` `` Ay , they are in the wolf 's mouth now . This business was done last night . The place was stormed by a war-party of a hundred and fifty men . This morning they left and went north upon foot . They have beencachedamong the woods all day between Poitou and Sainte Marie . `` `` Then we have come through them ? `` `` Yes , we have come through them . They would keep their camp to-day and send out scouts . Brown Moose and his son were among them and struck our trail . To-night -- - '' '' To-night they will attack Sainte Marie ? `` `` It is possible . And yet with so small a party I should scarce have thought that they would have dared . Well , we can but hasten back as quickly as we can , and give them warning of what is hanging over them . `` And so they turned for their weary backward journey , though their minds were too full to spare a thought upon the leagues which lay behind them or those which were before . Old Ephraim , less accustomed to walking than his younger comrades , was already limping and footsore , but , for all his age , he was as tough as hickory , and full of endurance . Du Lhut took the lead again and they turned their faces once more towards the north.The moon was shining brightly in the sky , but it was little aid to the travellers in the depths of the forest . Where it had been shadowy in the daytime it was now so absolutely dark that De Catinat could not see the tree-trunks against which he brushed . Here and there they came upon an open glade bathed in the moonshine , or perhaps a thin shaft of silver light broke through between the branches , and cast a great white patch upon the ground , but Du Lhut preferred to avoid these more open spaces , and to skirt the glades rather than to cross them . The breeze had freshened a little , and the whole air was filled with the rustle and sough of the leaves . Save for this dull never-ceasing sound all would have been silent had not the owl hooted sometimes from among the tree-tops , and the night-jar whirred above their heads.Dark as it was , Du Lhut walked as swiftly as during the sunlight , and never hesitated about the track . His comrades could see , however , that he was taking them a different way to that which they had gone in the morning , for twice they caught a sight of the glimmer of the broad river upon their left , while before they had only seen the streams which flowed into it . On the second occasion he pointed to where , on the farther side , they could see dark shadows flitting over the water . `` Iroquois canoes , '' he whispered . `` There are ten of them with eight men in each . They are another party , and they are also going north . `` `` How do you know that they are another party ? `` `` Because we have crossed the trail of the first within the hour . `` De Catinat was filled with amazement at this marvellous man who could hear in his sleep and could detect a trail when the very tree-trunks were invisible to ordinary eyes . Du Lhut halted a little to watch the canoes , and then turned his back to the river , and plunged into the woods once more . They had gone a mile or two when suddenly he came to a dead stop , snuffing at the air like a hound on a scent . `` I smell burning wood , '' said he . `` There is a fire within a mile of us in that direction . `` `` I smell it too , '' said Amos . `` Let us creep up that way and see their camp . `` `` Be careful , then , '' whispered Du Lhut , `` for your lives may hang from a cracking twig . `` They advanced very slowly and cautiously until suddenly the red flare of a leaping fire twinkled between the distant trunks . Still slipping through the brushwood , they worked round until they had found a point from which they could see without a risk of being seen.A great blaze of dry logs crackled and spurtled in the centre of a small clearing . The ruddy flames roared upwards , and the smoke spread out above it until it looked like a strange tree with gray foliage and trunk of fire . But no living being was in sight and the huge fire roared and swayed in absolute solitude in the midst of the silent woodlands . Nearer they crept and nearer , but there was no movement save the rush of the flames , and no sound but the snapping of the sticks . `` Shall we go up to it ? '' whispered De Catinat . The wary old pioneer shook his head . `` It may be a trap , '' said he . `` Or an abandoned camp ? `` `` No , it has not been lit more than an hour . `` `` Besides , it is far too great for a camp fire , '' said Amos . `` What do you make of it ? '' asked Du Lhut . `` A signal . `` `` Yes , I daresay that you are right . This light is not a safe neighbour , so we shall edge away from it and then make a straight line for Sainte Marie . `` The flames were soon but a twinkling point behind them , and at last vanished behind the trees . Du Lhut pushed on rapidly until they came to the edge of a moonlit clearing . He was about to skirt this , as he had done others , when suddenly he caught De Catinat by the shoulder and pushed him down behind a clump of sumach , while Amos did the same with Ephraim Savage.A man was walking down the other side of the open space . He had just emerged , and was crossing it diagonally , making in the direction of the river . His body was bent double , but as he came out from the shadow of the trees they could see that he was an Indian brave in full war-paint , with leggings , loin-cloth , and musket . Close at his heels came a second , and then a third and a fourth , on and on until it seemed as if the wood were full of men , and that the line would never come to an end . They flitted past like shadows in the moonlight , in absolute silence , all crouching and running in the same swift stealthy fashion . Last of all came a man in the fringed tunic of a hunter , with a cap and feather upon his head . He passed across like the others , and they vanished into the shadows as silently as they had appeared . It was five minutes before Du Lhut thought it safe to rise from their shelter . `` By Saint Anne , '' he whispered , `` did you count them ? `` `` Three hundred and ninety-six , '' said Amos . `` I made it four hundred and two . `` `` And you thought that there were only a hundred and fifty of them ! '' cried De Catinat . `` Ah , you do not understand . This is a fresh band . The others who took the blockhouse must be over there , for their trail lies between us and the river . `` `` They could not be the same , '' said Amos , `` for there was not a fresh scalp among them . `` Du Lhut gave the young hunter a glance of approval . `` On my word , '' saidhe , `` I did not know that your woodsmen are as good as they seem to be.You have eyes , monsieur , and it may please you some day to remember thatGreysolon du Lhut told you so . `` Amos felt a flush of pride at these words from a man whose name was honoured wherever trader or trapper smoked round a camp fire . He was about to make some answer when a dreadful cry broke suddenly out of the woods , a horrible screech , as from some one who was goaded to the very last pitch of human misery . Again and again , as they stood with blanched cheeks in the darkness , they heard that awful cry swelling up from the night and ringing drearily through the forest . `` They are torturing the women , '' said Du Lhut . `` Their camp lies over there . `` `` Can we do nothing to aid them ? '' cried Amos . `` Ay , ay , lad , '' said the captain in English . `` We ca n't pass distress signals without going out of our course . Let us put about and run down yonder . `` `` In that camp , '' said Du Lhut slowly , `` there are now nearly six hundred warriors . We are four . What you say
