speech had cost the blunt bowman much pains and planning ; but he might have spared his breath , for the lady was quite as much absorbed as her lord in the letter , which they held between them , a hand on either corner , spelling it out very slowly , with drawn brows and muttering lips . As they read it , Alleyne , who stood with Hordle John a few paces back from their comrade , saw the lady catch her breath , while the knight laughed softly to himself . `` You see , dear heart , '' said he , `` that they will not leave the old dog in his kennel when the game is afoot . And what of this White Company , archer ? `` `` Ah , sir , you speak of dogs , '' cried Aylward ; `` but there are a pack of lusty hounds who are ready for any quarry , if they have but a good huntsman to halloo them on . Sir , we have been in the wars together , and I have seen many a brave following but never such a set of woodland boys as this . They do but want you at their head , and who will bar the way to them ! '' '' Pardieu ! '' said Sir Nigel , `` if they are all like their messenger , they are indeed men of whom a leader may be proud . Your name , good archer ? `` `` Sam Aylward , sir , of the Hundred of Easebourne and the Rape of Chichester . `` `` And this giant behind you ? `` `` He is big John , of Hordle , a forest man , who hath now taken service in the Company . `` `` A proper figure of a man at-arms , '' said the little knight . `` Why , man , you are no chicken , yet I warrant him the stronger man . See to that great stone from the coping which hath fallen upon the bridge . Four of my lazy varlets strove this day to carry it hence . I would that you two could put them to shame by budging it , though I fear that I overtask you , for it is of a grievous weight . `` He pointed as he spoke to a huge rough-hewn block which lay by the roadside , deep sunken from its own weight in the reddish earth . The archer approached it , rolling back the sleeves of his jerkin , but with no very hopeful countenance , for indeed it was a mighty rock . John , however , put him aside with his left hand , and , stooping over the stone , he plucked it single-handed from its soft bed and swung it far into the stream . There it fell with mighty splash , one jagged end peaking out above the surface , while the waters bubbled and foamed with far-circling eddy . `` Good lack ! '' cried Sir Nigel , and `` Good lack ! '' cried his lady , while John stood laughing and wiping the caked dirt from his fingers . `` I have felt his arms round my ribs , '' said the bowman , `` and they crackle yet at the thought of it . This other comrade of mine is a right learned clerk , for all that he is so young , hight Alleyne , the son of Edric , brother to the Socman of Minstead . `` `` Young man , '' quoth Sir Nigel , sternly , `` if you are of the same way of thought as your brother , you may not pass under portcullis of mine . `` `` Nay , fair sir , '' cried Aylward hastily , `` I will be pledge for it that they have no thought in common ; for this very day his brother hath set his dogs upon him , and driven him from his lands . `` `` And are you , too , of the White Company ? '' asked Sir Nigel . `` Hast had small experience of war , if I may judge by your looks and bearing . `` `` I would fain to France with my friends here , '' Alleyne answered ; `` but I am a man of peace -- -a reader , exorcist , acolyte , and clerk . `` `` That need not hinder , '' quoth Sir Nigel . `` No , fair sir , '' cried the bowman joyously . `` Why , I myself have served two terms with Arnold de Cervolles , he whom they called the archpriest . By my hilt ! I have seen him ere now , with monk 's gown trussed to his knees , over his sandals in blood in the fore-front of the battle . Yet , ere the last string had twanged , he would be down on his four bones among the stricken , and have them all houseled and shriven , as quick as shelling peas . Ma foi ! there were those who wished that he would have less care for their souls and a little more for their bodies ! `` `` It is well to have a learned clerk in every troop , '' said Sir Nigel . `` By St. Paul , there are men so caitiff that they think more of a scrivener 's pen than of their lady 's smile , and do their devoir in hopes that they may fill a line in a chronicle or make a tag to a jongleur 's romance . I remember well that , at the siege of Retters , there was a little , sleek , fat clerk of the name of Chaucer , who was so apt at rondel , sirvente , or tonson , that no man dare give back a foot from the walls , lest he find it all set down in his rhymes and sung by every underling and varlet in the camp . But , my soul 's bird , you hear me prate as though all were decided , when I have not yet taken counsel either with you or with my lady mother . Let us to the chamber , while these strangers find such fare as pantry and cellar may furnish . `` `` The night air strikes chill , '' said the lady , and turned down the road with her hand upon her lord 's arm . The three comrades dropped behind and followed : Aylward much the lighter for having accomplished his mission , Alleyne full of wonderment at the humble bearing of so renowned a captain , and John loud with snorts and sneers , which spoke his disappointment and contempt . `` What ails the man ? '' asked Aylward in surprise . `` I have been cozened and bejaped , '' quoth he gruffly . `` By whom , Sir Samson the strong ? `` `` By thee , Sir Balaam the false prophet . `` `` By my hilt ! '' cried the archer , `` though I be not Balaam , yet I hold converse with the very creature that spake to him . What is amiss , then , and how have I played you false ? `` `` Why , marry , did you not say , and Alleyne here will be my witness , that , if I would hie to the wars with you , you would place me under a leader who was second to none in all England for valor ? Yet here you bring me to a shred of a man , peaky and ill-nourished , with eyes like a moulting owl , who must needs , forsooth , take counsel with his mother ere he buckle sword to girdle . `` `` Is that where the shoe galls ? '' cried the bowman , and laughed aloud . `` I will ask you what you think of him three months hence , if we be all alive ; for sure I am that -- -- -- '' Aylward 's words were interrupted by an extraordinary hubbub which broke out that instant some little way down the street in the direction of the Priory . There was deep-mouthed shouting of men , frightened shrieks of women , howling and barking of curs , and over all a sullen , thunderous rumble , indescribably menacing and terrible . Round the corner of the narrow street there came rushing a brace of whining dogs with tails tucked under their legs , and after them a white-faced burgher , with outstretched hands and wide-spread fingers , his hair all abristle and his eyes glinting back from one shoulder to the other , as though some great terror were at his very heels . `` Fly , my lady , fly ! '' he screeched , and whizzed past them like bolt from bow ; while close behind came lumbering a huge black bear , with red tongue lolling from his mouth , and a broken chain jangling behind him . To right and left the folk flew for arch and doorway . Hordle John caught up the Lady Loring as though she had been a feather , and sprang with her into an open porch ; while Aylward , with a whirl of French oaths , plucked at his quiver and tried to unsling his bow . Alleyne , all unnerved at so strange and unwonted a sight , shrunk up against the wall with his eyes fixed upon the frenzied creature , which came bounding along with ungainly speed , looking the larger in the uncertain light , its huge jaws agape , with blood and slaver trickling to the ground . Sir Nigel alone , unconscious to all appearance of the universal panic , walked with unfaltering step up the centre of the road , a silken handkerchief in one hand and his gold comfit-box in the other . It sent the blood cold through Alleyne 's veins to see that as they came together -- -the man and the beast -- -the creature reared up , with eyes ablaze with fear and hate , and whirled its great paws above the knight to smite him to the earth . He , however , blinking with puckered eyes , reached up his kerchief , and flicked the beast twice across the snout with it . `` Ah , saucy ! saucy , '' quoth he , with gentle chiding ; on which the bear , uncertain and puzzled , dropped its four legs to earth again , and , waddling back , was soon swathed in ropes by the bear-ward and a crowd of peasants who had been in close pursuit.A scared man was the keeper ; for , having chained the brute to a stake while he drank a stoup of ale at the inn , it had been baited by stray curs , until , in wrath and madness , it had plucked loose the chain , and smitten or bitten all who came in its path . Most scared of all was he to find that the creature had come nigh to harm the Lord and Lady of the castle , who had power to place him in the stretch-neck or to have the skin scourged from his shoulders . Yet , when he came with bowed head and humble entreaty for forgiveness , he was met with a handful of small silver from Sir Nigel , whose dame , however , was less charitably disposed , being much ruffled in her dignity by the manner in which she had been hustled from her
