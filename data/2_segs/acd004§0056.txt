now at the stranger with a wrinkled brow and the air of a man who is striving to stir his memory . `` By my hilt ! I have seen the thick body of him before to-day . Yet I can not call to mind where it could have been . At Nogent belike , or was it at Auray ? Mark me , lads , this man will prove to be one of the best lances of France , and there are no better in the world . `` `` It is but child 's play , this poking game , '' said John . `` I would fain try my hand at it , for , by the black rood ! I think that it might be amended . `` `` What then would you do , John ? '' asked several . `` There are many things which might be done , '' said the forester thoughtfully . `` Methinks that I would begin by breaking my spear . `` `` So they all strive to do . `` `` Nay , but not upon another man 's shield . I would break it over my own knee . `` `` And what the better for that , old beef and bones ? '' asked Black Simon . `` So I would turn what is but a lady 's bodkin of a weapon into a very handsome club . `` `` And then , John ? `` `` Then I would take the other 's spear into my arm or my leg , or where it pleased him best to put it , and I would dash out his brains with my club . `` `` By my ten finger-bones ! old John , '' said Aylward , `` I would give my feather-bed to see you at a spear-running . This is a most courtly and gentle sport which you have devised . `` `` So it seems to me , '' said John seriously . `` Or , again , one might seize the other round the middle , pluck him off his horse and bear him to the pavilion , there to hold him to ransom. '' '' Good ! '' cried Simon , amid a roar of laughter from all the archers round . `` By Thomas of Kent ! we shall make a camp-marshal of thee , and thou shalt draw up rules for our jousting . But , John , who is it that you would uphold in this knightly and pleasing fashion ? `` `` What mean you ? `` `` Why , John , so strong and strange a tilter must fight for the brightness of his lady 's eyes or the curve of her eyelash , even as Sir Nigel does for the Lady Loring . `` `` I know not about that , '' said the big archer , scratching his head in perplexity . `` Since Mary hath played me false , I can scarce fight for her . `` `` Yet any woman will serve . `` `` There is my mother then , '' said John . `` She was at much pains at my upbringing , and , by my soul ! I will uphold the curve of her eyelashes , for it tickleth my very heart-root to think of her . But who is here ? `` `` It is Sir William Beauchamp . He is a valiant man , but I fear that he is scarce firm enough upon the saddle to bear the thrust of such a tilter as this stranger promises to be . `` Aylward 's words were speedily justified , for even as he spoke the two knights met in the centre of the lists . Beauchamp struck his opponent a shrewd blow upon the helmet , but was met with so frightful a thrust that he whirled out of his saddle and rolled over and over upon the ground . Sir Thomas Percy met with little better success , for his shield was split , his vambrace torn and he himself wounded slightly in the side . Lord Audley and the unknown knight struck each other fairly upon the helmet ; but , while the stranger sat as firm and rigid as ever upon his charger , the Englishman was bent back to his horse 's cropper by the weight of the blow , and had galloped half-way down the lists ere he could recover himself . Sir Thomas Wake was beaten to the ground with a battle-axe -- -that being the weapon which he had selected -- -and had to be carried to his pavilion . These rapid successes , gained one after the other over four celebrated warriors , worked the crowd up to a pitch of wonder and admiration . Thunders of applause from the English soldiers , as well as from the citizens and peasants , showed how far the love of brave and knightly deeds could rise above the rivalries of race . `` By my soul ! John , '' cried the prince , with his cheek flushed and his eyes shining , `` this is a man of good courage and great hardiness . I could not have thought that there was any single arm upon earth which could have overthrown these four champions . `` `` He is indeed , as I have said , sire , a knight from whom much honor is to be gained . But the lower edge of the sun is wet , and it will be beneath the sea ere long . `` `` Here is Sir Nigel Loring , on foot and with his sword , '' said the prince . `` I have heard that he is a fine swordsman . `` `` The finest in your army , sire , '' Chandos answered . `` Yet I doubt not that he will need all his skill this day . `` As he spoke , the two combatants advanced from either end in full armor with their two-handed swords sloping over their shoulders . The stranger walked heavily and with a measured stride , while the English knight advanced as briskly as though there was no iron shell to weigh down the freedom of his limbs . At four paces distance they stopped , eyed each other for a moment , and then in an instant fell to work with a clatter and clang as though two sturdy smiths were busy upon their anvils . Up and down went the long , shining blades , round and round they circled in curves of glimmering light , crossing , meeting , disengaging , with flash of sparks at every parry . Here and there bounded Sir Nigel , his head erect , his jaunty plume fluttering in the air , while his dark opponent sent in crashing blow upon blow , following fiercely up with cut and with thrust , but never once getting past the practised blade of the skilled swordsman . The crowd roared with delight as Sir Nigel would stoop his head to avoid a blow , or by some slight movement of his body allow some terrible thrust to glance harmlessly past him . Suddenly , however , his time came . The Frenchman , whirling up his sword , showed for an instant a chink betwixt his shoulder piece and the rerebrace which guarded his upper arm . In dashed Sir Nigel , and out again so swiftly that the eye could not follow the quick play of his blade , but a trickle of blood from the stranger 's shoulder , and a rapidly widening red smudge upon his white surcoat , showed where the thrust had taken effect . The wound was , however , but a slight one , and the Frenchman was about to renew his onset , when , at a sign from the prince , Chandos threw down his baton , and the marshals of the lists struck up the weapons and brought the contest to an end . `` It were time to check it , '' said the prince , smiling , `` for Sir Nigel is too good a man for me to lose , and , by the five holy wounds ! if one of those cuts came home I should have fears for our champion . What think you , Pedro ? `` `` I think , Edward , that the little man was very well able to take care of himself . For my part , I should wish to see so well matched a pair fight on while a drop of blood remained in their veins . `` `` We must have speech with him . Such a man must not go from my court without rest or sup . Bring him hither , Chandos , and , certes , if the Lord Loring hath resigned his claim upon this goblet , it is right and proper that this cavalier should carry it to France with him as a sign of the prowess that he has shown this day . `` As he spoke , the knight-errant , who had remounted his warhorse , galloped forward to the royal stand , with a silken kerchief bound round his wounded arm . The setting sun cast a ruddy glare upon his burnished arms , and sent his long black shadow streaming behind him up the level clearing . Pulling up his steed , he slightly inclined his head , and sat in the stern and composed fashion with which he had borne himself throughout , heedless of the applauding shouts and the flutter of kerchiefs from the long lines of brave men and of fair women who were looking down upon him . `` Sir knight , '' said the prince , `` we have all marvelled this day at this great skill and valor with which God has been pleased to endow you . I would fain that you should tarry at our court , for a time at least , until your hurt is healed and your horses rested . `` `` My hurt is nothing , sire , nor are my horses weary , '' returned the stranger in a deep , stern voice . `` Will you not at least hie back to Bordeaux with us , that you may drain a cup of muscadine and sup at our table ? `` `` I will neither drink your wine nor sit at your table , '' returned the other . `` I bear no love for you or for your race , and there is nought that I wish at your hands until the day when I see the last sail which bears you back to your island vanishing away against the western sky . `` `` These are bitter words , sir knight , '' said Prince Edward , with an angry frown . `` And they come from a bitter heart , '' answered the unknown knight . `` How long is it since there has been peace in my hapless country ? Where are the steadings , and orchards , and vineyards , which made France fair ? Where are the cities which made her great ? From Providence to Burgundy we are beset by every prowling hireling in Christendom , who rend and tear the country which you have left too weak to guard her own marches . Is it not a by-word that a man may ride all day in that unhappy land without seeing thatch upon roof or hearing the crow of cock ? Does not one fair kingdom content you , that you should strive so for this other one which has no love for you ? Pardieu ! a true Frenchman 's
