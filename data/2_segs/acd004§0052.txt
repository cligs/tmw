it is the women that are sour , but the wines are rich . Anjou , however , is a very good land for bowmen , for wine and women are all that heart could wish . In Touraine I got nothing save a broken pate , but at Vierzon I had a great good fortune , for I had a golden pyx from the minster , for which I afterwards got nine Genoan janes from the goldsmith in the Rue Mont Olive . From thence we went to Bourges , where I had a tunic of flame-colored silk and a very fine pair of shoes with tassels of silk and drops of silver . `` `` From a stall , Aylward ? '' asked one of the young archers . `` Nay , from a man 's feet , lad . I had reason to think that he might not need them again , seeing that a thirty-inch shaft had feathered in his back . `` `` And what then , Aylward ? `` `` On we went , coz , some six thousand of us , until we came to Issodun , and there again a very great thing befell . `` `` A battle , Aylward ? `` `` Nay , nay ; a greater thing than that . There is little to be gained out of a battle , unless one have the fortune to win a ransom . At Issodun I and three Welshmen came upon a house which all others had passed , and we had the profit of it to ourselves . For myself , I had a fine feather-bed -- -a thing which you will not see in a long day 's journey in England . You have seen it , Alleyne , and you , John . You will bear me out that it is a noble bed . We put it on a sutler 's mule , and bore it after the army . It was on my mind that I would lay it by until I came to start house of mine own , and I have it now in a very safe place near Lyndhurst . `` `` And what then , master-bowman ? '' asked Hawtayne . `` By St. Christopher ! it is indeed a fair and goodly life which you have chosen , for you gather up the spoil as a Warsash man gathers lobsters , without grace or favor from any man . `` `` You are right , master-shipman , '' said another of the older archers . `` It is an old bowyer 's rede that the second feather of a fenny goose is better than the pinion of a tame one . Draw on old lad , for I have come between you and the clout . `` `` On we went then , '' said Aylward , after a long pull at his blackjack . `` There were some six thousand of us , with the prince and his knights , and the feather-bed upon a sutler 's mule in the centre . We made great havoc in Touraine , until we came into Romorantin , where I chanced upon a gold chain and two bracelets of jasper , which were stolen from me the same day by a black-eyed wench from the Ardennes . Mon Dieu ! there are some folk who have no fear of Domesday in them , and no sign of grace in their souls , for ever clutching and clawing at another man 's chattels . `` `` But the battle , Aylward , the battle ! '' cried several , amid a burst of laughter . `` I come to it , my young war-pups . Well , then , the King of France had followed us with fifty thousand men , and he made great haste to catch us , but when he had us he scarce knew what to do with us , for we were so drawn up among hedges and vineyards that they could not come nigh us , save by one lane . On both sides were archers , men-at-arms and knights behind , and in the centre the baggage , with my feather-bed upon a sutler 's mule . Three hundred chosen knights came straight for it , and , indeed , they were very brave men , but such a drift of arrows met them that few came back . Then came the Germans , and they also fought very bravely , so that one or two broke through the archers and came as far as the feather-bed , but all to no purpose . Then out rides our own little hothead with the patch over his eye , and my Lord Audley with his four Cheshire squires , and a few others of like kidney , and after them went the prince and Chandos , and then the whole throng of us , with axe and sword , for we had shot away our arrows . Ma foi ! it was a foolish thing , for we came forth from the hedges , and there was naught to guard the baggage had they ridden round behind us . But all went well with us , and the king was taken , and little Robby Withstaff and I fell in with a wain with twelve firkins of wine for the king 's own table , and , by my hilt ! if you ask me what happened after that , I can not answer you , nor can little Robby Withstaff either . `` `` And next day ? `` `` By my faith ! we did not tarry long , but we hied back to Bordeaux , where we came in safety with the King of France and also the feather-bed . I sold my spoil , mes garcons , for as many gold-pieces as I could hold in my hufken , and for seven days I lit twelve wax candles upon the altar of St. Andrew ; for if you forget the blessed when things are well with you , they are very likely to forget you when you have need of them . I have a score of one hundred and nineteen pounds of wax against the holy Andrew , and , as he was a very just man , I doubt not that I shall have full weigh and measure when I have most need of it . `` `` Tell me , master Aylward , '' cried a young fresh-faced archer at the further end of the room , `` what was this great battle about ? `` `` Why , you jack-fool , what would it be about save who should wear the crown of France ? `` `` I thought that mayhap it might be as to who should have this feather-bed of thine . `` `` If I come down to you , Silas , I may lay my belt across your shoulders , '' Aylward answered , amid a general shout of laughter . `` But it is time young chickens went to roost when they dare cackle against their elders . It is late , Simon . `` `` Nay , let us have another song . `` `` Here is Arnold of Sowley will troll as good a stave as any man in the Company . `` `` Nay , we have one here who is second to none , '' said Hawtayne , laying his hand upon big John 's shoulder . `` I have heard him on the cog with a voice like the wave upon the shore . I pray you , friend , to give us 'The Bells of Milton , ' or , if you will , 'The Franklin 's Maid . ' '' Hordle John drew the back of his hand across his mouth , fixed his eyes upon the corner of the ceiling , and bellowed forth , in a voice which made the torches flicker , the southland ballad for which he had been asked : -- - The franklin he hath gone to roam , The franklin 's maid she bides at home , But she is cold and coy and staid , And who may win the franklin 's maid ? There came a knight of high renown In bassinet and ciclatoun ; On bended knee full long he prayed , He might not win the franklin 's maid . There came a squire so debonair His dress was rich , his words were fair , He sweetly sang , he deftly played : He could not win the franklin 's maid . There came a mercer wonder-fine With velvet cap and gaberdine ; For all his ships , for all his trade He could not buy the franklin 's maid . There came an archer bold and true , With bracer guard and stave of yew ; His purse was light , his jerkin frayed ; Haro , alas ! the franklin 's maid ! Oh , some have laughed and some have cried And some have scoured the country-side ! But off they ride through wood and glade , The bowman and the franklin 's maid.A roar of delight from his audience , with stamping of feet and beating of blackjacks against the ground , showed how thoroughly the song was to their taste , while John modestly retired into a quart pot , which he drained in four giant gulps . `` I sang that ditty in Hordle ale-house ere I ever thought to be an archer myself , '' quoth he . `` Fill up your stoups ! '' cried Black Simon , thrusting his own goblet into the open hogshead in front of him . `` Here is a last cup to the White Company , and every brave boy who walks behind the roses of Loring ! `` `` To the wood , the flax , and the gander 's wing ! '' said an old gray-headed archer on the right . `` To a gentle loose , and the King of Spain for a mark at fourteen score ! '' cried another . `` To a bloody war ! '' shouted a fourth . `` Many to go and few to come ! `` `` With the most gold to the best steel ! '' added a fifth . `` And a last cup to the maids of our heart ! '' cried Aylward . `` A steady hand and a true eye , boys ; so let two quarts be a bowman 's portion . '' With shout and jest and snatch of song they streamed from the room , and all was peaceful once more in the `` Rose de Guienne . `` So used were the good burghers of Bordeaux to martial display and knightly sport , that an ordinary joust or tournament was an everyday matter with them . The fame and brilliancy of the prince 's court had drawn the knights-errant and pursuivants-of-arms from every part of Europe . In the long lists by the Garonne on the landward side of the northern gate there had been many a strange combat , when the Teutonic knight , fresh from the conquest of the Prussian heathen , ran a course against the knight of Calatrava , hardened by continual struggle against the Moors , or cavaliers from Portugal broke a lance with Scandinavian warriors from the further shore of the great Northern Ocean . Here fluttered many an outland pennon , bearing symbol and blazonry from the banks of the Danube , the wilds of Lithuania and the mountain strongholds of Hungary ; for chivalry was of no clime and of no race , nor was any land so wild that the fame and name
