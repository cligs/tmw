mistaken . He 's not gone yet ! `` `` That is theBlack Eagle , '' his father said with confidence . `` I know her by the cut of her stern and the rake of her masts . `` As they came nearer still , any lingering doubt was finally dispelled . `` There 's the white paint line , '' said Ezra . `` It 's certainly her.Take us alongside that ship which is lying to the outside there , Sampson . `` The fisherman looked ahead once more . `` To the barque which has just got her anchor up ? '' he said . `` Why , we wo n't be in time to catch her . `` `` Her anchor up ! '' screamed Ezra . `` You do n't mean to tell me she 's off ! `` `` Look at that ! '' the man answered.As he spoke they saw first one great square of canvas appear above the vessel , and then another , until she had spread her white wings to their fullest extent . `` Do n't say we ca n't catch her ! '' cried Ezra , with a furious oath . `` I tell you , man , that we must catch her . Everything depends on that . `` `` She must take three short tacks before she 's out from the Goodwins . If we run right on as we are going , we may get near her before she 's free . `` `` For God 's sake ! clap on all the sail you can ! Get these reefs out ! '' With trembling fingers Ezra let out the sail , and the boat lay over further under the increased pressure . `` Is there no other sail that we could put up ? `` `` If we were running , we could rig up a spinnaker , '' the fisherman answered ; `` but the wind has come round three points . We can do no more . `` `` I think we are catching her , '' John Girdlestone cried , keeping his eyes fixed upon the barque , which was about a mile and a half ahead . `` Yes , we are now , but she hai n't got her way on yet . She 'll draw ahead presently ; wo n't she , Jarge ? `` The fisherman 's son nodded , and burst into hoarse merriment . `` It 's better'n a race , '' he cried . `` With our necks for a prize , '' Ezra muttered to himself . `` It 's a little too exciting to be pleasant . We are still gaining . `` They had a clear view of the dark hull and towering canvas of the barque as she swept along in front of them , intending evidently to take advantage of the wind in order to get outside the Goodwins before beating up Channel . `` She 's going about , '' Sampson remarked . As he spoke the snow-white pile lay over in the opposite direction , and the whole broadside of the vessel became visible to them , every sail standing out as though carved from ivory against the cold blue sky . `` If we do n't catch her on this tack we wo n't get her at all , '' the fisherman observed . `` When they put about next they 'll reach right out into the Channel . `` `` Where 's something white ? '' said Ezra excitedly . He dived into the cabin and reappeared with a dirty table-cloth . `` Stand up here , father ! Now keep on waving it ! They may see you . `` `` I think as we are overhaulin ' of them , '' remarked the boy . `` We 're doing that , '' his father answered . `` The question is , will we get near enough to stop 'em afore they gets off on the next tack ? `` The old merchant was standing in the bows waving the signal in the air . His son sprang up beside him and flourished his handkerchief . `` They do n't look more than half a mile off . Let us shout together . '' The two blended their voices in a hoarse roar , which was taken up by the boatman and his son . `` Once again ! '' cried Ezra ; and again their shout resounded over the sea -- -a long-drawn cry it was , with a ring of despair and of sorrow . Still the barque kept steadily on her way . `` If they do n't go about we shall catch them , '' the fisherman said . `` If they keep on another five minutes we are right . `` `` Do you hear that ? '' Ezra cried to his father ; and they both shouted with new energy and waved their signals . `` They 're goin ' about , '' George burst in . `` It 's all up . '' Girdlestone groaned as he saw the mainyard swing back . They all strained their eyes , waiting for the other to follow . It remained stationary . `` They have seen us ! '' cried the fisherman . `` They are waitin ' to pick us up ! `` `` Then we are saved ! '' said Ezra , stepping down and wiping the perspiration which poured from his forehead . `` Go down into the cabin , father , and put yourself straight . You look like a ghost . `` Captain Hamilton Miggs had found the liquor of theCock and Cowslipso very much to his taste , in spite of its vitriolic peculiarities recorded in a preceding chapter , that he rejoined his ship in a very shaky and demoralized condition . He was a devout believer in the homoeopathic revelation that like may be cured by like , so he forthwith proceeded to set himself straight by the consumption of an unlimited quantity of ship 's rum . `` What 's the good of having a pilot aboard if I am to keep sober ? '' he hiccoughed to his mate McPherson . After which piece of logic he shut himself up in his cabin and roared comic songs all the way from London to Gravesend . He was so exhausted by his performance that he fell fast asleep , and snored stertorously for fifteen hours , at the end of which time he came on deck and found that theBlack Eaglewas lying off Deal , and that her anchor was just being hoisted for a start up Channel.Captain Hamilton Miggs watched the sail-setting with his hands in his pockets , and swore promiscuously at every one , from the mate downwards , in a hearty comprehensive way , which showed a mind that was superior to petty distinctions . Having run over all the oaths that he could think of , he dived below and helped himself from the rum bottle , a process which appeared to aid his memory or his invention , for he reappeared upon deck and evolved a new many-jointed expletive at the man at the wheel . He then strode in gloomy majesty up and down the quarter-deck , casting his eyes at the sails and at the clouds in a critical way calculated to impress the crew generally with a sense of their captain 's extraordinary sagacity.TheBlank Eaglehad gone about for the second time , and was just about to free herself from the Goodwins and reach out into the Channel , when Miggs ' eye happened to fall upon the fishing boat in pursuit and the white flutter in her bows . He examined her with his glass , steadying it as well as he could by leaning it across the rail , as his hand was very shaky . After a short inspection , a look of astonishment , followed by one of resignation , stole over his features . `` I 've got them again , Mac , '' he remarked to the mate . `` Got what , sir ? `` `` The diddleums , the jumps , the visions . It 's the change of air as has done it . `` `` You look all right , '' remarked the mate in a sympathetic voice . `` So I may ; but I 've got 'em . It 's usually rats -- -rats , and sometimes cockroaches ; but it 's worse than that this time . As I 'm a livin ' man , I looked through the glass at that fishing-boat astern of us , and I saw young Muster Ezra Girdlestone in it , and the old boss standin ' up wi ' a yachtin'-cap at the side of his head and waving a towel . This is the smartest bout that ever I have had . I 'll take some of the medicine left from my last touch and I 'll turn in . '' He vanished down the companion , and having taken a strong dose of bromide of potassium , tumbled into his bunk , cursing loudly at his ill luck.The astonishment of McPherson upon deck was as great as that of Captain Miggs , when , on looking through the glass , he ascertained beyond all doubt that both of his employers were in the fishing-boat . He at once ordered the mainyard to be hauled back and awaited their arrival . In a few minutes the boat was alongside , a ladder thrown down , and the two Girdlestones were on the deck of their own ship . `` Where 's the captain ? '' asked the head of the firm . `` He 's below , sir . He 's no very salubrious . '' The mate 's love of long words rose superior to any personal emotion . `` You can square the yard , '' said Ezra . `` We are going with you . `` `` Ay , ay , sir . Square away that yard there ! '' It swung round into position , and theBlack Eagleresumed her voyage . `` There is some business to be looked after in Spain , '' Girdlestone remarked to McPherson . `` It came up suddenly or we should have given you notice . It was absolutely necessary that we should be there personally . It was more convenient to go in our own vessel than to wait for a passenger ship . `` `` Where will you sleep , sir ? '' asked the mate . `` I doubt the accommodation 's no very munificent . `` `` There are two settees in the cabin . We can do on them very well . I think we ca n't do better than go down there at once , for we have had a long and tiring journey . `` After they had disappeared into the cabin , McPherson trod the deck for the remainder of his watch with a grave and a thoughtful face . Like most of his countrymen he was shrewd and long-headed . It struck him that it was a very strange thing for the two partners to be absent at the same time from their business . Again , where was their luggage ? Grave misgivings arose in his mind as to the reason of it all . He kept them to himself , however , and contented himself with remarking to the carpenter that in all his experience he had never met with a more `` monumentous episode . `` The early part of the voyage of theBlack Eaglewas extremely fortunate . The wind came round to the eastward , and wafted
