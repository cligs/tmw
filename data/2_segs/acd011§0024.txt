their stead . And we are making it dangerous for ourselves . The small men could not harm us . They had not the money nor the power . So long as we did not squeeze them too dry , they would stay on under our power . But if these big companies find that we stand between them and their profits , they will spare no pains and no expense to hunt us down and bring us to court . `` There was a hush at these ominous words , and every face darkened as gloomy looks were exchanged . So omnipotent and unchallenged had they been that the very thought that there was possible retribution in the background had been banished from their minds . And yet the idea struck a chill to the most reckless of them . `` It is my advice , '' the speaker continued , `` that we go easier upon the small men . On the day that they have all been driven out the power of this society will have been broken . `` Unwelcome truths are not popular . There were angry cries as the speaker resumed his seat . McGinty rose with gloom upon his brow . `` Brother Morris , '' said he , `` you were always a croaker . So long as the members of this lodge stand together there is no power in the United States that can touch them . Sure , have we not tried it often enough in the lawcourts ? I expect the big companies will find it easier to pay than to fight , same as the little companies do . And now , Brethren , '' McGinty took off his black velvet cap and his stole as he spoke , `` this lodge has finished its business for the evening , save for one small matter which may be mentioned when we are parting . The time has now come for fraternal refreshment and for harmony . `` Strange indeed is human nature . Here were these men , to whom murder was familiar , who again and again had struck down the father of the family , some man against whom they had no personal feeling , without one thought of compunction or of compassion for his weeping wife or helpless children , and yet the tender or pathetic in music could move them to tears . McMurdo had a fine tenor voice , and if he had failed to gain the good will of the lodge before , it could no longer have been withheld after he had thrilled them with `` I 'm Sitting on the Stile , Mary , '' and `` On the Banks of Allan Water . `` In his very first night the new recruit had made himself one of the most popular of the brethren , marked already for advancement and high office . There were other qualities needed , however , besides those of good fellowship , to make a worthy Freeman , and of these he was given an example before the evening was over . The whisky bottle had passed round many times , and the men were flushed and ripe for mischief when their Bodymaster rose once more to address them . `` Boys , '' said he , `` there 's one man in this town that wants trimming up , and it 's for you to see that he gets it . I 'm speaking of James Stanger of the Herald . You 've seen how he 's been opening his mouth against us again ? `` There was a murmur of assent , with many a muttered oath . McGinty took a slip of paper from his waistcoat pocket . `` LAW AND ORDER ! `` That 's how he heads it . `` REIGN OF TERROR IN THE COAL AND IRON DISTRICT '' Twelve years have now elapsed since the first assassinations which proved the existence of a criminal organization in our midst . From that day these outrages have never ceased , until now they have reached a pitch which makes us the opprobrium of the civilized world . Is it for such results as this that our great country welcomes to its bosom the alien who flies from the despotisms of Europe ? Is it that they shall themselves become tyrants over the very men who have given them shelter , and that a state of terrorism and lawlessness should be established under the very shadow of the sacred folds of the starry Flag of Freedom which would raise horror in our minds if we read of it as existing under the most effete monarchy of the East ? The men are known . The organization is patent and public . How long are we to endure it ? Can we forever live -- - '' Sure , I 've read enough of the slush ! '' cried the chairman , tossing the paper down upon the table . `` That 's what he says of us . The question I 'm asking you is what shall we say to him ? `` `` Kill him ! '' cried a dozen fierce voices . `` I protest against that , '' said Brother Morris , the man of the good brow and shaved face . `` I tell you , Brethren , that our hand is too heavy in this valley , and that there will come a point where in self-defense every man will unite to crush us out . James Stanger is an old man . He is respected in the township and the district . His paper stands for all that is solid in the valley . If that man is struck down , there will be a stir through this state that will only end with our destruction . `` `` And how would they bring about our destruction , Mr . Standback ? '' cried McGinty . `` Is it by the police ? Sure , half of them are in our pay and half of them afraid of us . Or is it by the law courts and the judge ? Have n't we tried that before now , and what ever came of it ? `` `` There is a Judge Lynch that might try the case , '' said Brother Morris.A general shout of anger greeted the suggestion . `` I have but to raise my finger , '' cried McGinty , `` and I could put two hundred men into this town that would clear it out from end to end . '' Then suddenly raising his voice and bending his huge black brows into a terrible frown , `` See here , Brother Morris , I have my eye on you , and have had for some time ! You 've no heart yourself , and you try to take the heart out of others . It will be an ill day for you , Brother Morris , when your own name comes on our agenda paper , and I 'm thinking that it 's just there that I ought to place it . `` Morris had turned deadly pale , and his knees seemed to give way under him as he fell back into his chair . He raised his glass in his trembling hand and drank before he could answer . `` I apologize , Eminent Bodymaster , to you and to every brother in this lodge if I have said more than I should . I am a faithful member -- -you all know that -- -and it is my fear lest evil come to the lodge which makes me speak in anxious words . But I have greater trust in your judgment than in my own , Eminent Bodymaster , and I promise you that I will not offend again . `` The Bodymaster 's scowl relaxed as he listened to the humble words . `` Very good , Brother Morris . It 's myself that would be sorry if it were needful to give you a lesson . But so long as I am in this chair we shall be a united lodge in word and in deed . And now , boys , '' he continued , looking round at the company , `` I 'll say this much , that if Stanger got his full deserts there would be more trouble than we need ask for . These editors hang together , and every journal in the state would be crying out for police and troops . But I guess you can give him a pretty severe warning . Will you fix it , Brother Baldwin ? '' '' Sure ! '' said the young man eagerly . `` How many will you take ? `` `` Half a dozen , and two to guard the door . You 'll come , Gower , and you , Mansel , and you , Scanlan , and the two Willabys . `` `` I promised the new brother he should go , '' said the chairman.Ted Baldwin looked at McMurdo with eyes which showed that he had not forgotten nor forgiven . `` Well , he can come if he wants , '' he said in a surly voice . `` That 's enough . The sooner we get to work the better . `` The company broke up with shouts and yells and snatches of drunken song . The bar was still crowded with revellers , and many of the brethren remained there . The little band who had been told off for duty passed out into the street , proceeding in twos and threes along the sidewalk so as not to provoke attention . It was a bitterly cold night , with a half-moon shining brilliantly in a frosty , star-spangled sky . The men stopped and gathered in a yard which faced a high building . The words , `` Vermissa Herald '' were printed in gold lettering between the brightly lit windows . From within came the clanking of the printing press . `` Here , you , '' said Baldwin to McMurdo , `` you can stand below at the door and see that the road is kept open for us . Arthur Willaby can stay with you . You others come with me . Have no fears , boys ; for we have a dozen witnesses that we are in the Union Bar at this very moment . `` It was nearly midnight , and the street was deserted save for one or two revellers upon their way home . The party crossed the road , and , pushing open the door of the newspaper office , Baldwin and his men rushed in and up the stair which faced them . McMurdo and another remained below . From the room above came a shout , a cry for help , and then the sound of trampling feet and of falling chairs . An instant later a gray-haired man rushed out on the landing.He was seized before he could get farther , and his spectacles came tinkling down to McMurdo 's feet . There was a thud and a groan . He was on his face , and half a dozen sticks were clattering together as they fell upon him . He writhed , and his long , thin limbs quivered under the blows . The others ceased at last ; but Baldwin , his cruel face set in an infernal smile , was hacking at the man 's head , which he vainly endeavoured to defend with his arms . His white hair was dabbled with patches of blood . Baldwin was still stooping over his victim , putting in a short , vicious blow whenever he could see a
