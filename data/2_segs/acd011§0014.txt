has come to a definite pause . `` Evening was drawing in when we reassembled . Holmes was very serious in his manner , myself curious , and the detectives obviously critical and annoyed . `` Well , gentlemen , '' said my friend gravely , `` I am asking you now to put everything to the test with me , and you will judge for yourselves whether the observations I have made justify the conclusions to which I have come . It is a chill evening , and I do not know how long our expedition may last ; so I beg that you will wear your warmest coats . It is of the first importance that we should be in our places before it grows dark ; so with your permission we shall get started at once . `` We passed along the outer bounds of the Manor House park until we came to a place where there was a gap in the rails which fenced it . Through this we slipped , and then in the gathering gloom we followed Holmes until we had reached a shrubbery which lies nearly opposite to the main door and the drawbridge . The latter had not been raised . Holmes crouched down behind the screen of laurels , and we all three followed his example . `` Well , what are we to do now ? '' asked MacDonald with some gruffness . `` Possess our souls in patience and make as little noise as possible , '' Holmes answered . `` What are we here for at all ? I really think that you might treat us with more frankness . `` Holmes laughed . `` Watson insists that I am the dramatist in real life , '' said he . `` Some touch of the artist wells up within me , and calls insistently for a well-staged performance . Surely our profession , Mr. Mac , would be a drab and sordid one if we did not sometimes set the scene so as to glorify our results . The blunt accusation , the brutal tap upon the shoulder -- -what can one make of such a denouement ? But the quick inference , the subtle trap , the clever forecast of coming events , the triumphant vindication of bold theories -- -are these not the pride and the justification of our life 's work ? At the present moment you thrill with the glamour of the situation and the anticipation of the hunt . Where would be that thrill if I had been as definite as a timetable ? I only ask a little patience , Mr. Mac , and all will be clear to you . `` `` Well , I hope the pride and justification and the rest of it will come before we all get our death of cold , '' said the London detective with comic resignation.We all had good reason to join in the aspiration ; for our vigil was a long and bitter one . Slowly the shadows darkened over the long , sombre face of the old house . A cold , damp reek from the moat chilled us to the bones and set our teeth chattering . There was a single lamp over the gateway and a steady globe of light in the fatal study . Everything else was dark and still . `` How long is this to last ? '' asked the inspector finally . `` And what is it we are watching for ? `` `` I have no more notion than you how long it is to last , '' Holmes answered with some asperity . `` If criminals would always schedule their movements like railway trains , it would certainly be more convenient for all of us . As to what it is we -- -Well , THAT 'S what we are watching for ! `` As he spoke the bright , yellow light in the study was obscured by somebody passing to and fro before it . The laurels among which we lay were immediately opposite the window and not more than a hundred feet from it . Presently it was thrown open with a whining of hinges , and we could dimly see the dark outline of a man 's head and shoulders looking out into the gloom . For some minutes he peered forth in furtive , stealthy fashion , as one who wishes to be assured that he is unobserved . Then he leaned forward , and in the intense silence we were aware of the soft lapping of agitated water . He seemed to be stirring up the moat with something which he held in his hand . Then suddenly he hauled something in as a fisherman lands a fish -- -some large , round object which obscured the light as it was dragged through the open casement. '' Now ! '' cried Holmes . `` Now ! `` We were all upon our feet , staggering after him with our stiffened limbs , while he ran swiftly across the bridge and rang violently at the bell . There was the rasping of bolts from the other side , and the amazed Ames stood in the entrance . Holmes brushed him aside without a word and , followed by all of us , rushed into the room which had been occupied by the man whom we had been watching.The oil lamp on the table represented the glow which we had seen from outside . It was now in the hand of Cecil Barker , who held it towards us as we entered . Its light shone upon his strong , resolute , clean-shaved face and his menacing eyes . `` What the devil is the meaning of all this ? '' he cried . `` What are you after , anyhow ? `` Holmes took a swift glance round , and then pounced upon a sodden bundle tied together with cord which lay where it had been thrust under the writing table . `` This is what we are after , Mr. Barker -- -this bundle , weighted with a dumb-bell , which you have just raised from the bottom of the moat . `` Barker stared at Holmes with amazement in his face . `` How in thunder came you to know anything about it ? '' he asked . `` Simply that I put it there . `` `` You put it there ! You ! `` `` Perhaps I should have said 'replaced it there , ' '' said Holmes . `` You will remember , Inspector MacDonald , that I was somewhat struck by the absence of a dumb-bell . I drew your attention to it ; but with the pressure of other events you had hardly the time to give it the consideration which would have enabled you to draw deductions from it . When water is near and a weight is missing it is not a very far-fetched supposition that something has been sunk in the water . The idea was at least worth testing ; so with the help of Ames , who admitted me to the room , and the crook of Dr. Watson 's umbrella , I was able last night to fish up and inspect this bundle . `` It was of the first importance , however , that we should be able to prove who placed it there . This we accomplished by the very obvious device of announcing that the moat would be dried to-morrow , which had , of course , the effect that whoever had hidden the bundle would most certainly withdraw it the moment that darkness enabled him to do so . We have no less than four witnesses as to who it was who took advantage of the opportunity , and so , Mr. Barker , I think the word lies now with you . `` Sherlock Holmes put the sopping bundle upon the table beside the lamp and undid the cord which bound it . From within he extracted a dumb-bell , which he tossed down to its fellow in the corner . Next he drew forth a pair of boots . `` American , as you perceive , '' he remarked , pointing to the toes . Then he laid upon the table a long , deadly , sheathed knife . Finally he unravelled a bundle of clothing , comprising a complete set of underclothes , socks , a gray tweed suit , and a short yellow overcoat . `` The clothes are commonplace , '' remarked Holmes , `` save only the overcoat , which is full of suggestive touches . '' He held it tenderly towards the light . `` Here , as you perceive , is the inner pocket prolonged into the lining in such fashion as to give ample space for the truncated fowling piece . The tailor 's tab is on the neck -- -'Neal , Outfitter , Vermissa , U.S.A. ' I have spent an instructive afternoon in the rector 's library , and have enlarged my knowledge by adding the fact that Vermissa is a flourishing little town at the head of one of the best known coal and iron valleys in the United States . I have some recollection , Mr. Barker , that you associated the coal districts with Mr. Douglas 's first wife , and it would surely not be too far-fetched an inference that the V.V . upon the card by the dead body might stand for Vermissa Valley , or that this very valley which sends forth emissaries of murder may be that Valley of Fear of which we have heard . So much is fairly clear . And now , Mr. Barker , I seem to be standing rather in the way of your explanation . `` It was a sight to see Cecil Barker 's expressive face during this exposition of the great detective . Anger , amazement , consternation , and indecision swept over it in turn . Finally he took refuge in a somewhat acrid irony . `` You know such a lot , Mr. Holmes , perhaps you had better tell us some more , '' he sneered . `` I have no doubt that I could tell you a great deal more , Mr. Barker ; but it would come with a better grace from you . `` `` Oh , you think so , do you ? Well , all I can say is that if there 's any secret here it is not my secret , and I am not the man to give it away . `` `` Well , if you take that line , Mr. Barker , '' said the inspector quietly , `` we must just keep you in sight until we have the warrant and can hold you . `` `` You can do what you damn please about that , '' said Barker defiantly.The proceedings seemed to have come to a definite end so far as he was concerned ; for one had only to look at that granite face to realize that no peine forte et dure would ever force him to plead against his will . The deadlock was broken , however , by a woman 's voice . Mrs. Douglas had been standing listening at the half opened door , and now she entered the room . `` You have done enough for now , Cecil , '' said she . `` Whatever comes of it in the future , you have done enough . `` `` Enough and more than enough , '' remarked Sherlock Holmes gravely . `` I have every sympathy with you , madam , and should strongly urge you to have some confidence in the common sense of
