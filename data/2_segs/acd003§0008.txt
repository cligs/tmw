the window , snib it on the inside , and get away in the way that he originally came . As a minor point it may be noted , '' he continued , fingering the rope , `` that our wooden-legged friend , though a fair climber , was not a professional sailor . His hands were far from horny . My lens discloses more than one blood-mark , especially towards the end of the rope , from which I gather that he slipped down with such velocity that he took the skin off his hand . `` `` This is all very well , '' said I , `` but the thing becomes more unintelligible than ever . How about this mysterious ally ? How came he into the room ? `` `` Yes , the ally ! '' repeated Holmes , pensively . `` There are features of interest about this ally . He lifts the case from the regions of the commonplace . I fancy that this ally breaks fresh ground in the annals of crime in this country , -- -though parallel cases suggest themselves from India , and , if my memory serves me , from Senegambia . `` `` How came he , then ? '' I reiterated . `` The door is locked , the window is inaccessible . Was it through the chimney ? `` `` The grate is much too small , '' he answered . `` I had already considered that possibility . `` `` How then ? '' I persisted . `` You will not apply my precept , '' he said , shaking his head . `` How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible whatever remains , HOWEVER IMPROBABLE , must be the truth ? We know that he did not come through the door , the window , or the chimney . We also know that he could not have been concealed in the room , as there is no concealment possible . Whence , then , did he come ? `` `` He came through the hole in the roof , '' I cried . `` Of course he did . He must have done so . If you will have the kindness to hold the lamp for me , we shall now extend our researches to the room above , -- -the secret room in which the treasure was found . `` He mounted the steps , and , seizing a rafter with either hand , he swung himself up into the garret . Then , lying on his face , he reached down for the lamp and held it while I followed him.The chamber in which we found ourselves was about ten feet one way and six the other . The floor was formed by the rafters , with thin lath-and-plaster between , so that in walking one had to step from beam to beam . The roof ran up to an apex , and was evidently the inner shell of the true roof of the house . There was no furniture of any sort , and the accumulated dust of years lay thick upon the floor . `` Here you are , you see , '' said Sherlock Holmes , putting his hand against the sloping wall . `` This is a trap-door which leads out on to the roof . I can press it back , and here is the roof itself , sloping at a gentle angle . This , then , is the way by which Number One entered . Let us see if we can find any other traces of his individuality . `` He held down the lamp to the floor , and as he did so I saw for the second time that night a startled , surprised look come over his face . For myself , as I followed his gaze my skin was cold under my clothes . The floor was covered thickly with the prints of a naked foot , -- -clear , well defined , perfectly formed , but scarce half the size of those of an ordinary man . `` Holmes , '' I said , in a whisper , `` a child has done the horrid thing . `` He had recovered his self-possession in an instant . `` I was staggered for the moment , '' he said , `` but the thing is quite natural . My memory failed me , or I should have been able to foretell it . There is nothing more to be learned here . Let us go down . `` `` What is your theory , then , as to those footmarks ? '' I asked , eagerly , when we had regained the lower room once more . `` My dear Watson , try a little analysis yourself , '' said he , with a touch of impatience . `` You know my methods . Apply them , and it will be instructive to compare results . `` `` I can not conceive anything which will cover the facts , '' I answered . `` It will be clear enough to you soon , '' he said , in an off-hand way . `` I think that there is nothing else of importance here , but I will look . '' He whipped out his lens and a tape measure , and hurried about the room on his knees , measuring , comparing , examining , with his long thin nose only a few inches from the planks , and his beady eyes gleaming and deep-set like those of a bird . So swift , silent , and furtive were his movements , like those of a trained blood-hound picking out a scent , that I could not but think what a terrible criminal he would have made had he turned his energy and sagacity against the law , instead of exerting them in its defense . As he hunted about , he kept muttering to himself , and finally he broke out into a loud crow of delight . `` We are certainly in luck , '' said he . `` We ought to have very little trouble now . Number One has had the misfortune to tread in the creosote . You can see the outline of the edge of his small foot here at the side of this evil-smelling mess . The carboy has been cracked , You see , and the stuff has leaked out . `` `` What then ? '' I asked . `` Why , we have got him , that 's all , '' said he . `` I know a dog that would follow that scent to the world 's end . If a pack can track a trailed herring across a shire , how far can a specially-trained hound follow so pungent a smell as this ? It sounds like a sum in the rule of three . The answer should give us the -- -But halloo ! here are the accredited representatives of the law . `` Heavy steps and the clamor of loud voices were audible from below , and the hall door shut with a loud crash . `` Before they come , '' said Holmes , `` just put your hand here on this poor fellow 's arm , and here on his leg . What do you feel ? `` `` The muscles are as hard as a board , '' I answered . `` Quite so . They are in a state of extreme contraction , far exceeding the usual rigor mortis . Coupled with this distortion of the face , this Hippocratic smile , or 'risus sardonicus , ' as the old writers called it , what conclusion would it suggest to your mind ? `` `` Death from some powerful vegetable alkaloid , '' I answered , -- - '' some strychnine-like substance which would produce tetanus . `` `` That was the idea which occurred to me the instant I saw the drawn muscles of the face . On getting into the room I at once looked for the means by which the poison had entered the system . As you saw , I discovered a thorn which had been driven or shot with no great force into the scalp . You observe that the part struck was that which would be turned towards the hole in the ceiling if the man were erect in his chair . Now examine the thorn . `` I took it up gingerly and held it in the light of the lantern . It was long , sharp , and black , with a glazed look near the point as though some gummy substance had dried upon it . The blunt end had been trimmed and rounded off with a knife . `` Is that an English thorn ? '' he asked . `` No , it certainly is not . `` `` With all these data you should be able to draw some just inference . But here are the regulars : so the auxiliary forces may beat a retreat . `` As he spoke , the steps which had been coming nearer sounded loudly on the passage , and a very stout , portly man in a gray suit strode heavily into the room . He was red-faced , burly and plethoric , with a pair of very small twinkling eyes which looked keenly out from between swollen and puffy pouches . He was closely followed by an inspector in uniform , and by the still palpitating Thaddeus Sholto . `` Here 's a business ! '' he cried , in a muffled , husky voice . `` Here 's a pretty business ! But who are all these ? Why , the house seems to be as full as a rabbit-warren ! `` `` I think you must recollect me , Mr. Athelney Jones , '' said Holmes , quietly . `` Why , of course I do ! '' he wheezed . `` It 's Mr. Sherlock Holmes , the theorist . Remember you ! I 'll never forget how you lectured us all on causes and inferences and effects in the Bishopgate jewel case . It 's true you set us on the right track ; but you 'll own now that it was more by good luck than good guidance . `` `` It was a piece of very simple reasoning . `` `` Oh , come , now , come ! Never be ashamed to own up . But what is all this ? Bad business ! Bad business ! Stern facts here , -- -no room for theories . How lucky that I happened to be out at Norwood over another case ! I was at the station when the message arrived . What d'you think the man died of ? `` `` Oh , this is hardly a case for me to theorize over , '' said Holmes , dryly . `` No , no . Still , we ca n't deny that you hit the nail on the head sometimes . Dear me ! Door locked , I understand . Jewels worth half a million missing . How was the window ? `` `` Fastened ; but there are steps on the sill . `` `` Well , well , if it was fastened the steps could have nothing to do with the matter . That 's common sense . Man might have died in a fit ; but then the jewels are missing . Ha ! I have a theory . These flashes come upon me at times. -- -Just step outside , sergeant , and you , Mr. Sholto . Your friend can remain. -- -What do you
