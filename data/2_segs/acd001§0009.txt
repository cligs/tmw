we found that the house belonged to a respectable paperhanger , named Keswick , and that no one of the name either of Sawyer or Dennis had ever been heard of there . `` `` You do n't mean to say , '' I cried , in amazement , `` that that tottering , feeble old woman was able to get out of the cab while it was in motion , without either you or the driver seeing her ? `` `` Old woman be damned ! '' said Sherlock Holmes , sharply . `` We were the old women to be so taken in . It must have been a young man , and an active one , too , besides being an incomparable actor . The get-up was inimitable . He saw that he was followed , no doubt , and used this means of giving me the slip . It shows that the man we are after is not as lonely as I imagined he was , but has friends who are ready to risk something for him . Now , Doctor , you are looking done-up . Take my advice and turn in . `` I was certainly feeling very weary , so I obeyed his injunction . I left Holmes seated in front of the smouldering fire , and long into the watches of the night I heard the low , melancholy wailings of his violin , and knew that he was still pondering over the strange problem which he had set himself to unravel.THE papers next day were full of the `` Brixton Mystery , '' as they termed it . Each had a long account of the affair , and some had leaders upon it in addition . There was some information in them which was new to me . I still retain in my scrap-book numerous clippings and extracts bearing upon the case . Here is a condensation of a few of them : -- -TheDaily Telegraphremarked that in the history of crime there had seldom been a tragedy which presented stranger features . The German name of the victim , the absence of all other motive , and the sinister inscription on the wall , all pointed to its perpetration by political refugees and revolutionists . The Socialists had many branches in America , and the deceased had , no doubt , infringed their unwritten laws , and been tracked down by them . After alluding airily to the Vehmgericht , aqua tofana , Carbonari , the Marchioness de Brinvilliers , the Darwinian theory , the principles of Malthus , and the Ratcliff Highway murders , the article concluded by admonishing the Government and advocating a closer watch over foreigners in England.TheStandardcommented upon the fact that lawless outrages of the sort usually occurred under a Liberal Administration . They arose from the unsettling of the minds of the masses , and the consequent weakening of all authority . The deceased was an American gentleman who had been residing for some weeks in the Metropolis . He had stayed at the boarding-house of Madame Charpentier , in Torquay Terrace , Camberwell . He was accompanied in his travels by his private secretary , Mr. Joseph Stangerson . The two bade adieu to their landlady upon Tuesday , the 4th inst. , and departed to Euston Station with the avowed intention of catching the Liverpool express . They were afterwards seen together upon the platform . Nothing more is known of them until Mr. Drebber 's body was , as recorded , discovered in an empty house in the Brixton Road , many miles from Euston . How he came there , or how he met his fate , are questions which are still involved in mystery . Nothing is known of the whereabouts of Stangerson . We are glad to learn that Mr. Lestrade and Mr. Gregson , of Scotland Yard , are both engaged upon the case , and it is confidently anticipated that these well-known officers will speedily throw light upon the matter.TheDaily Newsobserved that there was no doubt as to the crime being a political one . The despotism and hatred of Liberalism which animated the Continental Governments had had the effect of driving to our shores a number of men who might have made excellent citizens were they not soured by the recollection of all that they had undergone . Among these men there was a stringent code of honour , any infringement of which was punished by death . Every effort should be made to find the secretary , Stangerson , and to ascertain some particulars of the habits of the deceased . A great step had been gained by the discovery of the address of the house at which he had boarded -- -a result which was entirely due to the acuteness and energy of Mr. Gregson of Scotland Yard.Sherlock Holmes and I read these notices over together at breakfast , and they appeared to afford him considerable amusement . `` I told you that , whatever happened , Lestrade and Gregson would be sure to score . `` `` That depends on how it turns out . `` `` Oh , bless you , it does n't matter in the least . If the man is caught , it will beon accountof their exertions ; if he escapes , it will bein spiteof their exertions . It 's heads I win and tails you lose . Whatever they do , they will have followers . 'Un sot trouve toujours un plus sot qui l'admire . ' '' '' What on earth is this ? '' I cried , for at this moment there came the pattering of many steps in the hall and on the stairs , accompanied by audible expressions of disgust upon the part of our landlady . `` It 's the Baker Street division of the detective police force , '' said my companion , gravely ; and as he spoke there rushed into the room half a dozen of the dirtiest and most ragged street Arabs that ever I clapped eyes on. '' 'Tention ! '' cried Holmes , in a sharp tone , and the six dirty little scoundrels stood in a line like so many disreputable statuettes . `` In future you shall send up Wiggins alone to report , and the rest of you must wait in the street . Have you found it , Wiggins ? `` `` No , sir , we hai n't , '' said one of the youths . `` I hardly expected you would . You must keep on until you do . Here are your wages . '' 13 He handed each of them a shilling . `` Now , off you go , and come back with a better report next time . `` He waved his hand , and they scampered away downstairs like so many rats , and we heard their shrill voices next moment in the street . `` There 's more work to be got out of one of those little beggars than out of a dozen of the force , '' Holmes remarked . `` The mere sight of an official-looking person seals men 's lips . These youngsters , however , go everywhere and hear everything . They are as sharp as needles , too ; all they want is organisation . `` `` Is it on this Brixton case that you are employing them ? '' I asked . `` Yes ; there is a point which I wish to ascertain . It is merely a matter of time . Hullo ! we are going to hear some news now with a vengeance ! Here is Gregson coming down the road with beatitude written upon every feature of his face . Bound for us , I know . Yes , he is stopping . There he is ! `` There was a violent peal at the bell , and in a few seconds the fair-haired detective came up the stairs , three steps at a time , and burst into our sitting-room . `` My dear fellow , '' he cried , wringing Holmes ' unresponsive hand , `` congratulate me ! I have made the whole thing as clear as day . `` A shade of anxiety seemed to me to cross my companion 's expressive face . `` Do you mean that you are on the right track ? '' he asked . `` The right track ! Why , sir , we have the man under lock and key . `` `` And his name is ? `` `` Arthur Charpentier , sub-lieutenant in Her Majesty 's navy , '' cried Gregson , pompously , rubbing his fat hands and inflating his chest.Sherlock Holmes gave a sigh of relief , and relaxed into a smile . `` Take a seat , and try one of these cigars , '' he said . `` We are anxious to know how you managed it . Will you have some whiskey and water ? `` `` I do n't mind if I do , '' the detective answered . `` The tremendous exertions which I have gone through during the last day or two have worn me out . Not so much bodily exertion , you understand , as the strain upon the mind . You will appreciate that , Mr. Sherlock Holmes , for we are both brain-workers . `` `` You do me too much honour , '' said Holmes , gravely . `` Let us hear how you arrived at this most gratifying result . `` The detective seated himself in the arm-chair , and puffed complacently at his cigar . Then suddenly he slapped his thigh in a paroxysm of amusement . `` The fun of it is , '' he cried , `` that that fool Lestrade , who thinks himself so smart , has gone off upon the wrong track altogether . He is after the secretary Stangerson , who had no more to do with the crime than the babe unborn . I have no doubt that he has caught him by this time . `` The idea tickled Gregson so much that he laughed until he choked . `` And how did you get your clue ? `` `` Ah , I 'll tell you all about it . Of course , Doctor Watson , this is strictly between ourselves . The first difficulty which we had to contend with was the finding of this American 's antecedents . Some people would have waited until their advertisements were answered , or until parties came forward and volunteered information . That is not Tobias Gregson 's way of going to work . You remember the hat beside the dead man ? `` `` Yes , '' said Holmes ; `` by John Underwood and Sons , 129 , Camberwell Road . `` Gregson looked quite crest-fallen . `` I had no idea that you noticed that , '' he said . `` Have you been there ? '' '' No. '' '' Ha ! '' cried Gregson , in a relieved voice ; `` you should never neglect a chance , however small it may seem . `` `` To a great mind , nothing is little , '' remarked Holmes , sententiously . `` Well , I went to Underwood , and asked him if he had sold a hat of that size and description . He looked over his books , and came on it at once . He had sent the hat to a Mr. Drebber , residing at Charpentier 's Boarding Establishment , Torquay Terrace . Thus I got at his address . `` `` Smart -- -very smart ! '' murmured Sherlock Holmes . `` I next called upon Madame Charpentier
