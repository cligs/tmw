not know how the laws are over here . Maybe this sort of thing is not permitted . You will promise me that I shall have no trouble over the matter . `` `` None , none . Only pull me up ! `` `` Very good . Come along ! `` He dragged at the dragoon 's leg while the other gripped his way up the balustrade until , amid a buzz of congratulation from the crowd , he tumbled all in a heap over the rail on to the balcony , where he lay for a few moments as he had fallen . Then staggering to his feet , without a glance at his opponent , he rushed , with a bellow of rage , through the open window.While this little drama had been enacted overhead , the young guardsman had shaken off his first stupor of amazement , and had pushed his way through the crowd with such vigour that he and his companion had nearly reached the bottom of the steps . The uniform of the king 's guard was in itself a passport anywhere , and the face of old Catinat was so well known in the district that everyone drew back to clear a path for him towards his house . The door was flung open for them , and an old servant stood wringing his hands in the dark passage . `` Oh , master ! Oh , master ! '' he cried . `` Such doings , such infamy ! They will murder him ! `` `` Whom , then ? `` `` This brave monsieur from America . Oh , my God , hark to them now ! `` As he spoke , a clatter and shouting which had burst out again upstairs ended suddenly in a tremendous crash , with volleys of oaths and a prolonged bumping and smashing , which shook the old house to its foundations . The soldier and the Huguenot rushed swiftly up the first flight of stairs , and were about to ascend the second one , from the head of which the uproar seemed to proceed , when a great eight-day clock came hurtling down , springing four steps at a time , and ending with a leap across the landing and a crash against the wall , which left it a shattered heap of metal wheels and wooden splinters . An instant afterwards four men , so locked together that they formed but one rolling bundle , came thudding down amid adebrisof splintered stair-rails , and writhed and struggled upon the landing , staggering up , falling down , and all breathing together like the wind in a chimney . So twisted and twined were they that it was hard to pick one from the other , save that the innermost was clad in black Flemish cloth , while the three who clung to him were soldiers of the king . Yet so strong and vigorous was the man whom they tried to hold that as often as he could find his feet he dragged them after him from end to end of the passage , as a boar might pull the curs which had fastened on to his haunches . An officer , who had rushed down at the heels of the brawlers , thrust his hands in to catch the civilian by the throat , but he whipped them back again with an oath as the man 's strong white teeth met in his left thumb . Clapping the wound to his mouth , he flashed out his sword and was about to drive it through the body of his unarmed opponent , when De Catinat sprang forward and caught him by the wrist . `` You villain , Dalbert ! '' he cried.The sudden appearance of one of the king 's own bodyguard had a magic effect upon the brawlers . Dalbert sprang back , with his thumb still in his mouth , and his sword drooping , scowling darkly at the new-comer . His long sallow face was distorted with anger , and his small black eyes blazed with passion and with the hell-fire light of unsatisfied vengeance . His troopers had released their victim , and stood panting in a line , while the young man leaned against the wall , brushing the dust from his black coat , and looking from his rescuer to his antagonists . `` I had a little account to settle with you before , Dalbert , '' saidDe Catinat , unsheathing his rapier . `` I am on the king 's errand , '' snarled the other . `` No doubt . On guard , sir ! `` `` I am here on duty , I tell you ! `` `` Very good . Your sword , sir ! `` `` I have no quarrel with you. '' '' No ? '' De Catinat stepped forward and struck him across the face with his open hand . `` It seems to me that you have one now , '' said he . `` Hell and furies ! '' screamed the captain . `` To your arms , men ! Hola , there , from above ! Cut down this fellow , and seize your prisoner ! Hola ! In the king 's name ! `` At his call a dozen more troopers came hurrying down the stairs , while the three upon the landing advanced upon their former antagonist . He slipped by them , however , and caught out of the old merchant 's hand the thick oak stick which he carried . `` I am with you , sir , '' said he , taking his place beside the guardsman . `` Call off your canaille , and fight me like a gentleman , '' criedDe Catinat . `` A gentleman ! Hark to the bourgeois Huguenot , whose family peddles cloth ! `` `` You coward ! I will write liar on you with my sword-point ! `` He sprang forward , and sent in a thrust which might have found its way to Dalbert 's heart had the heavy sabre of a dragoon not descended from the side and shorn his more delicate weapon short off close to the hilt . With a shout of triumph , his enemy sprang furiously upon him with his rapier shortened , but was met by a sharp blow from the cudgel of the young stranger which sent his weapon tinkling on to the ground . A trooper , however , on the stair had pulled out a pistol , and clapping it within a foot of the guardsman 's head , was about to settle the combat , once and forever , when a little old gentleman , who had quietly ascended from the street , and who had been looking on with an amused and interested smile at this fiery sequence of events , took a sudden step forward , and ordered all parties to drop their weapons with a voice so decided , so stern , and so full of authority , that the sabre points all clinked down together upon the parquet flooring as though it were a part of their daily drill . `` Upon my word , gentlemen , upon my word ! '' said he , looking sternly from one to the other . He was a very small , dapper man , as thin as a herring , with projecting teeth and a huge drooping many-curled wig , which cut off the line of his skinny neck and the slope of his narrow shoulders . His dress was a long overcoat of mouse-coloured velvet slashed with gold , beneath which were high leather boots , which , with his little gold-laced , three-cornered hat , gave a military tinge to his appearance . In his gait and bearing he had a dainty strut and backward cock of the head , which , taken with his sharp black eyes , his high thin features , and his assured manner , would impress a stranger with the feeling that this was a man of power . And , indeed , in France or out of it there were few to whom this man 's name was not familiar , for in all France the only figure which loomed up as large as that of the king was this very little gentleman who stood now , with gold snuff-box in one hand , and deep-laced handkerchief in the other , upon the landing of the Huguenot 's house . For who was there who did not know the last of the great French nobles , the bravest of French captains , the beloved Conde , victor of Recroy and hero of the Fronde ? At the sight of his pinched , sallow face the dragoons and their leader had stood staring , while De Catinat raised the stump of his sword in a salute . `` Heh , heh ! '' cried the old soldier , peering at him . `` You were with me on the Rhine -- -heh ? I know your face , captain.But the household was with Turenne . `` `` I was in the regiment of Picardy , your Highness . De Catinat is my name . `` `` Yes , yes . But you , sir , who the devil are you ? `` `` Captain Dalbert , your Highness , of the Languedoc Blue Dragoons. '' '' Heh ! I was passing in my carriage , and I saw you standing on your head in the air . The young man let you up on conditions , as I understood . `` `` He swore he would go from the house , '' cried the young stranger . `` Yet when I had let him up , he set his men upon me , and we all came downstairs together . `` `` My faith , you seem to have left little behind you , '' said Conde , smiling , as he glanced at the litter which was strewed all over the floor . `` And so you broke your parole , Captain Dalbert ? `` `` I could not hold treaty with a Huguenot and an enemy of the king , '' said the dragoon sulkily . `` You could hold treaty , it appears , but not keep it . And why did you let him go , sir , when you had him at such a vantage ? `` `` I believed his promise . `` `` You must be of a trusting nature . `` `` I have been used to deal with Indians. '' '' Heh ! And you think an Indian 's word is better than that of an officer in the king 's dragoons ? `` `` I did not think so an hour ago. '' '' Hem ! '' Conde took a large pinch of snuff , and brushed the wandering grains from his velvet coat with his handkerchief of point . `` You are very strong , monsieur , '' said he , glancing keenly at the broad shoulders and arching chest of the young stranger . `` You are from Canada , I presume ? `` `` I have been there , sir . But I am from New York . `` Conde shook his head . `` An island ? `` `` No , sir ; a town . `` `` In what province ? `` `` The province of New York . `` `` The chief town , then ? `` `` Nay ; Albany is the chief town . `` `` And how came you to speak French ? `` `` My mother was of French blood . `` `` And how long have you been
