and swifter until the leaping waves closed over her high poop lantern . With one impulse the boat swept round again and made backwards as fast as willing arms could pull it . But all was quiet at the scene of the disaster . Not even a fragment of wreckage was left upon the surface to show where theGolden Rodhad found her last harbour . For a long quarter of an hour they pulled round and round in the moonlight , but not a glimpse could they see of the Puritan seaman , and at last , when in spite of the balers the water was washing round their ankles , they put her head about once more , and made their way in silence and with heavy hearts to their dreary island of refuge.Desolate as it was , it was their only hope now , for the leak was increasing and it was evident that the boat could not be kept afloat long . As they drew nearer they saw with dismay that the side which faced them was a solid wall of ice sixty feet high without a flaw or crevice in its whole extent . The berg was a large one , fifty paces at least each way , and there was a hope that the other side might be more favourable . Baling hard , they paddled round the corner , but only to find themselves faced by another gloomy ice-crag . Again they went round , and again they found that the berg increased rather than diminished in height . There remained only one other side , and they knew as they rowed round to it that their lives hung upon the result , for the boat was almost settling down beneath them . They shot out from the shadow into the full moonlight and looked upon a sight which none of them would forget until their dying day.The cliff which faced them was as precipitous as any of the others , and it glimmered and sparkled all over where the silver light fell upon the thousand facets of ice . Right in the centre , however , on a level with the water 's edge , there was what appeared to be a huge hollowed-out cave which marked the spot where the Golden Rod had , in shattering herself , dislodged a huge boulder , and so amid her own ruin prepared a refuge for those who had trusted themselves to her . This cavern was of the richest emerald green , light and clear at the edges , but toning away into the deepest purples and blues at the back . But it was not the beauty of this grotto , nor was it the assurance of rescue which brought a cry of joy and of wonder from every lip , but it was that , seated upon an ice boulder and placidly smoking a long corn-cob pipe , there was perched in front of them no less a person than Captain Ephraim Savage of Boston . For a moment the castaways could almost have believed that it was his wraith , were wraiths ever seen in so homely an attitude , but the tones of his voice very soon showed that it was indeed he , and in no very Christian temper either . `` Friend Tomlinson , '' said he , `` when I tell you to row for an iceberg I mean you to row right away there , d 'ye see , and not to go philandering about over the ocean . It 's not your fault that I 'm not froze , and so I would have been if I had n't some dry tobacco and my tinder-box to keep myself warm . `` Without stopping to answer his commander 's reproaches , the mate headed for the ledge , which had been cut into a slope by the bows of the brigantine , so that the boat was run up easily on to the ice . Captain Savage seized his dry clothes and vanished into the back of the cave , to return presently warmer in body , and more contented in mind . The long-boat had been turned upside down for a seat , the gratings and thwarts taken out and covered with wraps to make a couch for the lady , and the head knocked out of the keg of biscuits . `` We were frightened for you , Ephraim , '' said Amos Green . `` I had a heavy heart this night when I thought that I should never see you more . `` `` Tut , Amos , you should have known me better . `` `` But how came you here , captain ? '' asked Tomlinson . `` I thought that maybe you had been taken down by the suck of the ship . `` `` And so I was . It is the third ship in which I have gone down , but they have never kept me down yet . I went deeper to-night than when theSpeedwellsank , but not so deep as in theGovernor Winthrop . When I came up I swam to the berg , found this nook , and crawled in . Glad I was to see you , for I feared that you had foundered . `` `` We put back to pick you up and we passed you in the darkness . And what should we do now ? `` `` Rig up that boat-sail and make quarters for the gal . Then get our supper and such rest as we can , for there is nothing to be done to-night , and there may be much in the morning . `` Amos Green was aroused in the morning by a hand upon his shoulder , and springing to his feet , found De Catinat standing beside him . The survivors of the crew were grouped about the upturned boat , slumbering heavily after their labours of the night . The red rim of the sun had just pushed itself above the water-line , and sky and sea were one blaze of scarlet and orange from the dazzling gold of the horizon to the lightest pink at the zenith . The first rays flashed directly into their cave , sparkling and glimmering upon the ice crystals and tingeing the whole grotto with a rich warm light . Never was a fairy 's palace more lovely than this floating refuge which Nature had provided for them.But neither the American nor the Frenchman had time now to give a thought to the novelty and beauty of their situation . The latter 's face was grave , and his friend read danger in his eyes . `` What is it , then ? `` `` The berg . It is coming to pieces . `` `` Tut , man , it is as solid as an island . `` `` I have been watching it . You see that crack which extends backwards from the end of our grotto . Two hours ago I could scarce put my hand into it . Now I can slip through it with ease . I tell you that she is splitting across . `` Amos Green walked to the end of the funnel-shaped recess and found , as his friend had said , that a green sinuous crack extended away backwards into the iceberg , caused either by the tossing of the waves , or by the terrific impact of their vessel . He roused Captain Ephraim and pointed out the danger to him . `` Well , if she springs a leak we are gone , '' said he . `` She 's been thawing pretty fast as it is . `` They could see now that what had seemed in the moonlight to be smooth walls of ice were really furrowed and wrinkled like an old man 's face by the streams of melted water which were continually running down them . The whole huge mass was brittle and honeycombed and rotten . Already they could hear all round them the ominous drip , drip , and the splash and tinkle of the little rivulets as they fell into the ocean. '' Hullo ! '' cried Amos Green , `` what 's that ? `` `` What then ? `` `` Did you hear nothing ? '' '' No . `` `` I could have sworn that I heard a voice. '' '' Impossible . We are all here . `` `` It must have been my fancy then . `` Captain Ephraim walked to the seaward face of the cave and swept the ocean with his eyes . The wind had quite fallen away now , and the sea stretched away to the eastward , smooth and unbroken save for a single great black spar which floated near the spot where theGolden Rodhad foundered . `` We should lie in the track of some ships , '' said the captain thoughtfully . `` There 's the codders and the herring-busses . We 're over far south for them , I reckon . But we ca n't be more'n two hundred mile from Port Royal in Arcadia , and we 're in the line of the St. Lawrence trade . If I had three white mountain pines , Amos , and a hundred yards of stout canvas I 'd get up on the top of this thing , d 'ye see , and I 'd rig such a jury-mast as would send her humming into Boston Bay . Then I 'd break her up and sell her for what she was worth , and turn a few pieces over the business . But she 's a heavy old craft , and that 's a fact , though even now she might do a knot or two an hour if she had a hurricane behind her . But what is it , Amos ? `` The young hunter was standing with his ear slanting , his head bent forwards , and his eyes glancing sideways like a man who listens intently . He was about to answer when De Catinat gave a cry and pointed to the back of the cave . `` Look at the crack now . `` It had widened by a foot since they had noticed it last , until it was now no longer a crack . It was a pass . `` Let us go through , '' said the captain . `` It can but come out on the other side . `` `` Then let us see the other side . `` He led the way and the other two followed him . It was very dark as they advanced , with high dripping ice walls on either side and one little zigzagging slit of blue sky above their heads . Tripping and groping their way , they stumbled along until suddenly the passage grew wider and opened out into a large square of flat ice . The berg was level in the centre and sloped upwards from that point to the high cliffs which bounded it on each side . In three directions this slope was very steep , but in one it slanted up quite gradually , and the constant thawing had grooved the surface with a thousand irregularities by which an active man could ascend . With one impulse they began all three to clamber up until a minute later they were standing not far from the edge of the summit , seventy feet above the sea , with a view which took in a good fifty miles of water . In all that fifty miles there was no sign of life , nothing but the endless glint of the sun upon the waves.Captain Ephraim whistled .
