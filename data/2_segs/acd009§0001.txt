, I should attach weight to any results from her . `` `` I have never tried how far she is impressionable . Of course some people respond much more rapidly than others . May I ask how far your scepticism extends ? I suppose that you admit the mesmeric sleep and the power of suggestion . `` `` I admit nothing , Miss Penclosa . `` `` Dear me , I thought science had got further than that . Of course I know nothing about the scientific side of it . I only know what I can do . You see the girl in red , for example , over near the Japanese jar . I shall will that she come across to us . `` She bent forward as she spoke and dropped her fan upon the floor . The girl whisked round and came straight toward us , with an enquiring look upon her face , as if some one had called her . `` What do you think of that , Gilroy ? '' cried Wilson , in a kind of ecstasy.I did not dare to tell him what I thought of it . To me it was the most barefaced , shameless piece of imposture that I had ever witnessed . The collusion and the signal had really been too obvious . `` Professor Gilroy is not satisfied , '' said she , glancing up at me with her strange little eyes . `` My poor fan is to get the credit of that experiment . Well , we must try something else . Miss Marden , would you have any objection to my putting you off ? `` `` Oh , I should love it ! '' cried Agatha.By this time all the company had gathered round us in a circle , the shirt-fronted men , and the white-throated women , some awed , some critical , as though it were something between a religious ceremony and a conjurer 's entertainment . A red velvet arm-chair had been pushed into the centre , and Agatha lay back in it , a little flushed and trembling slightly from excitement . I could see it from the vibration of the wheat-ears . Miss Penclosa rose from her seat and stood over her , leaning upon her crutch.And there was a change in the woman . She no longer seemed small or insignificant . Twenty years were gone from her age . Her eyes were shining , a tinge of color had come into her sallow cheeks , her whole figure had expanded . So I have seen a dull-eyed , listless lad change in an instant into briskness and life when given a task of which he felt himself master . She looked down at Agatha with an expression which I resented from the bottom of my soul -- -the expression with which a Roman empress might have looked at her kneeling slave . Then with a quick , commanding gesture she tossed up her arms and swept them slowly down in front of her.I was watching Agatha narrowly . During three passes she seemed to be simply amused . At the fourth I observed a slight glazing of her eyes , accompanied by some dilation of her pupils . At the sixth there was a momentary rigor . At the seventh her lids began to droop . At the tenth her eyes were closed , and her breathing was slower and fuller than usual . I tried as I watched to preserve my scientific calm , but a foolish , causeless agitation convulsed me . I trust that I hid it , but I felt as a child feels in the dark . I could not have believed that I was still open to such weakness . `` She is in the trance , '' said Miss Penclosa . `` She is sleeping ! '' I cried . `` Wake her , then ! `` I pulled her by the arm and shouted in her ear . She might have been dead for all the impression that I could make . Her body was there on the velvet chair . Her organs were acting -- -her heart , her lungs . But her soul ! It had slipped from beyond our ken . Whither had it gone ? What power had dispossessed it ? I was puzzled and disconcerted . `` So much for the mesmeric sleep , '' said Miss Penclosa . `` As regards suggestion , whatever I may suggest Miss Marden will infallibly do , whether it be now or after she has awakened from her trance . Do you demand proof of it ? `` `` Certainly , '' said I . `` You shall have it . '' I saw a smile pass over her face , as though an amusing thought had struck her . She stooped and whispered earnestly into her subject 's ear . Agatha , who had been so deaf to me , nodded her head as she listened. '' Awake ! '' cried Miss Penclosa , with a sharp tap of her crutch upon the floor . The eyes opened , the glazing cleared slowly away , and the soul looked out once more after its strange eclipse.We went away early . Agatha was none the worse for her strange excursion , but I was nervous and unstrung , unable to listen to or answer the stream of comments which Wilson was pouring out for my benefit . As I bade her good-night Miss Penclosa slipped a piece of paper into my hand . `` Pray forgive me , '' said she , `` if I take means to overcome your scepticism . Open this note at ten o'clock to-morrow morning . It is a little private test . `` I ca n't imagine what she means , but there is the note , and it shall be opened as she directs . My head is aching , and I have written enough for to-night . To-morrow I dare say that what seems so inexplicable will take quite another complexion . I shall not surrender my convictions without a struggle.March 25 . I am amazed , confounded . It is clear that I must reconsider my opinion upon this matter . But first let me place on record what has occurred.I had finished breakfast , and was looking over some diagrams with which my lecture is to be illustrated , when my housekeeper entered to tell me that Agatha was in my study and wished to see me immediately . I glanced at the clock and saw with sun rise that it was only half-past nine.When I entered the room , she was standing on the hearth-rug facing me . Something in her pose chilled me and checked the words which were rising to my lips . Her veil was half down , but I could see that she was pale and that her expression was constrained . `` Austin , '' she said , `` I have come to tell you that our engagement is at an end . `` I staggered . I believe that I literally did stagger . I know that I found myself leaning against the bookcase for support . `` But -- -but -- -- -- '' I stammered . `` This is very sudden , Agatha . `` `` Yes , Austin , I have come here to tell you that our engagement is at an end . `` `` But surely , '' I cried , `` you will give me some reason ! This is unlike you , Agatha . Tell me how I have been unfortunate enough to offend you . `` `` It is all over , Austin . `` `` But why ? You must be under some delusion , Agatha . Perhaps you have been told some falsehood about me . Or you may have misunderstood something that I have said to you . Only let me know what it is , and a word may set it all right . `` `` We must consider it all at an end . `` `` But you left me last night without a hint at any disagreement . What could have occurred in the interval to change you so ? It must have been something that happened last night . You have been thinking it over and you have disapproved of my conduct . Was it the mesmerism ? Did you blame me for letting that woman exercise her power over you ? You know that at the least sign I should have interfered . `` `` It is useless , Austin . All is over : '' Her voice was cold and measured ; her manner strangely formal and hard . It seemed to me that she was absolutely resolved not to be drawn into any argument or explanation . As for me , I was shaking with agitation , and I turned my face aside , so ashamed was I that she should see my want of control . `` You must know what this means to me ! '' I cried . `` It is the blasting of all my hopes and the ruin of my life ! You surely will not inflict such a punishment upon me unheard . You will let me know what is the matter . Consider how impossible it would be for me , under any circumstances , to treat you so . For God 's sake , Agatha , let me know what I have done ! `` She walked past me without a word and opened the door . `` It is quite useless , Austin , '' said she . `` You must consider our engagement at an end . '' An instant later she was gone , and , before I could recover myself sufficiently to follow her , I heard the hall-door close behind her.I rushed into my room to change my coat , with the idea of hurrying round to Mrs. Marden 's to learn from her what the cause of my misfortune might be . So shaken was I that I could hardly lace my boots . Never shall I forget those horrible ten minutes . I had just pulled on my overcoat when the clock upon the mantel-piece struck ten.Ten ! I associated the idea with Miss Penclosa 's note . It was lying before me on the table , and I tore it open . It was scribbled in pencil in a peculiarly angular handwriting . `` MY DEAR PROFESSOR GILROY [ it said ] : Pray excuse the personal nature of the test which I am giving you . Professor Wilson happened to mention the relations between you and my subject of this evening , and it struck me that nothing could be more convincing to you than if I were to suggest to Miss Marden that she should call upon you at half-past nine to-morrow morning and suspend your engagement for half an hour or so . Science is so exacting that it is difficult to give a satisfying test , but I am convinced that this at least will be an action which she would be most unlikely to do of her own free will . Forget any thing that she may have said , as she has really nothing whatever to do with it , and will certainly not recollect any thing about it . I write this note to shorten your anxiety , and to beg you to forgive me for the momentary unhappiness which my suggestion must have caused you . `` Yours faithfully ; '' HELEN PENCLOSA.Really , when I had read the note , I was too relieved to be angry . It was a liberty . Certainly
