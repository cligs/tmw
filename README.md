tmw - Topic Modeling Workflow
=============================

This is the "simple" branch of tmw.

## What is tmw?

tmw is a python module for topic modeling, including some preprocessing of texts and some postprocessing of topic model data. This set of functions is experimental in nature and quality.

The SIMPLE version of tmw includes just the modules for postprocessing and visualization of topic modeling results. To run the modules, jupyter notebooks for postprocessing and visualization are included.

## Requirements

* tmw has been developed for and tested only on Linux (Ubuntu 14.04). tmw simple should in principle run on Windows and Mac, as well.
* Python 3 (tested with 3.4), Mallet (tested with 2.0.7).
* Python 3 packages numpy, pandas, matplotlib, lxml, scipy, seaborn, wordcloud, pygal.

## Usage

* Download the "tmw-simple" archive and unzip to a convenient location
* Open the jupyter notebooks Run_Postprocess.py and Run_Visualize.py and modify the settings according to your needs
* See also the twm tutorial: https://www.penflip.com/c.schoech/tmw-tutorial
