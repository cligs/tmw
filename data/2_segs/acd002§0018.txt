He had not understood , he said , that I was becoming attached to her , but when he saw with his own eyes that it was really so , and that she might be taken away from him , it gave him such a shock that for a time he was not responsible for what he said or did . He was very sorry for all that had passed , and he recognized how foolish and how selfish it was that he should imagine that he could hold a beautiful woman like his sister to himself for her whole life . If she had to leave him he had rather it was to a neighbour like myself than to anyone else . But in any case it was a blow to him and it would take him some time before he could prepare himself to meet it . He would withdraw all opposition upon his part if I would promise for three months to let the matter rest and to be content with cultivating the lady 's friendship during that time without claiming her love . This I promised , and so the matter rests . `` So there is one of our small mysteries cleared up . It is something to have touched bottom anywhere in this bog in which we are floundering . We know now why Stapleton looked with disfavour upon his sister 's suitor -- -even when that suitor was so eligible a one as Sir Henry . And now I pass on to another thread which I have extricated out of the tangled skein , the mystery of the sobs in the night , of the tear-stained face of Mrs. Barrymore , of the secret journey of the butler to the western lattice window . Congratulate me , my dear Holmes , and tell me that I have not disappointed you as an agent -- -that you do not regret the confidence which you showed in me when you sent me down . All these things have by one night 's work been thoroughly cleared.I have said `` by one night 's work , '' but , in truth , it was by two nights ' work , for on the first we drew entirely blank . I sat up with Sir Henry in his rooms until nearly three o'clock in the morning , but no sound of any sort did we hear except the chiming clock upon the stairs . It was a most melancholy vigil and ended by each of us falling asleep in our chairs . Fortunately we were not discouraged , and we determined to try again . The next night we lowered the lamp and sat smoking cigarettes without making the least sound . It was incredible how slowly the hours crawled by , and yet we were helped through it by the same sort of patient interest which the hunter must feel as he watches the trap into which he hopes the game may wander . One struck , and two , and we had almost for the second time given it up in despair when in an instant we both sat bolt upright in our chairs with all our weary senses keenly on the alert once more . We had heard the creak of a step in the passage.Very stealthily we heard it pass along until it died away in the distance . Then the baronet gently opened his door and we set out in pursuit . Already our man had gone round the gallery and the corridor was all in darkness . Softly we stole along until we had come into the other wing . We were just in time to catch a glimpse of the tall , black-bearded figure , his shoulders rounded as he tiptoed down the passage . Then he passed through the same door as before , and the light of the candle framed it in the darkness and shot one single yellow beam across the gloom of the corridor . We shuffled cautiously towards it , trying every plank before we dared to put our whole weight upon it . We had taken the precaution of leaving our boots behind us , but , even so , the old boards snapped and creaked beneath our tread . Sometimes it seemed impossible that he should fail to hear our approach . However , the man is fortunately rather deaf , and he was entirely preoccupied in that which he was doing . When at last we reached the door and peeped through we found him crouching at the window , candle in hand , his white , intent face pressed against the pane , exactly as I had seen him two nights before.We had arranged no plan of campaign , but the baronet is a man to whom the most direct way is always the most natural . He walked into the room , and as he did so Barrymore sprang up from the window with a sharp hiss of his breath and stood , livid and trembling , before us . His dark eyes , glaring out of the white mask of his face , were full of horror and astonishment as he gazed from Sir Henry to me . `` What are you doing here , Barrymore ? `` `` Nothing , sir . '' His agitation was so great that he could hardly speak , and the shadows sprang up and down from the shaking of his candle . `` It was the window , sir . I go round at night to see that they are fastened . `` `` On the second floor ? `` `` Yes , sir , all the windows . `` `` Look here , Barrymore , '' said Sir Henry sternly , `` we have made up our minds to have the truth out of you , so it will save you trouble to tell it sooner rather than later . Come , now ! No lies ! What were you doing at that window ? `` The fellow looked at us in a helpless way , and he wrung his hands together like one who is in the last extremity of doubt and misery . `` I was doing no harm , sir . I was holding a candle to the window . `` `` And why were you holding a candle to the window ? `` `` Do n't ask me , Sir Henry -- -do n't ask me ! I give you my word , sir , that it is not my secret , and that I can not tell it . If it concerned no one but myself I would not try to keep it from you . `` A sudden idea occurred to me , and I took the candle from the trembling hand of the butler . `` He must have been holding it as a signal , '' said I . `` Let us see if there is any answer . '' I held it as he had done , and stared out into the darkness of the night . Vaguely I could discern the black bank of the trees and the lighter expanse of the moor , for the moon was behind the clouds . And then I gave a cry of exultation , for a tiny pinpoint of yellow light had suddenly transfixed the dark veil , and glowed steadily in the centre of the black square framed by the window . `` There it is ! '' I cried . `` No , no , sir , it is nothing -- -nothing at all ! '' the butler broke in ; `` I assure you , sir -- - '' '' Move your light across the window , Watson ! '' cried the baronet . `` See , the other moves also ! Now , you rascal , do you deny that it is a signal ? Come , speak up ! Who is your confederate out yonder , and what is this conspiracy that is going on ? `` The man 's face became openly defiant . `` It is my business , and not yours . I will not tell . `` `` Then you leave my employment right away . `` `` Very good , sir . If I must I must . `` `` And you go in disgrace . By thunder , you may well be ashamed of yourself . Your family has lived with mine for over a hundred years under this roof , and here I find you deep in some dark plot against me . `` `` No , no , sir ; no , not against you ! '' It was a woman 's voice , and Mrs. Barrymore , paler and more horror-struck than her husband , was standing at the door . Her bulky figure in a shawl and skirt might have been comic were it not for the intensity of feeling upon her face . `` We have to go , Eliza . This is the end of it . You can pack our things , '' said the butler . `` Oh , John , John , have I brought you to this ? It is my doing , Sir Henry -- -all mine . He has done nothing except for my sake and because I asked him . `` `` Speak out , then ! What does it mean ? `` `` My unhappy brother is starving on the moor . We can not let him perish at our very gates . The light is a signal to him that food is ready for him , and his light out yonder is to show the spot to which to bring it . `` `` Then your brother is -- - '' '' The escaped convict , sir -- -Selden , the criminal . `` `` That 's the truth , sir , '' said Barrymore . `` I said that it was not my secret and that I could not tell it to you . But now you have heard it , and you will see that if there was a plot it was not against you . `` This , then , was the explanation of the stealthy expeditions at night and the light at the window . Sir Henry and I both stared at the woman in amazement . Was it possible that this stolidly respectable person was of the same blood as one of the most notorious criminals in the country ? `` Yes , sir , my name was Selden , and he is my younger brother . We humoured him too much when he was a lad and gave him his own way in everything until he came to think that the world was made for his pleasure , and that he could do what he liked in it . Then as he grew older he met wicked companions , and the devil entered into him until he broke my mother 's heart and dragged our name in the dirt . From crime to crime he sank lower and lower until it is only the mercy of God which has snatched him from the scaffold ; but to me , sir , he was always the little curly-headed boy that I had nursed and played with as an elder sister would . That was why he broke prison , sir . He knew that I was here and that we could not refuse to help him . When he dragged himself here one night , weary and starving , with the warders hard at his heels , what could we do ? We took him in and fed him and cared for him . Then you returned , sir , and my brother
