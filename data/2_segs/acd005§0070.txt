again in an instant andshook his hand defiantly at the window . `` Curse it ! '' cried Amos bitterly , in English . `` I have hit him with a spent ball . As well strike him with a pebble . `` `` Nay , curse not , Amos , lad , but try him again with another pinch of powder if your gun will stand it . `` The woodsman thrust in a full charge , and chose a well-rounded bullet from his bag , but when he looked again both the Bastard and his warriors had disappeared . On the river the single Iroquois canoe which held the captives was speeding south as swiftly as twenty paddles could drive it , but save this one dark streak upon the blue stream , not a sign was to be seen of their enemies . They had vanished as if they had been an evil dream . There was the bullet-spotted stockade , the litter of dead bodies inside it , the burned and roofless cottages , but the silent woods lay gleaming in the morning sunshine as quiet and peaceful as if no hell-burst of fiends had ever broken out from them . `` By my faith , I believe that they have gone ! '' cried the seigneur . `` Take care that it is not a ruse , '' said Du Lhut . `` Why should they fly before six men when they have conquered sixty ? `` But thecensitairehad looked out of the other window , and in an instant he was down upon his knees with his hands in the air , and his powder blackened face turned upwards , pattering out prayers and thanksgivings . His five comrades rushed across the room and burst into a shriek of joy . The upper reach of the river was covered with a flotilla of canoes from which the sun struck quick flashes as it shone upon the musket-barrels and trappings of the crews . Already they could see the white coats of the regulars , the brown tunics of the coureurs-de-bois\_ , and the gaudy colours of the Hurons and Algonquins . On they swept , dotting the whole breadth of the river , and growing larger every instant , while far away on the southern bend , the Iroquois canoe was a mere moving dot which had shot away to the farther side and lost itself presently under the shadow of the trees . Another minute and the survivors were out upon the bank , waving their caps in the air , while the prows of the first of their rescuers were already grating upon the pebbles . In the stern of the very foremost canoe sat a wizened little man with a large brown wig , and a gilt-headed rapier laid across his knees . He sprang out as the keel touched bottom , splashing through the shallow water with his high leather boots , and rushing up to the seigneur , he flung himself into his arms . `` My dear Charles , '' he cried , `` you have held your house like a hero.What , only six of you ! Tut , tut , this has been a bloody business ! `` `` I knew that you would not desert a comrade , Chambly . We have saved the house , but our losses have been terrible . My son is dead . My wife is in that Iroquois canoe in front of you . `` The commandant of Fort St. Louis pressed his friend 's hand in silent sympathy . `` The others arrived all safe , '' he said at last . `` Only that one was taken , on account of the breaking of a paddle . Three were drowned and two captured . There was a French lady in it , I understand , as well as madame . `` `` Yes , and they have taken her husband as well . `` `` Ah , poor souls ! Well , if you are strong enough to join us , you and your friends , we shall follow after them without the loss of an instant . Ten of my men will remain to guard the house , and you can have their canoe . Jump in then , and forward , for life and death may hang upon our speed ! `` The Iroquois had not treated De Catinat harshly when they dragged him from the water into their canoe . So incomprehensible was it to them why any man should voluntarily leave a place of safety in order to put himself in their power that they could only set it down to madness , a malady which inspires awe and respect among the Indians . They did not even tie his wrists , for why should he attempt to escape when he had come of his own free will ? Two warriors passed their hands over him , to be sure that he was unarmed , and he was then thrust down between the two women , while the canoe darted in towards the bank to tell the others that the St. Louis garrison was coming up the stream . Then it steered out again , and made its way swiftly up the centre of the river . Adele was deadly pale and her hand , as her husband laid his upon it , was as cold as marble . `` My darling , '' he whispered , `` tell me that all is well with you -- -that you are unhurt ! `` `` Oh , Amory , why did you come ? Why did you come , Amory ? Oh , I think I could have borne anything , but if they hurt you I could not bear that . `` `` How could I stay behind when I knew that you were in their hands ? I should have gone mad ! `` `` Ah , it was my one consolation to think that you were safe . `` `` No , no , we have gone through so much together that we can not part now.What is death , Adele ? Why should we be afraid of it ? `` `` I am not afraid of it . `` `` And I am not afraid of it . Things will come about as God wills it , and what He wills must in the end be the best . If we live , then we have this memory in common . If we die , then we go hand-in-hand into another life . Courage , my own , all will be well with us . `` `` Tell me , monsieur , '' said Onega , `` is my lord still living ? `` `` Yes , he is alive and well . `` `` It is good . He is a great chief , and I have never been sorry , not even now , that I have wedded with one who was not of my own people . But ah , my son ! Who shall give my son back to me ? He was like the young sapling , so straight and so strong ! Who could run with him , or leap with him , or swim with him ? Ere that sun shines again we shall all be dead , and my heart is glad , for I shall see my boy once more . `` The Iroquois paddles had bent to their work until a good ten miles lay between them and Sainte Marie . Then they ran the canoe into a little creek upon their own side of the river , and sprang out of her , dragging the prisoners after them . The canoe was carried on the shoulders of eight men some distance into the wood , where they concealed it between two fallen trees , heaping a litter of branches over it to screen it from view . Then , after a short council , they started through the forest , walking in single file , with their three prisoners in the middle . There were fifteen warriors in all , eight in front and seven behind , all armed with muskets and as swift-footed as deer , so that escape was out of the question . They could but follow on , and wait in patience for whatever might befall them.All day they pursued their dreary march , picking their way through vast morasses , skirting the borders of blue woodland lakes where the gray stork flapped heavily up from the reeds at their approach , or plunging into dark belts of woodland where it is always twilight , and where the falling of the wild chestnuts and the chatter of the squirrels a hundred feet above their heads were the only sounds which broke the silence . Onega had the endurance of the Indians themselves , but Adele , in spite of her former journeys , was footsore and weary before evening . It was a relief to De Catinat , therefore , when the red glow of a great fire beat suddenly through the tree-trunks , and they came upon an Indian camp in which was assembled the greater part of the war-party which had been driven from Sainte Marie . Here , too , were a number of the squaws who had come from the Mohawk and Cayuga villages in order to be nearer to the warriors . Wigwams had been erected all round in a circle , and before each of them were the fires with kettles slung upon a tripod of sticks in which the evening meal was being cooked . In the centre of all was a very fierce fire which had been made of brushwood placed in a circle , so as to leave a clear space of twelve feet in the middle . A pole stood up in the centre of this clearing , and something all mottled with red and black was tied up against it . De Catinat stepped swiftly in front of Adele that she might not see the dreadful thing , but he was too late . She shuddered , and drew a quick breath between her pale lips , but no sound escaped her . `` They have begun already , then , '' said Onega composedly . `` Well , it will be our turn next , and we shall show them that we know how to die . `` `` They have not ill-used us yet , '' said De Catinat . `` Perhaps they will keep us for ransom or exchange . `` The Indian woman shook her head . `` Do not deceive yourself by any such hope , '' said she . `` When they are as gentle as they have been with you it is ever a sign that you are reserved for the torture . Your wife will be married to one of their chiefs , but you and I must die , for you are a warrior , and I am too old for a squaw . `` Married to an Iroquois ! Those dreadful words shot a pang through both their hearts which no thought of death could have done . De Catinat 's head dropped forward upon his chest , and he staggered and would have fallen had Adele not caught him by the arm . `` Do not fear , dear Amory , '' she whispered . `` Other things may happen but not that , for I swear to you that I shall not survive you . No , it may be sin or it may not , but if death will not come to me , I will go to it . ``
