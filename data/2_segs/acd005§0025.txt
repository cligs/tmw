is a stranger from over the seas , from America , as I understand , who has stayed with him of late , and to whom Monsieur de Catinat has been showing the wonders of your Majesty 's palace . `` `` A stranger ! So much the better . Go , Bontems , and bring them both to me . `` `` I trust that they have not started , sire . I will see . '' He hurried off , and was back in ten minutes in the cabinet once more. '' Well ? `` `` I have been fortunate , sire . Their horses had been led out and their feet were in the stirrups when I reached them . `` `` Where are they , then ? `` `` They await your Majesty 's orders in the ante-room . `` `` Show them in , Bontems , and give admission to none , not even to the minister , until they have left me . `` To De Catinat an audience with the monarch was a common incident of his duties , but it was with profound astonishment that he learned from Bontems that his friend and companion was included in the order . He was eagerly endeavouring to whisper into the young American 's ear some precepts and warnings as to what to do and what to avoid , when Bontems reappeared and ushered them into the presence.It was with a feeling of curiosity , not unmixed with awe , that Amos Green , to whom Governor Dongan , of New York , had been the highest embodiment of human power , entered the private chamber of the greatest monarch in Christendom . The magnificence of the ante-chamber in which he had waited , the velvets , the paintings , the gildings , with the throng of gaily dressed officials and of magnificent guardsmen , had all impressed his imagination , and had prepared him for some wondrous figure robed and crowned , a fit centre for such a scene . As his eyes fell upon a quietly dressed , bright-eyed man , half a head shorter than himself , with a trim dapper figure , and an erect carriage , he could not help glancing round the room to see if this were indeed the monarch , or if it were some other of those endless officials who interposed themselves between him and the other world . The reverent salute of his companion , however , showed him that this must indeed be the king , so he bowed and then drew himself erect with the simple dignity of a man who has been trained in Nature 's school . `` Good-evening , Captain de Catinat , '' said the king , with a pleasant smile . `` Your friend , as I understand , is a stranger to this country . I trust , sir , that you have found something here to interest and to amuse you ? `` `` Yes , your Majesty . I have seen your great city , and it is a wonderful one . And my friend has shown me this palace , with its woods and its grounds . When I go back to my own country I will have much to say of what I have seen in your beautiful land . `` `` You speak French , and yet you are not a Canadian . `` `` No , sire ; I am from the English provinces . `` The king looked with interest at the powerful figure , the bold features , and the free bearing of the young foreigner , and his mind flashed back to the dangers which the Comte de Frontenac had foretold from these same colonies . If this were indeed a type of his race , they must in truth be a people whom it would be better to have as friends than as enemies . His mind , however , ran at present on other things than statecraft , and he hastened to give De Catinat his orders for the night . `` You will ride into Paris on my service . Your friend can go with you . Two are safer than one when they bear a message of state . I wish you , however , to wait until nightfall before you start . `` `` Yes , sire . `` `` Let none know your errand , and see that none follow you . You know the house of Archbishop Harlay , prelate of Paris ? `` `` Yes , sire . `` `` You will bid him drive out hither and be at the north-west side postern by midnight . Let nothing hold him back . Storm or fine , he must he here to-night . It is of the first importance . `` `` He shall have your order , sire . `` `` Very good . Adieu , captain . Adieu , monsieur . I trust that your stay in France may be a pleasant one . '' He waved his hand , smiling with the fascinating grace which had won so many hearts , and so dismissed the two friends to their new mission.Madame de Montespan still kept to her rooms , uneasy in mind at the king 's disappearance , but unwilling to show her anxiety to the court by appearing among them or by making any inquiry as to what had occurred . While she thus remained in ignorance of the sudden and complete collapse of her fortunes , she had one active and energetic agent who had lost no incident of what had occurred , and who watched her interests with as much zeal as if they were his own . And indeed they were his own ; for her brother , Monsieur de Vivonne , had gained everything for which he yearned , money , lands , and preferment , through his sister 's notoriety , and he well knew that the fall of her fortunes must be very rapidly followed by that of his own . By nature bold , unscrupulous , and resourceful , he was not a man to lose the game without playing it out to the very end with all the energy and cunning of which he was capable . Keenly alert to all that passed , he had , from the time that he first heard the rumour of the king 's intention , haunted the antechamber and drawn his own conclusions from what he had seen . Nothing had escaped him -- -the disconsolate faces of monsieur and of the dauphin , the visit of Pere la Chaise and Bossuet to the lady 's room , her return , the triumph which shone in her eyes as she came away from the interview . He had seen Bontems hurry off and summon the guardsman and his friend . He had heard them order their horses to be brought out in a couple of hours ' time , and finally , from a spy whom he employed among the servants , he learned that an unwonted bustle was going forward in Madame de Maintenon 's room , that Mademoiselle Nanon was half wild with excitement , and that two court milliners had been hastily summoned to madame 's apartment . It was only , however , when he heard from the same servant that a chamber was to be prepared for the reception that night of the Archbishop of Paris that he understood how urgent was the danger.Madame de Montespan had spent the evening stretched upon a sofa , in the worst possible humour with everyone around her . She had read , but had tossed aside the book . She had written , but had torn up the paper . A thousand fears and suspicions chased each other through her head . What had become of the king , then ? He had seemed cold yesterday , and his eyes had been for ever sliding round to the clock . And to-day he had not come at all . Was it his gout , perhaps ? Or was it possible that she was again losing her hold upon him ? Surely it could not be that ! She turned upon her couch and faced the mirror which flanked the door . The candles had just been lit in her chamber , two score of them , each with silver backs which reflected their light until the room was as bright as day . There in the mirror was the brilliant chamber , the deep red ottoman , and the single figure in its gauzy dress of white and silver . She leaned upon her elbow , admiring the deep tint of her own eyes with their long dark lashes , the white curve of her throat , and the perfect oval of her face . She examined it all carefully , keenly , as though it were her rival that lay before her , but nowhere could she see a scratch of Time 's malicious nails . She still had her beauty , then . And if it had once won the king , why should it not suffice to hold him ? Of course it would do so . She reproached herself for her fears . Doubtless he was indisposed , or perhaps he would come still . Ha ! there was the sound of an opening door and of a quick step in her ante-room . Was it he , or at least his messenger with a note from him ? But no , it was her brother , with the haggard eyes and drawn face of a man who is weighed down with his own evil tidings . He turned as he entered , fastened the door , and then striding across the room , locked the other one which led to her boudoir . `` We are safe from interruption , '' he panted . `` I have hastened here , for every second may be invaluable . Have you heard anything from the king ? '' '' Nothing . '' She had sprung to her feet , and was gazing at him with a face which was as pale as his own . `` The hour has come for action , Francoise . It is the hour at which the Mortemarts have always shown at their best . Do not yield to the blow , then , but gather yourself to meet it . `` `` What is it ? '' She tried to speak in her natural tone , but only a whisper came to her dry lips . `` The king is about to marry Madame de Maintenon . `` `` Thegouvernante ! The widow Scarron ! It is impossible ! `` `` It is certain . `` `` To marry ? Did you say to marry ? `` `` Yes , he will marry her . `` The woman flung out her hands in a gesture of contempt , and laughed loud and bitterly . `` You are easily frightened , brother , '' said she . `` Ah , you do not know your little sister . Perchance if you were not my brother you might rate my powers more highly . Give me a day , only one little day , and you will see Louis , the proud Louis , down at the hem of my dress to ask my pardon for this slight . I tell you that he can not break the bonds that hold him . One day is all I ask to bring him back . `` `` But you can not have it. '' '' What ? `` `` The marriage is to-night . `` `` You are mad , Charles . ``
