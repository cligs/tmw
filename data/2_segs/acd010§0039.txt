such a folly . Lord John , I trust that you will not countenance such madness ? `` `` Dooced ingenious , I call it , '' said our peer . `` I 'd like to see how it works . `` `` So you shall , '' said Challenger . `` For some days I have exerted my whole brain force upon the problem of how we shall descend from these cliffs . We have satisfied ourselves that we can not climb down and that there is no tunnel . We are also unable to construct any kind of bridge which may take us back to the pinnacle from which we came . How then shall I find a means to convey us ? Some little time ago I had remarked to our young friend here that free hydrogen was evolved from the geyser . The idea of a balloon naturally followed . I was , I will admit , somewhat baffled by the difficulty of discovering an envelope to contain the gas , but the contemplation of the immense entrails of these reptiles supplied me with a solution to the problem . Behold the result ! `` He put one hand in the front of his ragged jacket and pointed proudly with the other.By this time the gas-bag had swollen to a goodly rotundity and was jerking strongly upon its lashings . `` Midsummer madness ! '' snorted Summerlee.Lord John was delighted with the whole idea . `` Clever old dear , ai n't he ? '' he whispered to me , and then louder to Challenger . `` What about a car ? `` `` The car will be my next care . I have already planned how it is to be made and attached . Meanwhile I will simply show you how capable my apparatus is of supporting the weight of each of us . `` `` All of us , surely ? `` `` No , it is part of my plan that each in turn shall descend as in a parachute , and the balloon be drawn back by means which I shall have no difficulty in perfecting . If it will support the weight of one and let him gently down , it will have done all that is required of it . I will now show you its capacity in that direction . `` He brought out a lump of basalt of a considerable size , constructed in the middle so that a cord could be easily attached to it . This cord was the one which we had brought with us on to the plateau after we had used it for climbing the pinnacle . It was over a hundred feet long , and though it was thin it was very strong . He had prepared a sort of collar of leather with many straps depending from it . This collar was placed over the dome of the balloon , and the hanging thongs were gathered together below , so that the pressure of any weight would be diffused over a considerable surface . Then the lump of basalt was fastened to the thongs , and the rope was allowed to hang from the end of it , being passed three times round the Professor 's arm . `` I will now , '' said Challenger , with a smile of pleased anticipation , `` demonstrate the carrying power of my balloon . '' As he said so he cut with a knife the various lashings that held it.Never was our expedition in more imminent danger of complete annihilation . The inflated membrane shot up with frightful velocity into the air . In an instant Challenger was pulled off his feet and dragged after it . I had just time to throw my arms round his ascending waist when I was myself whipped up into the air . Lord John had me with a rat-trap grip round the legs , but I felt that he also was coming off the ground . For a moment I had a vision of four adventurers floating like a string of sausages over the land that they had explored . But , happily , there were limits to the strain which the rope would stand , though none apparently to the lifting powers of this infernal machine . There was a sharp crack , and we were in a heap upon the ground with coils of rope all over us . When we were able to stagger to our feet we saw far off in the deep blue sky one dark spot where the lump of basalt was speeding upon its way. '' Splendid ! '' cried the undaunted Challenger , rubbing his injured arm . `` A most thorough and satisfactory demonstration ! I could not have anticipated such a success . Within a week , gentlemen , I promise that a second balloon will be prepared , and that you can count upon taking in safety and comfort the first stage of our homeward journey . '' So far I have written each of the foregoing events as it occurred . Now I am rounding off my narrative from the old camp , where Zambo has waited so long , with all our difficulties and dangers left like a dream behind us upon the summit of those vast ruddy crags which tower above our heads . We have descended in safety , though in a most unexpected fashion , and all is well with us . In six weeks or two months we shall be in London , and it is possible that this letter may not reach you much earlier than we do ourselves . Already our hearts yearn and our spirits fly towards the great mother city which holds so much that is dear to us.It was on the very evening of our perilous adventure with Challenger 's home-made balloon that the change came in our fortunes . I have said that the one person from whom we had had some sign of sympathy in our attempts to get away was the young chief whom we had rescued . He alone had no desire to hold us against our will in a strange land . He had told us as much by his expressive language of signs . That evening , after dusk , he came down to our little camp , handed me ( for some reason he had always shown his attentions to me , perhaps because I was the one who was nearest his age ) a small roll of the bark of a tree , and then pointing solemnly up at the row of caves above him , he had put his finger to his lips as a sign of secrecy and had stolen back again to his people.I took the slip of bark to the firelight and we examined it together . It was about a foot square , and on the inner side there was a singular arrangement of lines , which I here reproduce : They were neatly done in charcoal upon the white surface , and looked to me at first sight like some sort of rough musical score . `` Whatever it is , I can swear that it is of importance to us , '' said I . `` I could read that on his face as he gave it . `` `` Unless we have come upon a primitive practical joker , '' Summerlee suggested , `` which I should think would be one of the most elementary developments of man . `` `` It is clearly some sort of script , '' said Challenger . `` Looks like a guinea puzzle competition , '' remarked Lord John , craning his neck to have a look at it . Then suddenly he stretched out his hand and seized the puzzle . `` By George ! '' he cried , `` I believe I 've got it . The boy guessed right the very first time . See here ! How many marks are on that paper ? Eighteen . Well , if you come to think of it there are eighteen cave openings on the hill-side above us . `` `` He pointed up to the caves when he gave it to me , '' said I . `` Well , that settles it . This is a chart of the caves . What ! Eighteen of them all in a row , some short , some deep , some branching , same as we saw them . It 's a map , and here 's a cross on it . What 's the cross for ? It is placed to mark one that is much deeper than the others . `` `` One that goes through , '' I cried . `` I believe our young friend has read the riddle , '' said Challenger . `` If the cave does not go through I do not understand why this person , who has every reason to mean us well , should have drawn our attention to it . But if it does go through and comes out at the corresponding point on the other side , we should not have more than a hundred feet to descend . `` `` A hundred feet ! '' grumbled Summerlee . `` Well , our rope is still more than a hundred feet long , '' I cried . `` Surely we could get down . `` `` How about the Indians in the cave ? '' Summerlee objected . `` There are no Indians in any of the caves above our heads , '' said I . `` They are all used as barns and store-houses . Why should we not go up now at once and spy out the land ? `` There is a dry bituminous wood upon the plateau -- -a species of araucaria , according to our botanist -- -which is always used by the Indians for torches . Each of us picked up a faggot of this , and we made our way up weed-covered steps to the particular cave which was marked in the drawing . It was , as I had said , empty , save for a great number of enormous bats , which flapped round our heads as we advanced into it . As we had no desire to draw the attention of the Indians to our proceedings , we stumbled along in the dark until we had gone round several curves and penetrated a considerable distance into the cavern . Then , at last , we lit our torches . It was a beautiful dry tunnel with smooth gray walls covered with native symbols , a curved roof which arched over our heads , and white glistening sand beneath our feet . We hurried eagerly along it until , with a deep groan of bitter disappointment , we were brought to a halt . A sheer wall of rock had appeared before us , with no chink through which a mouse could have slipped . There was no escape for us there.We stood with bitter hearts staring at this unexpected obstacle . It was not the result of any convulsion , as in the case of the ascending tunnel . The end wall was exactly like the side ones . It was , and had always been , a cul-de-sac . `` Never mind , my friends , '' said the indomitable Challenger . `` You have still my firm promise of a balloon . `` Summerlee groaned . `` Can we be in the wrong cave ? '' I suggested . `` No use , young fellah , '' said Lord John , with his finger on the chart . `` Seventeen from the right and second from the
