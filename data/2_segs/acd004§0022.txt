cry and whirr of wings.There were folk , too , to be met upon the road -- -beggars and couriers , chapmen and tinkers -- -cheery fellows for the most part , with a rough jest and homely greeting for each other and for Alleyne . Near Shotwood he came upon five seamen , on their way from Poole to Southampton -- -rude red-faced men , who shouted at him in a jargon which he could scarce understand , and held out to him a great pot from which they had been drinking -- -nor would they let him pass until he had dipped pannikin in and taken a mouthful , which set him coughing and choking , with the tears running down his cheeks . Further on he met a sturdy black-bearded man , mounted on a brown horse , with a rosary in his right hand and a long two-handed sword jangling against his stirrup-iron . By his black robe and the eight-pointed cross upon his sleeve , Alleyne recognized him as one of the Knights Hospitallers of St. John of Jerusalem , whose presbytery was at Baddesley . He held up two fingers as he passed , with a `` Benedic , fili mi ! `` whereat Alleyne doffed hat and bent knee , looking with much reverence at one who had devoted his life to the overthrow of the infidel . Poor simple lad ! he had not learned yet that what men are and what men profess to be are very wide asunder , and that the Knights of St. John , having come into large part of the riches of the ill-fated Templars , were very much too comfortable to think of exchanging their palace for a tent , or the cellars of England for the thirsty deserts of Syria . Yet ignorance may be more precious than wisdom , for Alleyne as he walked on braced himself to a higher life by the thought of this other 's sacrifice , and strengthened himself by his example which he could scarce have done had he known that the Hospitaller 's mind ran more upon malmsey than on Mamelukes , and on venison rather than victories.As he pressed on the plain turned to woods once more in the region of Wilverley Walk , and a cloud swept up from the south with the sun shining through the chinks of it . A few great drops came pattering loudly down , and then in a moment the steady swish of a brisk shower , with the dripping and dropping of the leaves . Alleyne , glancing round for shelter , saw a thick and lofty holly-bush , so hollowed out beneath that no house could have been drier . Under this canopy of green two men were already squatted , who waved their hands to Alleyne that he should join them . As he approached he saw that they had five dried herrings laid out in front of them , with a great hunch of wheaten bread and a leathern flask full of milk , but instead of setting to at their food they appeared to have forgot all about it , and were disputing together with flushed faces and angry gestures . It was easy to see by their dress and manner that they were two of those wandering students who formed about this time so enormous a multitude in every country in Europe . The one was long and thin , with melancholy features , while the other was fat and sleek , with a loud voice and the air of a man who is not to be gainsaid . `` Come hither , good youth , '' he cried , `` come hither ! Vultus ingenui puer . Heed not the face of my good coz here.Foenum habet in cornu , as Don Horace has it ; but I warrant him harmless for all that . `` `` Stint your bull 's bellowing ! '' exclaimed the other . `` If it come to Horace , I have a line in my mind : Loquaces si sapiat -- -- -- How doth it run ? The English o't being that a man of sense should ever avoid a great talker . That being so , if all were men of sense then thou wouldst be a lonesome man , coz. '' '' Alas ! Dicon , I fear that your logic is as bad as your philosophy or your divinity -- -and God wot it would be hard to say a worse word than that for it . For , hark ye : granting , propter argumentum , that I am a talker , then the true reasoning runs that since all men of sense should avoid me , and thou hast not avoided me , but art at the present moment eating herrings with me under a holly-bush , ergo you are no man of sense , which is exactly what I have been dinning into your long ears ever since I first clapped eyes on your sunken chops . `` `` Tut , tut ! '' cried the other . `` Your tongue goes like the clapper of a mill-wheel . Sit down here , friend , and partake of this herring . Understand first , however , that there are certain conditions attached to it . `` `` I had hoped , '' said Alleyne , falling into the humor of the twain , `` that a tranchoir of bread and a draught of milk might be attached to it . `` `` Hark to him , hark to him ! '' cried the little fat man . `` It is even thus , Dicon ! Wit , lad , is a catching thing , like the itch or the sweating sickness . I exude it round me ; it is an aura . I tell you , coz , that no man can come within seventeen feet of me without catching a spark . Look at your own case . A duller man never stepped , and yet within the week you have said three things which might pass , and one thing the day we left Fordingbridge which I should not have been ashamed of myself . `` `` Enough , rattle-pate , enough ! '' said the other . `` The milk you shall have and the bread also , friend , together with the herring , but you must hold the scales between us . `` `` If he hold the herring he holds the scales , my sapient brother , '' cried the fat man . `` But I pray you , good youth , to tell us whether you are a learned clerk , and , if so , whether you have studied at Oxenford or at Paris . `` `` I have some small stock of learning , '' Alleyne answered , picking at his herring , `` but I have been at neither of these places . I was bred amongst the Cistercian monks at Beaulieu Abbey . `` `` Pooh , pooh ! '' they cried both together . `` What sort of an upbringing is that ? '' '' Non cuivis contingit adire Corinthum , '' quoth Alleyne . `` Come , brother Stephen , he hath some tincture of letters , '' said the melancholy man more hopefully . `` He may be the better judge , since he hath no call to side with either of us . Now , attention , friend , and let your ears work as well as your nether jaw.Judex damnatur -- -you know the old saw . Here am I upholding the good fame of the learned Duns Scotus against the foolish quibblings and poor silly reasonings of Willie Ockham . `` `` While I , '' quoth the other loudly , `` do maintain the good sense and extraordinary wisdom of that most learned William against the crack-brained fantasies of the muddy Scotchman , who hath hid such little wit as he has under so vast a pile of words , that it is like one drop of Gascony in a firkin of ditch-water . Solomon his wisdom would not suffice to say what the rogue means . `` `` Certes , Stephen Hapgood , his wisdom doth not suffice , '' cried the other . `` It is as though a mole cried out against the morning star , because he could not see it . But our dispute , friend , is concerning the nature of that subtle essence which we call thought . For I hold with the learned Scotus that thought is in very truth a thing , even as vapor or fumes , or many other substances which our gross bodily eyes are blind to . For , look you , that which produces a thing must be itself a thing , and if a man 's thought may produce a written book , then must thought itself be a material thing , even as the book is . Have I expressed it ? Do I make it plain ? `` `` Whereas I hold , '' shouted the other , `` with my revered preceptor , doctor , praeclarus et excellentissimus , that all things are but thought ; for when thought is gone I prythee where are the things then ? Here are trees about us , and I see them because I think I see them , but if I have swooned , or sleep , or am in wine , then , my thought having gone forth from me , lo the trees go forth also . How now , coz , have I touched thee on the raw ? `` Alleyne sat between them munching his bread , while the twain disputed across his knees , leaning forward with flushed faces and darting hands , in all the heat of argument . Never had he heard such jargon of scholastic philosophy , such fine-drawn distinctions , such cross-fire of major and minor , proposition , syllogism , attack and refutation . Question clattered upon answer like a sword on a buckler . The ancients , the fathers of the Church , the moderns , the Scriptures , the Arabians , were each sent hurtling against the other , while the rain still dripped and the dark holly-leaves glistened with the moisture . At last the fat man seemed to weary of it , for he set to work quietly upon his meal , while his opponent , as proud as the rooster who is left unchallenged upon the midden , crowed away in a last long burst of quotation and deduction . Suddenly , however , his eyes dropped upon his food , and he gave a howl of dismay . `` You double thief ! '' he cried , `` you have eaten my herrings , and I without bite or sup since morning . `` `` That , '' quoth the other complacently , `` was my final argument , my crowning effort , orperoratio , as the orators have it . For , coz , since all thoughts are things , you have but to think a pair of herrings , and then conjure up a pottle of milk wherewith to wash them down . `` `` A brave piece of reasoning , '' cried the other , `` and I know of but one reply to it . '' On which , leaning forward , he caught his comrade a rousing smack across his rosy cheek . `` Nay , take it not amiss , '' he said , `` since all things are but thoughts , then that also is but a thought and may be disregarded . `` This last argument , however , by
