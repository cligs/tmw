in the affair . `` `` That is all right , '' I answered . `` But supposing anyone applies , I have no ring . `` `` Oh yes , you have , '' said he , handing me one . `` This will do very well . It is almost a facsimile . `` `` And who do you expect will answer this advertisement . `` `` Why , the man in the brown coat -- -our florid friend with the square toes . If he does not come himself he will send an accomplice . `` `` Would he not consider it as too dangerous ? `` `` Not at all . If my view of the case is correct , and I have every reason to believe that it is , this man would rather risk anything than lose the ring . According to my notion he dropped it while stooping over Drebber 's body , and did not miss it at the time . After leaving the house he discovered his loss and hurried back , but found the police already in possession , owing to his own folly in leaving the candle burning . He had to pretend to be drunk in order to allay the suspicions which might have been aroused by his appearance at the gate . Now put yourself in that man 's place . On thinking the matter over , it must have occurred to him that it was possible that he had lost the ring in the road after leaving the house . What would he do , then ? He would eagerly look out for the evening papers in the hope of seeing it among the articles found . His eye , of course , would light upon this . He would be overjoyed . Why should he fear a trap ? There would be no reason in his eyes why the finding of the ring should be connected with the murder . He would come . He will come . You shall see him within an hour ? `` `` And then ? '' I asked . `` Oh , you can leave me to deal with him then . Have you any arms ? `` `` I have my old service revolver and a few cartridges . `` `` You had better clean it and load it . He will be a desperate man , and though I shall take him unawares , it is as well to be ready for anything . `` I went to my bedroom and followed his advice . When I returned with the pistol the table had been cleared , and Holmes was engaged in his favourite occupation of scraping upon his violin . `` The plot thickens , '' he said , as I entered ; `` I have just had an answer to my American telegram . My view of the case is the correct one . `` `` And that is ? '' I asked eagerly . `` My fiddle would be the better for new strings , '' he remarked . `` Put your pistol in your pocket . When the fellow comes speak to him in an ordinary way . Leave the rest to me . Do n't frighten him by looking at him too hard . `` `` It is eight o'clock now , '' I said , glancing at my watch. '' Yes . He will probably be here in a few minutes . Open the door slightly . That will do . Now put the key on the inside . Thank you ! This is a queer old book I picked up at a stall yesterday -- -'De Jure inter Gentes ' -- -published in Latin at Liege in the Lowlands , in 1642 . Charles ' head was still firm on his shoulders when this little brown-backed volume was struck off . `` `` Who is the printer ? `` `` Philippe de Croy , whoever he may have been . On the fly-leaf , in very faded ink , is written 'Ex libris Guliolmi Whyte . ' I wonder who William Whyte was . Some pragmatical seventeenth century lawyer , I suppose . His writing has a legal twist about it . Here comes our man , I think . `` As he spoke there was a sharp ring at the bell . Sherlock Holmes rose softly and moved his chair in the direction of the door . We heard the servant pass along the hall , and the sharp click of the latch as she opened it . `` Does Dr. Watson live here ? '' asked a clear but rather harsh voice . We could not hear the servant 's reply , but the door closed , and some one began to ascend the stairs . The footfall was an uncertain and shuffling one . A look of surprise passed over the face of my companion as he listened to it . It came slowly along the passage , and there was a feeble tap at the door . `` Come in , '' I cried.At my summons , instead of the man of violence whom we expected , a very old and wrinkled woman hobbled into the apartment . She appeared to be dazzled by the sudden blaze of light , and after dropping a curtsey , she stood blinking at us with her bleared eyes and fumbling in her pocket with nervous , shaky fingers . I glanced at my companion , and his face had assumed such a disconsolate expression that it was all I could do to keep my countenance.The old crone drew out an evening paper , and pointed at our advertisement . `` It 's this as has brought me , good gentlemen , '' she said , dropping another curtsey ; `` a gold wedding ring in the Brixton Road . It belongs to my girl Sally , as was married only this time twelvemonth , which her husband is steward aboard a Union boat , and what he 'd say if he come 'ome and found her without her ring is more than I can think , he being short enough at the best o ' times , but more especially when he has the drink . If it please you , she went to the circus last night along with -- -- -- '' '' Is that her ring ? '' I asked . `` The Lord be thanked ! '' cried the old woman ; `` Sally will be a glad woman this night . That 's the ring . `` `` And what may your address be ? '' I inquired , taking up a pencil . `` 13 , Duncan Street , Houndsditch . A weary way from here . `` `` The Brixton Road does not lie between any circus and Houndsditch , '' said Sherlock Holmes sharply.The old woman faced round and looked keenly at him from her little red-rimmed eyes . `` The gentleman asked me for *my* address , '' she said . `` Sally lives in lodgings at 3 , Mayfield Place , Peckham . `` `` And your name is -- -- -- ? `` `` My name is Sawyer -- -her 's is Dennis , which Tom Dennis married her -- -and a smart , clean lad , too , as long as he 's at sea , and no steward in the company more thought of ; but when on shore , what with the women and what with liquor shops -- -- -- '' '' Here is your ring , Mrs. Sawyer , '' I interrupted , in obedience to a sign from my companion ; `` it clearly belongs to your daughter , and I am glad to be able to restore it to the rightful owner . `` With many mumbled blessings and protestations of gratitude the old crone packed it away in her pocket , and shuffled off down the stairs . Sherlock Holmes sprang to his feet the moment that she was gone and rushed into his room . He returned in a few seconds enveloped in an ulster and a cravat . `` I 'll follow her , '' he said , hurriedly ; `` she must be an accomplice , and will lead me to him . Wait up for me . '' The hall door had hardly slammed behind our visitor before Holmes had descended the stair . Looking through the window I could see her walking feebly along the other side , while her pursuer dogged her some little distance behind . `` Either his whole theory is incorrect , '' I thought to myself , `` or else he will be led now to the heart of the mystery . '' There was no need for him to ask me to wait up for him , for I felt that sleep was impossible until I heard the result of his adventure.It was close upon nine when he set out . I had no idea how long he might be , but I sat stolidly puffing at my pipe and skipping over the pages of Henri Murger 's `` Vie de Boh√®me . '' Ten o'clock passed , and I heard the footsteps of the maid as they pattered off to bed . Eleven , and the more stately tread of the landlady passed my door , bound for the same destination . It was close upon twelve before I heard the sharp sound of his latch-key . The instant he entered I saw by his face that he had not been successful . Amusement and chagrin seemed to be struggling for the mastery , until the former suddenly carried the day , and he burst into a hearty laugh . `` I would n't have the Scotland Yarders know it for the world , '' he cried , dropping into his chair ; `` I have chaffed them so much that they would never have let me hear the end of it . I can afford to laugh , because I know that I will be even with them in the long run . `` `` What is it then ? '' I asked . `` Oh , I do n't mind telling a story against myself . That creature had gone a little way when she began to limp and show every sign of being foot-sore . Presently she came to a halt , and hailed a four-wheeler which was passing . I managed to be close to her so as to hear the address , but I need not have been so anxious , for she sang it out loud enough to be heard at the other side of the street , 'Drive to 13 , Duncan Street , Houndsditch , ' she cried . This begins to look genuine , I thought , and having seen her safely inside , I perched myself behind . That 's an art which every detective should be an expert at . Well , away we rattled , and never drew rein until we reached the street in question . I hopped off before we came to the door , and strolled down the street in an easy , lounging way . I saw the cab pull up . The driver jumped down , and I saw him open the door and stand expectantly . Nothing came out though . When I reached him he was groping about frantically in the empty cab , and giving vent to the finest assorted collection of oaths that ever I listened to . There was no sign or trace of his passenger , and I fear it will be some time before he gets his fare . On inquiring at Number 13
