for , some little time , so they probably did not leave the house before a quarter past at the soonest . It is now half-past ten , so they have no very great start . You , Jamieson , and you , Van Muller , run out and find if three men have been seen getting away . Perhaps they took a buggy . Go up and down , and ask all you see . You , Jones , go as hard as you can to Inspector Ainslie . Tell him there has been robbery and attempted murder , and say that I want half a dozen of his best mounted men -- -not his best men , you understand , but his best horses . I shall see that he is no loser if he is smart . Where 's my servant Pete ? Pete , you dog , get my horse saddled and bring her round . She ought to be able to catch anything in Griqualand . `` As Ezra gave his orders the men hurried off in different directions to carry them out . He himself commenced to arrange his dress , and tied a handkerchief tightly round his head . `` Surely you are not going , sir ? '' the landlord said , `` You are not fit . `` `` Fit or not , I am going , '' Ezra said resolutely . `` If I have to be strapped to my horse I 'll go . Send me up some brandy . Put some in a flask , too . I may feel faint before I get back . `` A great concourse of people had assembled by this time , attracted by the report of the robbery . The whole square in front of the hotel was crowded with diggers and store-keepers and innumerable Kaffirs , all pressing up to the portico in the hope of hearing some fresh details . Mr. Hector O'Flaherty , over the way , was already busy setting up his type in preparation for a special edition , in which theVaal River Advertisershould give its version of the affair . In the office the great man himself , who was just convalescing from an attack of ardent spirits , was busily engaged , with a wet towel round his head , writing a leader upon the event . This production , which was very sonorous and effective , was peppered all over with such phrases as `` protection of property , '' `` outraged majesty of the law , '' and `` scum of civilization '' -- - expressions which had been used so continuously by Mr. O'Flaherty , that he had come to think that he had a copyright in them , and loudly accused the London papers of plagiarism if he happened to see them in their columns.There was a buzz of excitement among the crowd when Ezra appeared on the steps of the hotel , looking as white as a sheet , with a handkerchief bound round his head and his collar all crusted with blood . As he mounted his horse one of his emissaries rushed to him . `` If you please , sir , '' he said , `` they have taken the Capetown road . A dozen people saw them . Their horses were not up to much , for I know the man they got them from . You are sure to catch them . `` A smile played over Ezra 's pale face , which boded little good for the fugitives . `` Curse those police ! '' he cried ; `` are they never going to come ? `` `` Here they are ! '' said the landlord ; and sure enough , with a jingling of arms and a clatter of hoofs , half a dozen of the Griqualand Mounted Constabulary trotted through the crowd and drew up in front of the steps . They were smart , active young fellows , armed with revolver and sabre , and their horses were tough brutes , uncomely to look at , but with wonderful staying power . Ezra noted the fact with satisfaction as he rode up to the grizzled sergeant in command . `` There 's not a moment to be lost , sergeant , '' he said . `` They have an hour and a half 's start , but their cattle are not up to much . Come on ! It 's the Capetown road . A hundred pounds if we catch them ! '' '' Threes ! '' roared the sergeant . `` Right half turn -- -trot ! '' The crowd split asunder , and the little troop , with Ezra at their head , clove a path through them . `` Gallop ! '' shouted the sergeant , and away they clattered down the High Street of Kimberley , striking fire out of the stone and splashing up the gravel , until the sound of their hoofs died away into a dull , subdued rattle , and finally faded altogether from the ears of the listening crowd.For the first few miles the party galloped in silence . The moon was still shining brilliantly , and they could see the white line of the road stretching out in front of them and winding away over the undulating veldt . To right and left spread a broad expanse of wiry grass stretching to the horizon , with low bushes and scrub scattered over it in patches . Here and there were groups of long-legged , unhealthy-looking sheep , who crashed through the bushes in wild terror as the riders swept by them . Their plaintive calls were the only sounds which broke the silence of the night , save the occasional dismal hooting of the veldt owl.Ezra , on his powerful grey , had been riding somewhat ahead of the troopers , but the sergeant managed to get abreast of him . `` Beg pardon , sir , '' he said , raising his hand to his kepi , `` but do n't you think this pace is too good to last ? The horses will be blown . `` `` As long as we catch them , '' Ezra answered , `` I do n't care what becomes of the horses . I would sooner stand you a dozen horses apiece than let them get away . `` The young merchant 's words were firm and his seat steady , in spite of the throbbing at his head . The fury in his heart supplied him with strength , and he gnawed his moustache in his impatience and dug his spurs into his horse 's flanks until the blood trickled down its glossy coat . Fortune , reputation , above all , revenge , all depended upon the issue of this headlong chase through the darkness.The sergeant and Ezra galloped along , leather to leather , and rein to rein , while the troop clattered in their rear . `` There 's Combrink about two miles further on , '' said the sergeant ; `` we will hear news of them there . `` `` They ca n't get off the high road , can they ? `` `` Not likely , sir . They could n't get along as fast anywhere else . Indeed , it 's hardly safe riding across the veldt . They might be down a pit before they knew of it . `` `` As long as they are on the road , we must catch them , '' quoth Ezra ; `` for if it ran straight from here to hell I would follow them there . `` `` And we 'd stand by you , sir , '' said the sergeant , catching something of his companion 's enthusiasm . `` At this pace , if the horses hold out , we might catch them before morning . There are the lights of the shanty . `` As he spoke they were galloping round a long curve in the road , at the further end of which there was a feeble yellow glimmer . As they came abreast of it they saw that the light came through an open door , in the centre of which a burly Afrikaner was standing with his hands in his breeches pockets and his pipe in his mouth . `` Good evening , '' said the sergeant , as his men pulled up their reeking horses . `` Has any one passed this way before us ? `` `` Many a tausand has passed this way before you , '' said the Dutchman , taking his pipe out of his mouth to laugh . `` To-night , man , to-night ! '' the sergeant cried angrily . `` Oh yes ; down the Port Elizabeth Road there , not one hour ago . Three men riding fit to kill their horses . `` `` That 'll do , '' Ezra shouted ; and away they went once more down the broad white road . They passed Bluewater 's Drift at two in the morning , and were at Van Hayden 's farm at half-past . At three they left the Modder River far behind them , and at a quarter past four they swept down the main street of the little township of Jacobsdal , their horses weak and weary and all mottled with foam . There was a police patrol in the street . `` Has any one passed ? '' cried the sergeant . `` Three men , a quarter of an hour ago . `` `` Have they gone on ? `` `` Straight on . Their horses were nearly dead beat , though . `` `` Come on ! '' cried Ezra eagerly . `` Come on ! `` `` Four of the horses are exhausted , sir , '' said the sergeant . `` They ca n't move another step . `` `` Come on without them then . `` `` The patrol could come , '' the sergeant suggested . `` I should have to report myself at the office , sir , '' said the trooper . `` Jump on to his horse , sergeant , '' cried Ezra . `` He can take yours to report himself on . Now then you and I at least are bound to come up with them . Forward ! gallop ! '' And they started off once more on their wild career , rousing the quiet burghers of Jacobsdal by the wild turmoil of their hoofs.Out once more upon the Port Elizabeth Road it was a clear race between the pursuers and the pursued . The former knew that the fugitives , were it daytime , would possibly be within sight of them , and the thought gave them additional ardour . The sergeant having a fresh horse rode in front , his head down and his body forward , getting every possible inch of pace out of the animal . At his heels came Ezra , on his gallant grey , the blood-stained handkerchief fluttering from his head . He was sitting very straight in his saddle with a set stern smile upon his lips . In his right hand he held a cocked revolver . A hundred yards or so behind them the two remaining troopers came toiling along upon their weary nags , working hard with whip and spur to stimulate them to further exertions . Away in the east a long rosy streak lay low upon the horizon , which showed that dawn was approaching , and a grey light stole over the landscape . Suddenly the sergeant pulled his horse up . `` There 's some one coming towards us , '' he cried.Ezra and the troopers
