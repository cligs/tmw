The sulky dogs would rather have three twists of a rack , or the thumbikins for an hour , than pay out a denier for their own feudal father and liege lord . Yet there is not one of them but hath an old stocking full of gold pieces hid away in a snug corner . `` `` Why do they not buy food then ? '' asked Sir Nigel . `` By St. Paul ! it seemed to me their bones were breaking through their skin . `` `` It is their grutching and grumbling which makes them thin . We have a saying here , Sir Nigel , that if you pummel Jacques Bonhomme he will pat you , but if you pat him he will pummel you . Doubtless you find it so in England . `` `` Ma foi , no ! '' said Sir Nigel . `` I have two Englishmen of this class in my train , who are at this instant , I make little doubt , as full of your wine as any cask in your cellar . He who pummelled them might come by such a pat as he would be likely to remember . `` `` I can not understand it , '' quoth the seneschal , `` for the English knights and nobles whom I have met were not men to brook the insolence of the base born . `` `` Perchance , my fair lord , the poor folk are sweeter and of a better countenance in England , '' laughed the Lady Rochefort . `` Mon Dieu ! you can not conceive to yourself how ugly they are ! Without hair , without teeth , all twisted and bent ; for me , I can not think how the good God ever came to make such people . I can not bear it , I , and so my trusty Raoul goes ever before me with a cudgel to drive them from my path . `` `` Yet they have souls , fair lady , they have souls ! '' murmured the chaplain , a white-haired man with a weary , patient face . `` So I have heard you tell them , '' said the lord of the castle ; `` and for myself , father , though I am a true son of holy Church , yet I think that you were better employed in saying your mass and in teaching the children of my men-at-arms , than in going over the country-side to put ideas in these folks ' heads which would never have been there but for you . I have heard that you have said to them that their souls are as good as ours , and that it is likely that in another life they may stand as high as the oldest blood of Auvergne . For my part , I believe that there are so many worthy knights and gallant gentlemen in heaven who know how such things should be arranged , that there is little fear that we shall find ourselves mixed up with base roturiers and swine-herds . Tell your beads , father , and con your psalter , but do not come between me and those whom the king has given to me ! `` `` God help them ! '' cried the old priest . `` A higher King than yours has given them to me , and I tell you here in your own castle hall , Sir Tristram de Rochefort , that you have sinned deeply in your dealings with these poor folk , and that the hour will come , and may even now be at hand , when God 's hand will be heavy upon you for what you have done . '' He rose as he spoke , and walked slowly from the room . `` Pest take him ! '' cried the French knight . `` Now , what is a man to do with a priest , Sir Bertrand ? -- -for one can neither fight him like a man nor coax him like a woman . `` `` Ah , Sir Bertrand knows , the naughty one ! '' cried the Lady Rochefort . `` Have we not all heard how he went to Avignon and squeezed fifty thousand crowns out of the Pope . `` `` Ma foi ! '' said Sir Nigel , looking with a mixture of horror and admiration at Du Guesclin . `` Did not your heart sink within you ? Were you not smitten with fears ? Have you not felt a curse hang over you ? `` `` I have not observed it , '' said the Frenchman carelessly . `` But by Saint Ives ! Tristram , this chaplain of yours seems to me to be a worthy man , and you should give heed to his words , for though I care nothing for the curse of a bad pope , it would be a grief to me to have aught but a blessing from a good priest . `` `` Hark to that , my fair lord , '' cried the Lady Rochefort . `` Take heed , I pray thee , for I do not wish to have a blight cast over me , nor a palsy of the limbs . I remember that once before you angered Father Stephen , and my tire-woman said that I lost more hair in seven days than ever before in a month . `` `` If that be sign of sin , then , by Saint Paul ! I have much upon my soul , '' said Sir Nigel , amid a general laugh . `` But in very truth , Sir Tristram , if I may venture a word of counsel , I should advise that you make your peace with this good man . `` `` He shall have four silver candlesticks , '' said the seneschal moodily . `` And yet I would that he would leave the folk alone . You can not conceive in your mind how stubborn and brainless they are . Mules and pigs are full of reason beside them . God He knows that I have had great patience with them . It was but last week that , having to raise some money , I called up to the castle Jean Goubert , who , as all men know , has a casketful of gold pieces hidden away in some hollow tree . I give you my word that I did not so much as lay a stripe upon his fool 's back , but after speaking with him , and telling him how needful the money was to me , I left him for the night to think over the matter in my dungeon . What think you that the dog did ? Why , in the morning we found that he had made a rope from strips of his leathern jerkin , and had hung himself to the bar of the window . `` `` For me , I can not conceive such wickedness ! '' cried the lady . `` And there was Gertrude Le Boeuf , as fair a maiden as eye could see , but as bad and bitter as the rest of them . When young Amory de Valance was here last Lammastide he looked kindly upon the girl , and even spoke of taking her into his service . What does she do , with her dog of a father ? Why , they tie themselves together and leap into the Linden Pool , where the water is five spears'-lengths deep . I give you my word that it was a great grief to young Amory , and it was days ere he could cast it from his mind . But how can one serve people who are so foolish and so ungrateful ? `` Whilst the Seneschal of Villefranche had been detailing the evil doings of his tenants , Alleyne had been unable to take his eyes from the face of Lady Tiphaine . She had lain back in her chair , with drooping eyelids and bloodless face , so that he had feared at first her journey had weighed heavily upon her , and that the strength was ebbing out of her . Of a sudden , however , there came a change , for a dash of bright color flickered up on to either cheek , and her lids were slowly raised again upon eyes which sparkled with such lustre as Alleyne had never seen in human eyes before , while their gaze was fixed intently , not on the company , but on the dark tapestry which draped the wall . So transformed and so ethereal was her expression , that Alleyne , in his loftiest dream of archangel or of seraph , had never pictured so sweet , so womanly , and yet so wise a face . Glancing at Du Guesclin , Alleyne saw that he also was watching his wife closely , and from the twitching of his features , and the beads upon his brick-colored brow , it was easy to see that he was deeply agitated by the change which he marked in her . `` How is it with you , lady ? '' he asked at last , in a tremulous voice.Her eyes remained fixed intently upon the wall , and there was a long pause ere she answered him . Her voice , too , which had been so clear and ringing , was now low and muffled as that of one who speaks from a distance . `` All is very well with me , Bertrand , '' said she . `` The blessed hour of sight has come round to me again . `` `` I could see it come ! I could see it come ! '' he exclaimed , passing his fingers through his hair with the same perplexed expression as before . `` This is untoward , Sir Tristram , '' he said at last . `` And I scarce know in what words to make it clear to you , and to your fair wife , and to Sir Nigel Loring , and to these other stranger knights . My tongue is a blunt one , and fitter to shout word of command than to clear up such a matter as this , of which I can myself understand little . This , however , I know , that my wife is come of a very sainted race , whom God hath in His wisdom endowed with wondrous powers , so that Tiphaine Raquenel was known throughout Brittany ere ever I first saw her at Dinan . Yet these powers are ever used for good , and they are the gift of God and not of the devil , which is the difference betwixt white magic and black . `` `` Perchance it would be as well that we should send for Father Stephen , '' said Sir Tristram . `` It would be best that he should come , '' cried the Hospitaller . `` And bring with him a flask of holy water , '' added the knight of Bohemia . `` Not so , gentlemen , '' answered Sir Bertrand . `` It is not needful that this priest should be called , and it is in my mind that in asking for this ye cast some slight shadow or slur upon the good name of my wife , as though it were still doubtful whether her power came to her from above or below . If ye have indeed such a doubt I pray that you will say so , that we may discuss the matter in a fitting way . ``
