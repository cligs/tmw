which wafted to his ears the long-drawn stirring bugle-calls which sounded from the ancient ramparts . `` Hola , mon petit ! '' said Aylward , coming up to where he stood . `` Thou art a squire now , and like enough to win the golden spurs , while I am still the master-bowman , and master-bowman I shall bide . I dare scarce wag my tongue so freely with you as when we tramped together past Wilverley Chase , else I might be your guide now , for indeed I know every house in Bordeaux as a friar knows the beads on his rosary . `` `` Nay , Aylward , '' said Alleyne , laying his hand upon the sleeve of his companion 's frayed jerkin , `` you can not think me so thrall as to throw aside an old friend because I have had some small share of good fortune . I take it unkind that you should have thought such evil of me . `` `` Nay , mon gar . 'T was but a flight shot to see if the wind blew steady , though I were a rogue to doubt it . `` `` Why , had I not met you , Aylward , at the Lynhurst inn , who can say where I had now been ! Certes , I had not gone to Twynham Castle , nor become squire to Sir Nigel , nor met -- -- -- '' He paused abruptly and flushed to his hair , but the bowman was too busy with his own thoughts to notice his young companion 's embarrassment . `` It was a good hostel , that of the 'Pied Merlin , ' '' he remarked . `` By my ten finger bones ! when I hang bow on nail and change my brigandine for a tunic , I might do worse than take over the dame and her business . `` `` I thought , '' said Alleyne , `` that you were betrothed to some one at Christchurch . `` `` To three , '' Aylward answered moodily , `` to three . I fear I may not go back to Christchurch . I might chance to see hotter service in Hampshire than I have ever done in Gascony . But mark you now yonder lofty turret in the centre , which stands back from the river and hath a broad banner upon the summit . See the rising sun flashes full upon it and sparkles on the golden lions . 'T is the royal banner of England , crossed by the prince 's label . There he dwells in the Abbey of St. Andrew , where he hath kept his court these years back . Beside it is the minster of the same saint , who hath the town under his very special care . `` `` And how of yon gray turret on the left ? `` `` 'T is the fane of St. Michael , as that upon the right is of St. Remi . There , too , above the poop of yonder nief , you see the towers of Saint Croix and of Pey Berland . Mark also the mighty ramparts which are pierced by the three water-gates , and sixteen others to the landward side . `` `` And how is it , good Aylward , that there comes so much music from the town ? I seem to hear a hundred trumpets , all calling in chorus . `` `` It would be strange else , seeing that all the great lords of England and of Gascony are within the walls , and each would have his trumpeter blow as loud as his neighbor , lest it might be thought that his dignity had been abated . Ma foi ! they make as much louster as a Scotch army , where every man fills himself with girdle-cakes , and sits up all night to blow upon the toodle-pipe . See all along the banks how the pages water the horses , and there beyond the town how they gallop them over the plain ! For every horse you see a belted knight hath herbergage in the town , for , as I learn , the men-at-arms and archers have already gone forward to Dax . `` `` I trust , Aylward , '' said Sir Nigel , coming upon deck , `` that the men are ready for the land . Go tell them that the boats will be for them within the hour . `` The archer raised his hand in salute , and hastened forward . In the meantime Sir Oliver had followed his brother knight , and the two paced the poop together , Sir Nigel in his plum-colored velvet suit with flat cap of the same , adorned in front with the Lady Loring 's glove and girt round with a curling ostrich feather . The lusty knight , on the other hand , was clad in the very latest mode , with cote-hardie , doublet , pourpoint , court-pie , and paltock of olive-green , picked out with pink and jagged at the edges . A red chaperon or cap , with long hanging cornette , sat daintily on the back of his black-curled head , while his gold-hued shoes were twisted upa la poulaine , as though the toes were shooting forth a tendril which might hope in time to entwine itself around his massive leg . `` Once more , Sir Oliver , '' said Sir Nigel , looking shorewards with sparkling eyes , `` do we find ourselves at the gate of honor , the door which hath so often led us to all that is knightly and worthy . There flies the prince 's banner , and it would be well that we haste ashore and pay our obeisance to him . The boats already swarm from the bank . `` `` There is a goodly hostel near the west gate , which is famed for the stewing of spiced pullets , '' remarked Sir Oliver . `` We might take the edge of our hunger off ere we seek the prince , for though his tables are gay with damask and silver he is no trencherman himself , and hath no sympathy for those who are his betters . `` `` His betters ! `` `` His betters before the tranchoir , lad . Sniff not treason where none is meant . I have seen him smile in his quiet way because I had looked for the fourth time towards the carving squire . And indeed to watch him dallying with a little gobbet of bread , or sipping his cup of thrice-watered wine , is enough to make a man feel shame at his own hunger . Yet war and glory , my good friend , though well enough in their way , will not serve to tighten such a belt as clasps my waist . `` `` How read you that coat which hangs over yonder galley , Alleyne ? '' asked Sir Nigel . `` Argent , a bend vert between cotises dancette gules . `` `` It is a northern coat . I have seen it in the train of the Percies . From the shields , there is not one of these vessels which hath not knight or baron aboard . I would mine eyes were better . How read you this upon the left ? `` `` Argent and azure , a barry wavy of six . `` `` Ha , it is the sign of the Wiltshire Stourtons ! And there beyond I see the red and silver of the Worsleys of Apuldercombe , who like myself are of Hampshire lineage . Close behind us is the moline cross of the gallant William Molyneux , and beside it the bloody chevrons of the Norfork Woodhouses , with the amulets of the Musgraves of Westmoreland . By St. Paul ! it would be a very strange thing if so noble a company were to gather without some notable deed of arms arising from it . And here is our boat , Sir Oliver , so it seems best to me that we should go to the abbey with our squires , leaving Master Hawtayne to have his own way in the unloading . `` The horses both of knights and squires were speedily lowered into a broad lighter , and reached the shore almost as soon as their masters . Sir Nigel bent his knee devoutly as he put foot on land , and taking a small black patch from his bosom he bound it tightly over his left eye . `` May the blessed George and the memory of my sweet lady-love raise high my heart ! '' quoth he . `` And as a token I vow that I will not take this patch from my eye until I have seen something of this country of Spain , and done such a small deed as it lies in me to do . And this I swear upon the cross of my sword and upon the glove of my lady . `` `` In truth , you take me back twenty years , Nigel , '' quoth Sir Oliver , as they mounted and rode slowly through the water-gate . `` After Cadsand , I deem that the French thought that we were an army of the blind , for there was scarce a man who had not closed an eye for the greater love and honor of his lady . Yet it goes hard with you that you should darken one side , when with both open you can scarce tell a horse from a mule . In truth , friend , I think that you step over the line of reason in this matter . `` `` Sir Oliver Buttesthorn , '' said the little knight shortly , `` I would have you to understand that , blind as I am , I can yet see the path of honor very clearly , and that that is the road upon which I do not crave another man 's guidance . `` `` By my soul , '' said Sir Oliver , `` you are as tart as verjuice this morning ! If you are bent upon a quarrel with me I must leave you to your humor and drop into the 'Tete d'Or ' here , for I marked a varlet pass the door who bare a smoking dish , which had , methought , a most excellent smell . `` `` Nenny , nenny , '' cried his comrade , laying his hand upon his knee ; `` we have known each other over long to fall out , Oliver , like two raw pages at their first epreuves . You must come with me first to the prince , and then back to the hostel ; though sure I am that it would grieve his heart that any gentle cavalier should turn from his board to a common tavern . But is not that my Lord Delewar who waves to us ? Ha ! my fair lord , God and Our Lady be with you ! And there is Sir Robert Cheney . Good-morrow , Robert ! I am right glad to see you . `` The two knights walked their horses abreast , while Alleyne and Ford , with John Norbury , who was squire to Sir Oliver , kept some paces behind them , a spear's-length in front of Black Simon and of the Winchester guidon-bearer . Norbury , a lean , silent man , had been to those parts before , and sat his horse with a rigid neck ; but the two young squires gazed eagerly to right or
