him in that inhospitable abode . Was he our malignant enemy , or was he by chance our guardian angel ? I swore that I would not leave the hut until I knew.Outside the sun was sinking low and the west was blazing with scarlet and gold . Its reflection was shot back in ruddy patches by the distant pools which lay amid the great Grimpen Mire . There were the two towers of Baskerville Hall , and there a distant blur of smoke which marked the village of Grimpen . Between the two , behind the hill , was the house of the Stapletons . All was sweet and mellow and peaceful in the golden evening light , and yet as I looked at them my soul shared none of the peace of Nature but quivered at the vagueness and the terror of that interview which every instant was bringing nearer . With tingling nerves but a fixed purpose , I sat in the dark recess of the hut and waited with sombre patience for the coming of its tenant.And then at last I heard him . Far away came the sharp clink of a boot striking upon a stone . Then another and yet another , coming nearer and nearer . I shrank back into the darkest corner and cocked the pistol in my pocket , determined not to discover myself until I had an opportunity of seeing something of the stranger . There was a long pause which showed that he had stopped . Then once more the footsteps approached and a shadow fell across the opening of the hut . `` It is a lovely evening , my dear Watson , '' said a well-known voice . `` I really think that you will be more comfortable outside than in . `` For a moment or two I sat breathless , hardly able to believe my ears . Then my senses and my voice came back to me , while a crushing weight of responsibility seemed in an instant to be lifted from my soul . That cold , incisive , ironical voice could belong to but one man in all the world. '' Holmes ! '' I cried -- - '' Holmes ! `` `` Come out , '' said he , `` and please be careful with the revolver . `` I stooped under the rude lintel , and there he sat upon a stone outside , his gray eyes dancing with amusement as they fell upon my astonished features . He was thin and worn , but clear and alert , his keen face bronzed by the sun and roughened by the wind . In his tweed suit and cloth cap he looked like any other tourist upon the moor , and he had contrived , with that catlike love of personal cleanliness which was one of his characteristics , that his chin should be as smooth and his linen as perfect as if he were in Baker Street . `` I never was more glad to see anyone in my life , '' said I as I wrung him by the hand . `` Or more astonished , eh ? `` `` Well , I must confess to it . `` `` The surprise was not all on one side , I assure you . I had no idea that you had found my occasional retreat , still less that you were inside it , until I was within twenty paces of the door . `` `` My footprint , I presume ? `` `` No , Watson , I fear that I could not undertake to recognize your footprint amid all the footprints of the world . If you seriously desire to deceive me you must change your tobacconist ; for when I see the stub of a cigarette marked Bradley , Oxford Street , I know that my friend Watson is in the neighbourhood . You will see it there beside the path . You threw it down , no doubt , at that supreme moment when you charged into the empty hut. '' '' Exactly . `` `` I thought as much -- -and knowing your admirable tenacity I was convinced that you were sitting in ambush , a weapon within reach , waiting for the tenant to return . So you actually thought that I was the criminal ? `` `` I did not know who you were , but I was determined to find out . `` `` Excellent , Watson ! And how did you localize me ? You saw me , perhaps , on the night of the convict hunt , when I was so imprudent as to allow the moon to rise behind me ? `` `` Yes , I saw you then . `` `` And have no doubt searched all the huts until you came to this one ? `` `` No , your boy had been observed , and that gave me a guide where to look . `` `` The old gentleman with the telescope , no doubt . I could not make it out when first I saw the light flashing upon the lens . '' He rose and peeped into the hut . `` Ha , I see that Cartwright has brought up some supplies . What 's this paper ? So you have been to Coombe Tracey , have you ? '' '' Yes . `` `` To see Mrs. Laura Lyons ? '' '' Exactly . `` `` Well done ! Our researches have evidently been running on parallel lines , and when we unite our results I expect we shall have a fairly full knowledge of the case . `` `` Well , I am glad from my heart that you are here , for indeed the responsibility and the mystery were both becoming too much for my nerves . But how in the name of wonder did you come here , and what have you been doing ? I thought that you were in Baker Street working out that case of blackmailing . `` `` That was what I wished you to think . `` `` Then you use me , and yet do not trust me ! '' I cried with some bitterness . `` I think that I have deserved better at your hands , Holmes . `` `` My dear fellow , you have been invaluable to me in this as in many other cases , and I beg that you will forgive me if I have seemed to play a trick upon you . In truth , it was partly for your own sake that I did it , and it was my appreciation of the danger which you ran which led me to come down and examine the matter for myself . Had I been with Sir Henry and you it is confident that my point of view would have been the same as yours , and my presence would have warned our very formidable opponents to be on their guard . As it is , I have been able to get about as I could not possibly have done had I been living in the Hall , and I remain an unknown factor in the business , ready to throw in all my weight at a critical moment . `` `` But why keep me in the dark ? `` `` For you to know could not have helped us and might possibly have led to my discovery . You would have wished to tell me something , or in your kindness you would have brought me out some comfort or other , and so an unnecessary risk would be run . I brought Cartwright down with me -- -you remember the little chap at the express office -- -and he has seen after my simple wants : a loaf of bread and a clean collar . What does man want more ? He has given me an extra pair of eyes upon a very active pair of feet , and both have been invaluable . `` `` Then my reports have all been wasted ! '' -- -My voice trembled as I recalled the pains and the pride with which I had composed them.Holmes took a bundle of papers from his pocket . `` Here are your reports , my dear fellow , and very well thumbed , I assure you . I made excellent arrangements , and they are only delayed one day upon their way . I must compliment you exceedingly upon the zeal and the intelligence which you have shown over an extraordinarily difficult case . `` I was still rather raw over the deception which had been practised upon me , but the warmth of Holmes 's praise drove my anger from my mind . I felt also in my heart that he was right in what he said and that it was really best for our purpose that I should not have known that he was upon the moor . `` That 's better , '' said he , seeing the shadow rise from my face . `` And now tell me the result of your visit to Mrs. Laura Lyons -- -it was not difficult for me to guess that it was to see her that you had gone , for I am already aware that she is the one person in Coombe Tracey who might be of service to us in the matter . In fact , if you had not gone today it is exceedingly probable that I should have gone tomorrow . `` The sun had set and dusk was settling over the moor . The air had turned chill and we withdrew into the hut for warmth . There , sitting together in the twilight , I told Holmes of my conversation with the lady . So interested was he that I had to repeat some of it twice before he was satisfied . `` This is most important , '' said he when I had concluded . `` It fills up a gap which I had been unable to bridge in this most complex affair . You are aware , perhaps , that a close intimacy exists between this lady and the man Stapleton ? `` `` I did not know of a close intimacy . `` `` There can be no doubt about the matter . They meet , they write , there is a complete understanding between them . Now , this puts a very powerful weapon into our hands . If I could only use it to detach his wife -- - '' '' His wife ? `` `` I am giving you some information now , in return for all that you have given me . The lady who has passed here as Miss Stapleton is in reality his wife . `` `` Good heavens , Holmes ! Are you sure of what you say ? How could he have permitted Sir Henry to fall in love with her ? `` `` Sir Henry 's falling in love could do no harm to anyone except Sir Henry . He took particular care that Sir Henry did not make love to her , as you have yourself observed . I repeat that the lady is his wife and not his sister . `` `` But why this elaborate deception ? `` `` Because he foresaw that she would be very much more useful to him in the character of a free woman . `` All my unspoken instincts , my vague suspicions , suddenly took shape and centred upon the naturalist . In that impassive colourless man , with his straw hat and his butterfly-net , I seemed to see something terrible -- -a creature of infinite patience and craft , with a
