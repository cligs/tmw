besmirched by a blackmailer , and only I can stop a disastrous scandal . You will see how impossible it is for me to go to Dartmoor . `` `` Whom would you recommend , then ? `` Holmes laid his hand upon my arm . `` If my friend would undertake it there is no man who is better worth having at your side when you are in a tight place . No one can say so more confidently than I . `` The proposition took me completely by surprise , but before I had time to answer , Baskerville seized me by the hand and wrung it heartily . `` Well , now , that is real kind of you , Dr. Watson , '' said he . `` You see how it is with me , and you know just as much about the matter as I do . If you will come down to Baskerville Hall and see me through I 'll never forget it . `` The promise of adventure had always a fascination for me , and I was complimented by the words of Holmes and by the eagerness with which the baronet hailed me as a companion . `` I will come , with pleasure , '' said I . `` I do not know how I could employ my time better . `` `` And you will report very carefully to me , '' said Holmes . `` When a crisis comes , as it will do , I will direct how you shall act . I suppose that by Saturday all might be ready ? `` `` Would that suit Dr . Watson ? '' '' Perfectly . `` `` Then on Saturday , unless you hear to the contrary , we shall meet at the ten-thirty train from Paddington . `` We had risen to depart when Baskerville gave a cry , of triumph , and diving into one of the corners of the room he drew a brown boot from under a cabinet . `` My missing boot ! '' he cried . `` May all our difficulties vanish as easily ! '' said Sherlock Holmes . `` But it is a very singular thing , '' Dr. Mortimer remarked . `` I searched this room carefully before lunch . `` `` And so did I , '' said Baskerville . `` Every inch of it . `` `` There was certainly no boot in it then . `` `` In that case the waiter must have placed it there while we were lunching . `` The German was sent for but professed to know nothing of the matter , nor could any inquiry clear it up . Another item had been added to that constant and apparently purposeless series of small mysteries which had succeeded each other so rapidly . Setting aside the whole grim story of Sir Charles 's death , we had a line of inexplicable incidents all within the limits of two days , which included the receipt of the printed letter , the black-bearded spy in the hansom , the loss of the new brown boot , the loss of the old black boot , and now the return of the new brown boot . Holmes sat in silence in the cab as we drove back to Baker Street , and I knew from his drawn brows and keen face that his mind , like my own , was busy in endeavouring to frame some scheme into which all these strange and apparently disconnected episodes could be fitted . All afternoon and late into the evening he sat lost in tobacco and thought.Just before dinner two telegrams were handed in . The first ran : Have just heard that Barrymore is at the Hall . BASKERVILLE.The second : Visited twenty-three hotels as directed , but sorry , to report unable to trace cut sheet of Times . CARTWRIGHT . `` There go two of my threads , Watson . There is nothing more stimulating than a case where everything goes against you . We must cast round for another scent . `` `` We have still the cabman who drove the spy. '' '' Exactly . I have wired to get his name and address from the Official Registry . I should not be surprised if this were an answer to my question . `` The ring at the bell proved to be something even more satisfactory than an answer , however , for the door opened and a rough-looking fellow entered who was evidently the man himself . `` I got a message from the head office that a gent at this address had been inquiring for No . 2704 , '' said he . `` I 've driven my cab this seven years and never a word of complaint . I came here straight from the Yard to ask you to your face what you had against me . `` `` I have nothing in the world against you , my good man , '' said Holmes . `` On the contrary , I have half a sovereign for you if you will give me a clear answer to my questions . `` `` Well , I 've had a good day and no mistake , '' said the cabman with a grin . `` What was it you wanted to ask , sir ? `` `` First of all your name and address , in case I want you again . `` `` John Clayton , 3 Turpey Street , the Borough . My cab is out of Shipley 's Yard , near Waterloo Station . `` Sherlock Holmes made a note of it . `` Now , Clayton , tell me all about the fare who came and watched this house at ten o'clock this morning and afterwards followed the two gentlemen down Regent Street . `` The man looked surprised and a little embarrassed . `` Why , there 's no good my telling you things , for you seem to know as much as I do already , '' said he . `` The truth is that the gentleman told me that he was a detective and that I was to say nothing about him to anyone . `` `` My good fellow ; this is a very serious business , and you may find yourself in a pretty bad position if you try to hide anything from me . You say that your fare told you that he was a detective ? `` `` Yes , he did . `` `` When did he say this ? `` `` When he left me . `` `` Did he say anything more ? `` `` He mentioned his name . `` Holmes cast a swift glance of triumph at me . `` Oh , he mentioned his name , did he ? That was imprudent . What was the name that he mentioned ? `` `` His name , '' said the cabman , `` was Mr. Sherlock Holmes . `` Never have I seen my friend more completely taken aback than by the cabman 's reply . For an instant he sat in silent amazement . Then he burst into a hearty laugh . `` A touch , Watson -- -an undeniable touch ! '' said he . `` I feel a foil as quick and supple as my own . He got home upon me very prettily that time . So his name was Sherlock Holmes , was it ? `` `` Yes , sir , that was the gentleman 's name. '' '' Excellent ! Tell me where you picked him up and all that occurred . `` `` He hailed me at half-past nine in Trafalgar Square . He said that he was a detective , and he offered me two guineas if I would do exactly what he wanted all day and ask no questions . I was glad enough to agree . First we drove down to the Northumberland Hotel and waited there until two gentlemen came out and took a cab from the rank . We followed their cab until it pulled up somewhere near here . `` `` This very door , '' said Holmes . `` Well , I could n't be sure of that , but I dare say my fare knew all about it . We pulled up halfway down the street and waited an hour and a half . Then the two gentlemen passed us , walking , and we followed down Baker Street and along -- - '' '' I know , '' said Holmes . `` Until we got three-quarters down Regent Street . Then my gentleman threw up the trap , and he cried that I should drive right away to Waterloo Station as hard as I could go . I whipped up the mare and we were there under the ten minutes . Then he paid up his two guineas , like a good one , and away he went into the station . Only just as he was leaving he turned round and he said : 'It might interest you to know that you have been driving Mr. Sherlock Holmes . ' That 's how I come to know the name . `` `` I see . And you saw no more of him ? `` `` Not after he went into the station . `` `` And how would you describe Mr. Sherlock Holmes ? `` The cabman scratched his head . `` Well , he was n't altogether such an easy gentleman to describe . I 'd put him at forty years of age , and he was of a middle height , two or three inches shorter than you , sir . He was dressed like a toff , and he had a black beard , cut square at the end , and a pale face . I do n't know as I could say more than that . `` `` Colour of his eyes ? `` `` No , I ca n't say that . `` `` Nothing more that you can remember ? `` `` No , sir ; nothing . `` `` Well , then , here is your half-sovereign . There 's another one waiting for you if you can bring any more information . Good-night ! `` `` Good-night , sir , and thank you ! `` John Clayton departed chuckling , and Holmes turned to me with a shrug of his shoulders and a rueful smile . `` Snap goes our third thread , and we end where we began , '' said he . `` The cunning rascal ! He knew our number , knew that Sir Henry Baskerville had consulted me , spotted who I was in Regent Street , conjectured that I had got the number of the cab and would lay my hands on the driver , and so sent back this audacious message . I tell you , Watson , this time we have got a foeman who is worthy of our steel . I 've been checkmated in London . I can only wish you better luck in Devonshire . But I 'm not easy in my mind about it . `` `` About what ? `` `` About sending you . It 's an ugly business , Watson , an ugly dangerous business , and the more I see of it the less I like it . Yes , my dear fellow , you may laugh , but I give you my word that I shall be very glad to have you back safe and sound in Baker Street once more . `` Sir Henry Baskerville and Dr. Mortimer were ready upon the appointed day , and we started as arranged for Devonshire .
