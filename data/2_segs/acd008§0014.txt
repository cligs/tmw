in the air . `` Mr. Raffles Haw has been here , and he has asked me to be his wife . `` `` The deuce he did ! '' cried the old man . `` And you said -- - ? `` `` I am to see him again . `` `` And you will say -- - ? `` `` I will accept him . `` `` You were always a good girl , Laura , '' said old McIntyre , standing on his tiptoes to kiss her . `` But Laura , Laura , how about Hector ? '' asked Robert in mild remonstrance . `` Oh , I have written to him , '' his sister answered carelessly . `` I wish you would be good enough to post the letter . `` And so Laura McIntyre became duly engaged to Raffles Haw , and old McIntyre grew even more hungry-looking as he felt himself a step nearer to the source of wealth , while Robert thought less of work than ever , and never gave as much as a thought to the great canvas which still stood , dust-covered , upon his easel . Haw gave Laura an engagement ring of old gold , with a great blazing diamond bulging out of it . There was little talk about the matter , however , for it was Haw 's wish that all should be done very quietly . Nearly all his evenings were spent at Elmdene , where he and Laura would build up the most colossal schemes of philanthropy for the future . With a map stretched out on the table in front of them , these two young people would , as it were , hover over the world , planning , devising , and improving . `` Bless the girl ! '' said old McIntyre to his son ; `` she speaks about it as if she were born to millions . Maybe , when once she is married , she wo n't be so ready to chuck her money into every mad scheme that her husband can think of . `` `` Laura is greatly changed , '' Robert answered ; `` she has grown much more serious in her ideas . `` `` You wait a bit ! '' sniggered his father . `` She is a good girl , is Laura , and she knows what she is about . She 's not a girl to let her old dad go to the wall if she can set him right . It 's a pretty state of things , '' he added bitterly : `` here 's my daughter going to marry a man who thinks no more of gold than I used to of gun-metal ; and here 's my son going about with all the money he cares to ask for to help every ne'er-do-well in Staffordshire ; and here 's their father , who loved them and cared for them , and brought them both up , without money enough very often to buy a bottle of brandy . I do n't know what your poor dear mother would have thought of it . `` `` You have only to ask for what you want . `` `` Yes , as if I were a five-year-old child . But I tell you , Robert , I 'll have my rights , and if I ca n't get them one way I will another . I wo n't be treated as if I were no one . And there 's one thing : if I am to be this man 's pa-in-law , I 'll want to know something about him and his money first . We may be poor , but we are honest . I 'll up to the Hall now , and have it out with him . '' He seized his hat and stick and made for the door . `` No , no , father , '' cried Robert , catching him by the sleeve . `` You had better leave the matter alone . Mr. Haw is a very sensitive man . He would not like to be examined upon such a point . It might lead to a serious quarrel . I beg that you will not go . `` `` I am not to be put off for ever , '' snarled the old man , who had been drinking heavily . `` I 'll put my foot down now , once and for ever . '' He tugged at his sleeve to free himself from his son 's grasp . `` At least you shall not go without Laura knowing . I will call her down , and we shall have her opinion . `` `` Oh , I do n't want to have any scenes , '' said McIntyre sulkily , relaxing his efforts . He lived in dread of his daughter , and at his worst moments the mention of her name would serve to restrain him . `` Besides , '' said Robert , `` I have not the slightest doubt that Raffles Haw will see the necessity for giving us some sort of explanation before matters go further . He must understand that we have some claim now to be taken into his confidence . `` He had hardly spoken when there was a tap at the door , and the man of whom they were speaking walked in . `` Good-morning , Mr. McIntyre , '' said he . `` Robert , would you mind stepping up to the Hall with me ? I want to have a little business chat . '' He looked serious , like a man who is carrying out something which he has well weighed.They walked up together with hardly a word on either side . Raffles Haw was absorbed in his own thoughts . Robert felt expectant and nervous , for he knew that something of importance lay before him . The winter had almost passed now , and the first young shoots were beginning to peep out timidly in the face of the wind and the rain of an English March . The snows were gone , but the countryside looked bleaker and drearier , all shrouded in the haze from the damp , sodden meadows . `` By the way , Robert , '' said Raffles Haw suddenly , as they walked up the Avenue . `` Has your great Roman picture gone to London ? `` `` I have not finished it yet . `` `` But I know that you are a quick worker . You must be nearly at the end of it . `` `` No , I am afraid that it has not advanced much since you saw it . For one thing , the light has not been very good . `` Raffles Haw said nothing , but a pained expression flashed over his face . When they reached the house he led the way through the museum . Two great metal cases were lying on the floor . `` I have a small addition there to the gem collection , '' he remarked as he passed . `` They only arrived last night , and I have not opened them yet , but I am given to understand from the letters and invoices that there are some fine specimens . We might arrange them this afternoon , if you care to assist me . Let us go into the smoking-room now . `` He threw himself down into a settee , and motioned Robert into the armchair in front of him . `` Light a cigar , '' he said . `` Press the spring if there is any refreshment which you would like . Now , my dear Robert , confess to me in the first place that you have often thought me mad . `` The charge was so direct and so true that the young artist hesitated , hardly knowing how to answer . `` My dear boy , I do not blame you . It was the most natural thing in the world . I should have looked upon anyone as a madman who had talked to me as I have talked to you . But for all that , Robert , you were wrong , and I have never yet in our conversations proposed any scheme which it was not well within my power to carry out . I tell you in all sober earnest that the amount of my income is limited only by my desire , and that all the bankers and financiers combined could not furnish the sums which I can put forward without an effort . `` `` I have had ample proof of your immense wealth , '' said Robert . `` And you are very naturally curious as to how that wealth was obtained . Well , I can tell you one thing . The money is perfectly clean . I have robbed no one , cheated no one , sweated no one , ground no one down in the gaining of it . I can read your father 's eye , Robert . I can see that he has done me an injustice in this matter . Well , perhaps he is not to be blamed . Perhaps I also might think uncharitable things if I were In his place . But that is why I now give an explanation to you , Robert , and not to him . You , at least , have trusted me , and you have a right , before I become one of your family , to know all that I can tell you . Laura also has trusted me , but I know well that she is content still to trust me . `` `` I would not intrude upon your secrets , Mr. Haw , '' said Robert , `` but of course I can not deny that I should be very proud and pleased if you cared to confide them to me . `` `` And I will . Not all . I do not think that I shall ever , while I live , tell all . But I shall leave directions behind me so that when I die you may be able to carry on my unfinished work . I shall tell you where those directions are to be found . In the meantime , you must be content to learn the effects which I produce without knowing every detail as to the means . `` Robert settled himself down in his chair and concentrated his attention upon his companion 's words , while Haw bent forward his eager , earnest face , like a man who knows the value of the words which he is saying . `` You are already aware , '' he remarked , `` that I have devoted a great deal of energy and of time to the study of chemistry . `` `` So you told me . `` `` I commenced my studies under a famous English chemist , I continued them under the best man in France , and I completed them in the most celebrated laboratory of Germany . I was not rich , but my father had left me enough to keep me comfortably , and by living economically I had a sum at my command which enabled me to carry out my studies in a very complete way . When I returned to England I built myself a laboratory in a quiet country place where I could work without distraction or interruption . There I began a series of investigations which soon took me into regions of science to which none of the three famous men who taught me had ever penetrated .
