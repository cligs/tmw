at Hobson 's Patch , and so did I. I chanced into the telegraph bureau , and he was leaving it . `` 'See here , ' said the operator after he 'd gone out , 'I guess we should charge double rates for this . ' -- -'I guess you should , ' said I . He had filled the form with stuff that might have been Chinese , for all we could make of it . 'He fires a sheet of this off every day , ' said the clerk . 'Yes , ' said I ; 'it 's special news for his paper , and he 's scared that the others should tap it . ' That was what the operator thought and what I thought at the time ; but I think differently now . `` `` By Gar ! I believe you are right , '' said McGinty . `` But what do you allow that we should do about it ? `` `` Why not go right down now and fix him ? '' someone suggested . `` Ay , the sooner the better . `` `` I 'd start this next minute if I knew where we could find him , '' said McMurdo . `` He 's in Hobson 's Patch ; but I do n't know the house . I 've got a plan , though , if you 'll only take my advice . `` `` Well , what is it ? `` `` I 'll go to the Patch to-morrow morning . I 'll find him through the operator . He can locate him , I guess . Well , then I 'll tell him that I 'm a Freeman myself . I 'll offer him all the secrets of the lodge for a price . You bet he 'll tumble to it . I 'll tell him the papers are at my house , and that it 's as much as my life would be worth to let him come while folk were about . He 'll see that that 's horse sense . Let him come at ten o'clock at night , and he shall see everything . That will fetch him sure. '' '' Well ? `` `` You can plan the rest for yourselves . Widow MacNamara 's is a lonely house . She 's as true as steel and as deaf as a post . There 's only Scanlan and me in the house . If I get his promise -- -and I 'll let you know if I do -- -I 'd have the whole seven of you come to me by nine o'clock . We 'll get him in . If ever he gets out alive -- -well , he can talk of Birdy Edwards 's luck for the rest of his days ! `` `` There 's going to be a vacancy at Pinkerton 's or I 'm mistaken . Leave it at that , McMurdo . At nine to-morrow we 'll be with you . You once get the door shut behind him , and you can leave the rest with us . `` As McMurdo had said , the house in which he lived was a lonely one and very well suited for such a crime as they had planned . It was on the extreme fringe of the town and stood well back from the road . In any other case the conspirators would have simply called out their man , as they had many a time before , and emptied their pistols into his body ; but in this instance it was very necessary to find out how much he knew , how he knew it , and what had been passed on to his employers.It was possible that they were already too late and that the work had been done . If that was indeed so , they could at least have their revenge upon the man who had done it . But they were hopeful that nothing of great importance had yet come to the detective 's knowledge , as otherwise , they argued , he would not have troubled to write down and forward such trivial information as McMurdo claimed to have given him . However , all this they would learn from his own lips . Once in their power , they would find a way to make him speak . It was not the first time that they had handled an unwilling witness.McMurdo went to Hobson 's Patch as agreed . The police seemed to take particular interest in him that morning , and Captain Marvin -- -he who had claimed the old acquaintance with him at Chicago -- -actually addressed him as he waited at the station . McMurdo turned away and refused to speak with him . He was back from his mission in the afternoon , and saw McGinty at the Union House . `` He is coming , '' he said. '' Good ! '' said McGinty . The giant was in his shirt sleeves , with chains and seals gleaming athwart his ample waistcoat and a diamond twinkling through the fringe of his bristling beard . Drink and politics had made the Boss a very rich as well as powerful man . The more terrible , therefore , seemed that glimpse of the prison or the gallows which had risen before him the night before . `` Do you reckon he knows much ? '' he asked anxiously.McMurdo shook his head gloomily . `` He 's been here some time -- -six weeks at the least . I guess he did n't come into these parts to look at the prospect . If he has been working among us all that time with the railroad money at his back , I should expect that he has got results , and that he has passed them on . `` `` There 's not a weak man in the lodge , '' cried McGinty . `` True as steel , every man of them . And yet , by the Lord ! there is that skunk Morris . What about him ? If any man gives us away , it would be he . I 've a mind to send a couple of the boys round before evening to give him a beating up and see what they can get from him . `` `` Well , there would be no harm in that , '' McMurdo answered . `` I wo n't deny that I have a liking for Morris and would be sorry to see him come to harm . He has spoken to me once or twice over lodge matters , and though he may not see them the same as you or I , he never seemed the sort that squeals . But still it is not for me to stand between him and you . `` `` I 'll fix the old devil ! '' said McGinty with an oath . `` I 've had my eye on him this year past . `` `` Well , you know best about that , '' McMurdo answered . `` But whatever you do must be to-morrow ; for we must lie low until the Pinkerton affair is settled up . We ca n't afford to set the police buzzing , to-day of all days . `` `` True for you , '' said McGinty . `` And we 'll learn from Birdy Edwards himself where he got his news if we have to cut his heart out first . Did he seem to scent a trap ? `` McMurdo laughed . `` I guess I took him on his weak point , '' he said . `` If he could get on a good trail of the Scowrers , he 's ready to follow it into hell . I took his money , '' McMurdo grinned as he produced a wad of dollar notes , `` and as much more when he has seen all my papers . `` `` What papers ? `` `` Well , there are no papers . But I filled him up about constitutions and books of rules and forms of membership . He expects to get right down to the end of everything before he leaves . `` `` Faith , he 's right there , '' said McGinty grimly . `` Did n't he ask you why you did n't bring him the papers ? `` `` As if I would carry such things , and me a suspected man , and Captain Marvin after speaking to me this very day at the depot ! `` `` Ay , I heard of that , '' said McGinty . `` I guess the heavy end of this business is coming on to you . We could put him down an old shaft when we 've done with him ; but however we work it we ca n't get past the man living at Hobson 's Patch and you being there to-day . `` McMurdo shrugged his shoulders . `` If we handle it right , they can never prove the killing , '' said he . `` No one can see him come to the house after dark , and I 'll lay to it that no one will see him go . Now see here , Councillor , I 'll show you my plan and I 'll ask you to fit the others into it . You will all come in good time . Very well . He comes at ten . He is to tap three times , and me to open the door for him . Then I 'll get behind him and shut it . He 's our man then . `` `` That 's all easy and plain . `` `` Yes ; but the next step wants considering . He 's a hard proposition . He 's heavily armed . I 've fooled him proper , and yet he is likely to be on his guard . Suppose I show him right into a room with seven men in it where he expected to find me alone . There is going to be shooting , and somebody is going to be hurt . `` `` That 's so . `` `` And the noise is going to bring every damned copper in the township on top of it . `` `` I guess you are right . `` `` This is how I should work it . You will all be in the big room -- -same as you saw when you had a chat with me . I 'll open the door for him , show him into the parlour beside the door , and leave him there while I get the papers . That will give me the chance of telling you how things are shaping . Then I will go back to him with some faked papers . As he is reading them I will jump for him and get my grip on his pistol arm . You 'll hear me call and in you will rush . The quicker the better ; for he is as strong a man as I , and I may have more than I can manage . But I allow that I can hold him till you come . `` `` It 's a good plan , '' said McGinty . `` The lodge will owe you a debt for this . I guess when I move out of the chair I can put a name to the man that 's coming after me . `` `` Sure , Councillor , I am little more than a recruit , '' said McMurdo ; but his face showed what he thought of the great man
