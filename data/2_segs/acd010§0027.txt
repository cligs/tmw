gleamed golden in the mellow sunshine . A number of long dark objects , which were too large for alligators and too long for canoes , lay upon the edges of these patches of sand . With my glass I could clearly see that they were alive , but what their nature might be I could not imagine.From the side of the plateau on which we were , slopes of woodland , with occasional glades , stretched down for five or six miles to the central lake . I could see at my very feet the glade of the iguanodons , and farther off was a round opening in the trees which marked the swamp of the pterodactyls . On the side facing me , however , the plateau presented a very different aspect . There the basalt cliffs of the outside were reproduced upon the inside , forming an escarpment about two hundred feet high , with a woody slope beneath it . Along the base of these red cliffs , some distance above the ground , I could see a number of dark holes through the glass , which I conjectured to be the mouths of caves . At the opening of one of these something white was shimmering , but I was unable to make out what it was . I sat charting the country until the sun had set and it was so dark that I could no longer distinguish details . Then I climbed down to my companions waiting for me so eagerly at the bottom of the great tree . For once I was the hero of the expedition . Alone I had thought of it , and alone I had done it ; and here was the chart which would save us a month 's blind groping among unknown dangers . Each of them shook me solemnly by the hand.But before they discussed the details of my map I had to tell them of my encounter with the ape-man among the branches . `` He has been there all the time , '' said I . `` How do you know that ? '' asked Lord John . `` Because I have never been without that feeling that something malevolent was watching us . I mentioned it to you , Professor Challenger . `` `` Our young friend certainly said something of the kind . He is also the one among us who is endowed with that Celtic temperament which would make him sensitive to such impressions . `` `` The whole theory of telepathy -- -- -- '' began Summerlee , filling his pipe . `` Is too vast to be now discussed , '' said Challenger , with decision . `` Tell me , now , '' he added , with the air of a bishop addressing a Sunday-school , `` did you happen to observe whether the creature could cross its thumb over its palm ? `` `` No , indeed . `` `` Had it a tail ? '' '' No . `` `` Was the foot prehensile ? `` `` I do not think it could have made off so fast among the branches if it could not get a grip with its feet . `` `` In South America there are , if my memory serves me -- -you will check the observation , Professor Summerlee -- -some thirty-six species of monkeys , but the anthropoid ape is unknown . It is clear , however , that he exists in this country , and that he is not the hairy , gorilla-like variety , which is never seen out of Africa or the East . '' ( I was inclined to interpolate , as I looked at him , that I had seen his first cousin in Kensington . ) `` This is a whiskered and colorless type , the latter characteristic pointing to the fact that he spends his days in arboreal seclusion . The question which we have to face is whether he approaches more closely to the ape or the man . In the latter case , he may well approximate to what the vulgar have called the 'missing link . ' The solution of this problem is our immediate duty . `` `` It is nothing of the sort , '' said Summerlee , abruptly . `` Now that , through the intelligence and activity of Mr. Malone '' ( I can not help quoting the words ) , `` we have got our chart , our one and only immediate duty is to get ourselves safe and sound out of this awful place . `` `` The flesh-pots of civilization , '' groaned Challenger . `` The ink-pots of civilization , sir . It is our task to put on record what we have seen , and to leave the further exploration to others . You all agreed as much before Mr. Malone got us the chart . `` `` Well , '' said Challenger , `` I admit that my mind will be more at ease when I am assured that the result of our expedition has been conveyed to our friends . How we are to get down from this place I have not as yet an idea . I have never yet encountered any problem , however , which my inventive brain was unable to solve , and I promise you that to-morrow I will turn my attention to the question of our descent . '' And so the matter was allowed to rest.But that evening , by the light of the fire and of a single candle , the first map of the lost world was elaborated . Every detail which I had roughly noted from my watch-tower was drawn out in its relative place . Challenger 's pencil hovered over the great blank which marked the lake . `` What shall we call it ? '' he asked . `` Why should you not take the chance of perpetuating your own name ? '' said Summerlee , with his usual touch of acidity . `` I trust , sir , that my name will have other and more personal claims upon posterity , '' said Challenger , severely . `` Any ignoramus can hand down his worthless memory by imposing it upon a mountain or a river . I need no such monument . `` Summerlee , with a twisted smile , was about to make some fresh assault when Lord John hastened to intervene . `` It 's up to you , young fellah , to name the lake , '' said he . `` You saw it first , and , by George , if you choose to put 'Lake Malone ' on it , no one has a better right . `` `` By all means . Let our young friend give it a name , '' said Challenger . `` Then , '' said I , blushing , I dare say , as I said it , `` let it be named Lake Gladys . `` `` Do n't you think the Central Lake would be more descriptive ? '' remarked Summerlee . `` I should prefer Lake Gladys . `` Challenger looked at me sympathetically , and shook his great head in mock disapproval . `` Boys will be boys , '' said he . `` Lake Gladys let it be . `` I have said -- -or perhaps I have not said , for my memory plays me sad tricks these days -- -that I glowed with pride when three such men as my comrades thanked me for having saved , or at least greatly helped , the situation . As the youngster of the party , not merely in years , but in experience , character , knowledge , and all that goes to make a man , I had been overshadowed from the first . And now I was coming into my own . I warmed at the thought . Alas ! for the pride which goes before a fall ! That little glow of self-satisfaction , that added measure of self-confidence , were to lead me on that very night to the most dreadful experience of my life , ending with a shock which turns my heart sick when I think of it.It came about in this way . I had been unduly excited by the adventure of the tree , and sleep seemed to be impossible . Summerlee was on guard , sitting hunched over our small fire , a quaint , angular figure , his rifle across his knees and his pointed , goat-like beard wagging with each weary nod of his head . Lord John lay silent , wrapped in the South American poncho which he wore , while Challenger snored with a roll and rattle which reverberated through the woods . The full moon was shining brightly , and the air was crisply cold . What a night for a walk ! And then suddenly came the thought , `` Why not ? '' Suppose I stole softly away , suppose I made my way down to the central lake , suppose I was back at breakfast with some record of the place -- -would I not in that case be thought an even more worthy associate ? Then , if Summerlee carried the day and some means of escape were found , we should return to London with first-hand knowledge of the central mystery of the plateau , to which I alone , of all men , would have penetrated . I thought of Gladys , with her `` There are heroisms all round us . '' I seemed to hear her voice as she said it . I thought also of McArdle . What a three column article for the paper ! What a foundation for a career ! A correspondentship in the next great war might be within my reach . I clutched at a gun -- -my pockets were full of cartridges -- -and , parting the thorn bushes at the gate of our zareba , quickly slipped out . My last glance showed me the unconscious Summerlee , most futile of sentinels , still nodding away like a queer mechanical toy in front of the smouldering fire.I had not gone a hundred yards before I deeply repented my rashness . I may have said somewhere in this chronicle that I am too imaginative to be a really courageous man , but that I have an overpowering fear of seeming afraid . This was the power which now carried me onwards . I simply could not slink back with nothing done . Even if my comrades should not have missed me , and should never know of my weakness , there would still remain some intolerable self-shame in my own soul . And yet I shuddered at the position in which I found myself , and would have given all I possessed at that moment to have been honorably free of the whole business.It was dreadful in the forest . The trees grew so thickly and their foliage spread so widely that I could see nothing of the moon-light save that here and there the high branches made a tangled filigree against the starry sky . As the eyes became more used to the obscurity one learned that there were different degrees of darkness among the trees -- -that some were dimly visible , while between and among them there were coal-black shadowed patches , like the mouths of caves , from which I shrank in horror as I passed . I thought of the despairing yell of the tortured iguanodon -- -that dreadful cry which had echoed through the woods . I thought , too , of the glimpse I had in the light of Lord John 's torch
