that I could only stoop and kiss it . `` I dare say I am merely a foolish woman with a young girl 's fancies . And yet it is so real with me , so entirely part of my very self , that I can not help acting upon it . If I marry , I do want to marry a famous man ! `` `` Why should you not ? '' I cried . `` It is women like you who brace men up . Give me a chance , and see if I will take it ! Besides , as you say , men ought to MAKE their own chances , and not wait until they are given . Look at Clive -- -just a clerk , and he conquered India ! By George ! I 'll do something in the world yet ! `` She laughed at my sudden Irish effervescence . `` Why not ? '' she said . `` You have everything a man could have , -- -youth , health , strength , education , energy . I was sorry you spoke . And now I am glad -- -so glad -- -if it wakens these thoughts in you ! `` `` And if I do -- -- -- '' Her dear hand rested like warm velvet upon my lips . `` Not another word , Sir ! You should have been at the office for evening duty half an hour ago ; only I had n't the heart to remind you . Some day , perhaps , when you have won your place in the world , we shall talk it over again . `` And so it was that I found myself that foggy November evening pursuing the Camberwell tram with my heart glowing within me , and with the eager determination that not another day should elapse before I should find some deed which was worthy of my lady . But who -- -who in all this wide world could ever have imagined the incredible shape which that deed was to take , or the strange steps by which I was led to the doing of it ? And , after all , this opening chapter will seem to the reader to have nothing to do with my narrative ; and yet there would have been no narrative without it , for it is only when a man goes out into the world with the thought that there are heroisms all round him , and with the desire all alive in his heart to follow any which may come within sight of him , that he breaks away as I did from the life he knows , and ventures forth into the wonderful mystic twilight land where lie the great adventures and the great rewards . Behold me , then , at the office of the Daily Gazette , on the staff of which I was a most insignificant unit , with the settled determination that very night , if possible , to find the quest which should be worthy of my Gladys ! Was it hardness , was it selfishness , that she should ask me to risk my life for her own glorification ? Such thoughts may come to middle age ; but never to ardent three-and-twenty in the fever of his first love.I always liked McArdle , the crabbed , old , round-backed , red-headed news editor , and I rather hoped that he liked me . Of course , Beaumont was the real boss ; but he lived in the rarefied atmosphere of some Olympian height from which he could distinguish nothing smaller than an international crisis or a split in the Cabinet . Sometimes we saw him passing in lonely majesty to his inner sanctum , with his eyes staring vaguely and his mind hovering over the Balkans or the Persian Gulf . He was above and beyond us . But McArdle was his first lieutenant , and it was he that we knew . The old man nodded as I entered the room , and he pushed his spectacles far up on his bald forehead . `` Well , Mr. Malone , from all I hear , you seem to be doing very well , '' said he in his kindly Scotch accent.I thanked him . `` The colliery explosion was excellent . So was the Southwark fire . You have the true descreeptive touch . What did you want to see me about ? `` `` To ask a favor . `` He looked alarmed , and his eyes shunned mine . `` Tut , tut ! What is it ? `` `` Do you think , Sir , that you could possibly send me on some mission for the paper ? I would do my best to put it through and get you some good copy . `` `` What sort of meesion had you in your mind , Mr . Malone ? `` `` Well , Sir , anything that had adventure and danger in it . I really would do my very best . The more difficult it was , the better it would suit me . `` `` You seem very anxious to lose your life . `` `` To justify my life , Sir . `` `` Dear me , Mr. Malone , this is very -- -very exalted . I 'm afraid the day for this sort of thing is rather past . The expense of the 'special meesion ' business hardly justifies the result , and , of course , in any case it would only be an experienced man with a name that would command public confidence who would get such an order . The big blank spaces in the map are all being filled in , and there 's no room for romance anywhere . Wait a bit , though ! '' he added , with a sudden smile upon his face . `` Talking of the blank spaces of the map gives me an idea . What about exposing a fraud -- -a modern Munchausen -- -and making him rideeculous ? You could show him up as the liar that he is ! Eh , man , it would be fine . How does it appeal to you ? `` `` Anything -- -anywhere -- -I care nothing . `` McArdle was plunged in thought for some minutes . `` I wonder whether you could get on friendly -- -or at least on talking terms with the fellow , '' he said , at last . `` You seem to have a sort of genius for establishing relations with people -- -seempathy , I suppose , or animal magnetism , or youthful vitality , or something . I am conscious of it myself . `` `` You are very good , sir . `` `` So why should you not try your luck with Professor Challenger , of Enmore Park ? `` I dare say I looked a little startled. '' Challenger ! '' I cried . `` Professor Challenger , the famous zoologist ! Was n't he the man who broke the skull of Blundell , of the Telegraph ? `` The news editor smiled grimly . `` Do you mind ? Did n't you say it was adventures you were after ? `` `` It is all in the way of business , sir , '' I answered. '' Exactly . I do n't suppose he can always be so violent as that . I 'm thinking that Blundell got him at the wrong moment , maybe , or in the wrong fashion . You may have better luck , or more tact in handling him . There 's something in your line there , I am sure , and the Gazette should work it . `` `` I really know nothing about him , '' said I . `` I only remember his name in connection with the police-court proceedings , for striking Blundell . `` `` I have a few notes for your guidance , Mr. Malone . I 've had my eye on the Professor for some little time . '' He took a paper from a drawer . `` Here is a summary of his record . I give it you briefly : -- - '' 'Challenger , George Edward .

Recreations : Walking , Alpine climbing . Address : Enmore Park , Kensington , W. ' '' There , take it with you . I 've nothing more for you to-night . `` I pocketed the slip of paper . `` One moment , sir , '' I said , as I realized that it was a pink bald head , and not a red face , which was fronting me . `` I am not very clear yet why I am to interview this gentleman . What has he done ? `` The face flashed back again . `` Went to South America on a solitary expedeetion two years ago . Came back last year . Had undoubtedly been to South America , but refused to say exactly where . Began to tell his adventures in a vague way , but somebody started to pick holes , and he just shut up like an oyster . Something wonderful happened -- -or the man 's a champion liar , which is the more probable supposeetion . Had some damaged photographs , said to be fakes . Got so touchy that he assaults anyone who asks questions , and heaves reporters down the stairs . In my opinion he 's just a homicidal megalomaniac with a turn for science . That 's your man , Mr. Malone . Now , off you run , and see what you can make of him . You 're big enough to look after yourself . Anyway , you are all safe . Employers ' Liability Act , you know . `` A grinning red face turned once more into a pink oval , fringed with gingery fluff ; the interview was at an end.I walked across to the Savage Club , but instead of turning into it I leaned upon the railings of Adelphi Terrace and gazed thoughtfully for a long time at the brown , oily river . I can always think most sanely and clearly in the open air . I took out the list of Professor Challenger 's exploits , and I read it over under the electric lamp . Then I had what I can only regard as an inspiration . As a Pressman , I felt sure from what I had been told that I could never hope to get into touch with this cantankerous Professor . But these recriminations , twice mentioned in his skeleton biography , could only mean that he was a fanatic in science . Was there not an exposed margin there upon which he might be accessible ? I would try.I entered the club . It
