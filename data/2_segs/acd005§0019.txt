wish to see her . `` `` Pardon , sire , but she -- - '' '' Is everyone to thwart me to-day ? '' snarled the king , and taking the little page by his velvet collar , he hurled him to the other side of the room . Then , without knocking , he opened the door , and passed on into the lady 's boudoir.It was a large and lofty room , very different to that from which he had just come . Three long windows from ceiling to floor took up one side , and through the delicate pink-tinted blinds the evening sun cast a subdued and dainty light . Great gold candelabra glittered between the mirrors upon the wall , and Le Brun had expended all his wealth of colouring upon the ceiling , where Louis himself , in the character of Jove , hurled down his thunder-bolts upon a writhing heap of Dutch and Palatine Titans . Pink was the prevailing tone in tapestry , carpet , and furniture , so that the whole room seemed to shine with the sweet tints of the inner side of a shell , and when lit up , as it was then , formed such a chamber as some fairy hero might have built up for his princess . At the further side , prone upon an ottoman , her face buried in the cushion , her beautiful white arms thrown over it , the rich coils of her brown hair hanging in disorder across the long curve of her ivory neck , lay , like a drooping flower , the woman whom he had come to discard.At the sound of the closing door she had glanced up , and then , at the sight of the king , she sprang to her feet and ran towards him , her hands out , her blue eyes bedimmed with tears , her whole beautiful figure softening into womanliness and humility . `` Ah , sire , '' she cried , with a pretty little sunburst of joy through her tears , `` then I have wronged you ! I have wronged you cruelly ! You have kept your promise . You were but trying my faith ! Oh , how could I have said such words to you -- -how could I pain that noble heart ! But you have come after me to tell me that you have forgiven me ! '' She put her arms forward with the trusting air of a pretty child who claims an embrace as her due , but the king stepped swiftly back from her , and warned her away from him with an angry gesture . `` All is over forever between us , '' he cried harshly . `` Your brother will await you at the east gate at six o'clock , and it is my command that you wait there until you receive my further orders . `` She staggered back as if he had struck her . `` Leave you ! '' she cried . `` You must leave the court . `` `` The court ! Ay , willingly , this instant ! But you ! Ah , sire , you ask what is impossible . `` `` I do not ask , madame ; I order . Since you have learned to abuse your position , your presence has become intolerable . The united kings of Europe have never dared to speak to me as you have spoken to-day . You have insulted me in my own palace -- -me , Louis , the king . Such things are not done twice , madame . Your insolence has carried you too far this time . You thought that because I was forbearing , I was therefore weak . It appeared to you that if you only humoured me one moment , you might treat me as if I were your equal the next , for that this poor puppet of a king could always be bent this way or that . You see your mistake now . At six o'clock you leave Versailles forever . '' His eyes flashed , and his small upright figure seemed to swell in the violence of his indignation , while she leaned away from him , one hand across her eyes and one thrown forward , as if to screen her from that angry gaze . `` Oh , I have been wicked ! '' she cried . `` I know it , I know it ! `` `` I am glad , madame , that you have the grace to acknowledge it . `` `` How could I speak to you so ! How could I ! Oh , that some blight may come upon this unhappy tongue ! I , who have had nothing but good from you ! I to insult you , who are the author of all my happiness ! Oh , sire , forgive me , forgive me ! for pity 's sake forgive me ! `` Louis was by nature a kind-hearted man . His feelings were touched , and his pride also was flattered by the abasement of this beautiful and haughty woman . His other favourites had been amiable to all , but this one was so proud , so unyielding , until she felt his master-hand . His face softened somewhat in its expression as he glanced at her , but he shook his head , and his voice was as firm as ever as he answered . `` It is useless , madame , '' said he . `` I have thought this matter over for a long time , and your madness to-day has only hurried what must in any case have taken place . You must leave the palace . `` `` I will leave the palace . Say only that you forgive me . Oh , sire , I can not bear your anger . It crushes me down . I am not strong enough . It is not banishment , it is death to which you sentence me . Think of our long years of love , sire , and say that you forgive me . I have given up all for your sake -- -husband , honour , everything . Oh , will you not give your anger up for mine ? My God , he weeps ! Oh , I am saved , I am saved ! `` `` No , no , madame , '' cried the king , dashing his hand across his eyes . `` You see the weakness of the man , but you shall also see the firmness of the king . As to your insults to-day , I forgive them freely , if that will make you more happy in your retirement . But I owe a duty to my subjects also , and that duty is to set them an example . We have thought too little of such things . But a time has come when it is necessary to review our past life , and to prepare for that which is to come . `` `` Ah , sire , you pain me . You are not yet in the prime of your years , and you speak as though old age were upon you . In a score of years from now it may be time for folk to say that age has made a change in your life . `` The king winced . `` Who says so ? '' he cried angrily . `` Oh , sire , it slipped from me unawares . Think no more of it . Nobody says so . Nobody . `` `` You are hiding something from me . Who is it who says this ? `` `` Oh , do not ask me , sire . `` `` You said that it was reported that I had changed my life not through religion , but through stress of years . Who said so ? `` `` Oh , sire , it was but foolish court gossip , all unworthy of your attention . It was but the empty common talk of cavaliers who had nothing else to say to gain a smile from their ladies . `` `` The common talk ? '' Louis flushed crimson . `` Have I , then , grown so aged ? You have known me for nearly twenty years . Do you see such changes in me ? `` `` To me , sire , you are as pleasing and as gracious as when you first won the heart of Mademoiselle Tonnay-Charente . `` The king smiled as he looked at the beautiful woman before him . `` In very truth , '' said he , `` I can say that there has been no such great change in Mademoiselle Tonnay-Charente either . But still it is best that we should part , Francoise . `` `` If it will add aught to your happiness , sire , I shall go through it , be it to my death . `` `` Now that is the proper spirit . `` `` You have but to name the place , sire -- -Petit Bourg , Chargny , or my own convent of St. Joseph in the Faubourg St. Germain . What matter where the flower withers , when once the sun has forever turned from it ? At least , the past is my own , and I shall live in the remembrance of the days when none had come between us , and when your sweet love was all my own . Be happy , sire , be happy , and think no more of what I said about the foolish gossip of the court . Your life lies in the future . Mine is in the past . Adieu , dear sire , adieu ! '' She threw forward her hands , her eyes dimmed over , and she would have fallen had Louis not sprung forward and caught her in his arms . Her beautiful head drooped upon his shoulder , her breath was warm upon his cheek , and the subtle scent of her hair was in his nostrils . His arm , as he held her , rose and fell with her bosom , and he felt her heart , beneath his hand , fluttering like a caged bird . Her broad white throat was thrown back , her eyes almost closed , her lips just parted enough to show the line of pearly teeth , her beautiful face not three inches from his own . And then suddenly the eyelids quivered , and the great blue eyes looked up at him , lovingly , appealingly , half deprecating , half challenging , her whole soul in a glance . Did he move ? or was it she ? Who could tell ? But their lips had met in a long kiss , and then in another , and plans and resolutions were streaming away from Louis like autumn leaves in the west wind . `` Then I am not to go ? You would not have the heart to send me away , would you ? `` `` No , no ; but you must not annoy me , Francoise . `` `` I had rather die than cause you an instant of grief . Oh , sire , I have seen so little of you lately ! And I love you so ! It has maddened me . And then that dreadful woman -- - '' '' Who , then ? `` `` Oh , I must not speak against her . I will be civil for your sake even to her , the widow of old Scarron . `` ``
