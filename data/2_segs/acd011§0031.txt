man Shafter 's . The house was forbidden him ; but when he tapped at the window Ettie came out to him . The dancing Irish deviltry had gone from her lover 's eyes . She read his danger in his earnest face . `` Something has happened ! '' she cried . `` Oh , Jack , you are in danger ! `` `` Sure , it is not very bad , my sweetheart . And yet it may be wise that we make a move before it is worse . `` `` Make a move ? `` `` I promised you once that I would go some day . I think the time is coming . I had news to-night , bad news , and I see trouble coming . `` `` The police ? `` `` Well , a Pinkerton . But , sure , you would n't know what that is , acushla , nor what it may mean to the likes of me . I 'm too deep in this thing , and I may have to get out of it quick . You said you would come with me if I went . `` `` Oh , Jack , it would be the saving of you ! `` `` I 'm an honest man in some things , Ettie . I would n't hurt a hair of your bonny head for all that the world can give , nor ever pull you down one inch from the golden throne above the clouds where I always see you . Would you trust me ? `` She put her hand in his without a word . `` Well , then , listen to what I say , and do as I order you , for indeed it 's the only way for us . Things are going to happen in this valley . I feel it in my bones . There may be many of us that will have to look out for ourselves . I 'm one , anyhow . If I go , by day or night , it 's you that must come with me ! `` `` I 'd come after you , Jack . `` `` No , no , you shall come WITH me . If this valley is closed to me and I can never come back , how can I leave you behind , and me perhaps in hiding from the police with never a chance of a message ? It 's with me you must come . I know a good woman in the place I come from , and it 's there I 'd leave you till we can get married . Will you come ? `` `` Yes , Jack , I will come . `` `` God bless you for your trust in me ! It 's a fiend out of hell that I should be if I abused it . Now , mark you , Ettie , it will be just a word to you , and when it reaches you , you will drop everything and come right down to the waiting room at the depot and stay there till I come for you . `` `` Day or night , I 'll come at the word , Jack . `` Somewhat eased in mind , now that his own preparations for escape had been begun , McMurdo went on to the lodge . It had already assembled , and only by complicated signs and countersigns could he pass through the outer guard and inner guard who close-tiled it . A buzz of pleasure and welcome greeted him as he entered . The long room was crowded , and through the haze of tobacco smoke he saw the tangled black mane of the Bodymaster , the cruel , unfriendly features of Baldwin , the vulture face of Harraway , the secretary , and a dozen more who were among the leaders of the lodge . He rejoiced that they should all be there to take counsel over his news . `` Indeed , it 's glad we are to see you , Brother ! '' cried the chairman . `` There 's business here that wants a Solomon in judgment to set it right . `` `` It 's Lander and Egan , '' explained his neighbour as he took his seat . `` They both claim the head money given by the lodge for the shooting of old man Crabbe over at Stylestown , and who 's to say which fired the bullet ? `` McMurdo rose in his place and raised his hand . The expression of his face froze the attention of the audience . There was a dead hush of expectation . `` Eminent Bodymaster , '' he said , in a solemn voice , `` I claim urgency ! `` `` Brother McMurdo claims urgency , '' said McGinty . `` It 's a claim that by the rules of this lodge takes precedence . Now Brother , we attend you . `` McMurdo took the letter from his pocket . `` Eminent Bodymaster and Brethren , '' he said , `` I am the bearer of ill news this day ; but it is better that it should be known and discussed , than that a blow should fall upon us without warning which would destroy us all . I have information that the most powerful and richest organizations in this state have bound themselves together for our destruction , and that at this very moment there is a Pinkerton detective , one Birdy Edwards , at work in the valley collecting the evidence which may put a rope round the necks of many of us , and send every man in this room into a felon 's cell . That is the situation for the discussion of which I have made a claim of urgency . `` There was a dead silence in the room . It was broken by the chairman . `` What is your evidence for this , Brother McMurdo ? '' he asked . `` It is in this letter which has come into my hands , '' said McMurdo . He read the passage aloud . `` It is a matter of honour with me that I can give no further particulars about the letter , nor put it into your hands ; but I assure you that there is nothing else in it which can affect the interests of the lodge . I put the case before you as it has reached me . `` `` Let me say , Mr. Chairman , '' said one of the older brethren , `` that I have heard of Birdy Edwards , and that he has the name of being the best man in the Pinkerton service . `` `` Does anyone know him by sight ? '' asked McGinty . `` Yes , '' said McMurdo , `` I do . `` There was a murmur of astonishment through the hall . `` I believe we hold him in the hollow of our hands , '' he continued with an exulting smile upon his face . `` If we act quickly and wisely , we can cut this thing short . If I have your confidence and your help , it is little that we have to fear . `` `` What have we to fear , anyhow ? What can he know of our affairs ? `` `` You might say so if all were as stanch as you , Councillor . But this man has all the millions of the capitalists at his back . Do you think there is no weaker brother among all our lodges that could not be bought ? He will get at our secrets -- -maybe has got them already . There 's only one sure cure . `` `` That he never leaves the valley , '' said Baldwin.McMurdo nodded . `` Good for you , Brother Baldwin , '' he said . `` You and I have had our differences , but you have said the true word to-night . `` `` Where is he , then ? Where shall we know him ? `` `` Eminent Bodymaster , '' said McMurdo , earnestly , `` I would put it to you that this is too vital a thing for us to discuss in open lodge . God forbid that I should throw a doubt on anyone here ; but if so much as a word of gossip got to the ears of this man , there would be an end of any chance of our getting him . I would ask the lodge to choose a trusty committee , Mr. Chairman -- -yourself , if I might suggest it , and Brother Baldwin here , and five more . Then I can talk freely of what I know and of what I advise should be done . `` The proposition was at once adopted , and the committee chosen . Besides the chairman and Baldwin there were the vulture-faced secretary , Harraway , Tiger Cormac , the brutal young assassin , Carter , the treasurer , and the brothers Willaby , fearless and desperate men who would stick at nothing.The usual revelry of the lodge was short and subdued : for there was a cloud upon the men 's spirits , and many there for the first time began to see the cloud of avenging Law drifting up in that serene sky under which they had dwelt so long . The horrors they had dealt out to others had been so much a part of their settled lives that the thought of retribution had become a remote one , and so seemed the more startling now that it came so closely upon them . They broke up early and left their leaders to their council . `` Now , McMurdo ! '' said McGinty when they were alone . The seven men sat frozen in their seats . `` I said just now that I knew Birdy Edwards , '' McMurdo explained . `` I need not tell you that he is not here under that name . He 's a brave man , but not a crazy one . He passes under the name of Steve Wilson , and he is lodging at Hobson 's Patch . `` `` How do you know this ? `` `` Because I fell into talk with him . I thought little of it at the time , nor would have given it a second thought but for this letter ; but now I 'm sure it 's the man . I met him on the cars when I went down the line on Wednesday -- -a hard case if ever there was one . He said he was a reporter . I believed it for the moment . Wanted to know all he could about the Scowrers and what he called 'the outrages ' for a New York paper . Asked me every kind of question so as to get something . You bet I was giving nothing away . 'I 'd pay for it and pay well , ' said he , 'if I could get some stuff that would suit my editor . ' I said what I thought would please him best , and he handed me a twenty-dollar bill for my information . 'There 's ten times that for you , ' said he , 'if you can find me all that I want . ' '' '' What did you tell him , then ? `` `` Any stuff I could make up . `` `` How do you know he was n't a newspaper man ? `` `` I 'll tell you . He got out
