substantial , but he recognized with a trader 's instinct that the article was a superior one , and he was content to allow for the quality in estimating the value.Early one April afternoon the major was strutting down St. James 's Street , frock-coated and kid-gloved , with protuberant chest and glittering shoes which peeped out from beneath the daintiest of gaiters . Young Girdlestone , who had been on the look-out from a club window , ran across and intercepted him . `` How are you , my dear major ? '' he cried , advancing upon him with outstretched hand and as much show of geniality as his nature permitted . `` How d 'ye do ? How d 'ye do ? '' said the other somewhat pompously . He had made up his mind that nothing was to be done with the young man , and yet he was reluctant to break entirely with one whose purse was well lined and who had sporting proclivities . `` I 've been wishing to speak with you for some days , major , '' said Ezra . `` When could I see you ? `` `` You 'll niver see me any plainer than you do at this very moment , '' the old soldier answered , taking a sidelong glance of suspicion at his companion . `` Ah , but I wish to speak to you quietly on a matter of business , '' the young merchant persisted . `` It 's a delicate matter which may need some talking over , and , above all , it is a private matter. '' '' Ged ! '' said the major , with a wheezy laugh , `` you 'd have thought I wanted to borrow money if I had said as much . Look here now , we 'll go into White 's private billiard-room , and I 'll let you have two hunthred out of five for a tinner -- -though it 's as good as handing you the money to offer you such odds . You can talk this over while we play . `` `` No , no , major , '' urged the junior partner . `` I tell you it is a matter of the greatest importance to both of us . Can you meet me at Nelson 's Cafe at four o'clock ? I know the manager , and he 'll let us have a private room . `` `` I 'd ask you round to me own little place , '' the major said , `` but it 's rather too far . Nelson 's at four . Right you are ! 'Punctuality is next to godliness , ' as ould Willoughby of the Buffs used to say . You did n't know Willoughby , eh ? Gad , he was second to a man at Gib in '47 . He brought his man on the ground , but the opponents did n't turn up . Two minutes after time Willoughby wanted his man to leave . 'Teach 'em punctuality , ' he said . 'Ca n't be done , ' said his man. ' Mustbe done , ' said Willoughby . 'Out of the question , ' said the man , and would n't budge . Willoughby persisted ; there were high words and a quarrel . The docther put 'em up at fifteen paces , and the man shot Willoughby through the calf of the leg . He was a martyr to punctuality . Four o'clock-bye , bye ! '' The major nodded pleasantly and swaggered away , flourishing his little cane jauntily in the air.In spite of his admiration of punctuality , as exemplified in the person of Willoughby of the Buffs , the major took good care to arrive at the trysting-place somewhat behind the appointed time . It was clear to him that some service or other was expected of him , and it was obviously his game therefore to hang back and not appear to be too eager to enter into young Girdlestone 's views . When he presented himself at the entrance of Nelson 's Cafe the young merchant had been fuming and chafing in the sitting-room for five and twenty minutes.It was a dingy apartment , with a single large horse-hair chair and half a dozen small wooden dittoes , placed with mathematical precision along the walls . A square table in the centre and a shabby mirror over the mantelpiece completed the furniture . With the instinct of an old campaigner the major immediately dropped into the arm-chair , and , leaning luxuriously back , took a cigar from his case and proceeded to light it . Ezra Girdlestone seated himself near the table and twisted his dark moustache , as was his habit when collecting himself . `` What will you drink ? '' he asked , '' Anything that 's going . `` `` Fetch in a decanter of brandy and some seltzer water , '' said Ezra to the waiter ; `` then shut the door and leave us entirely to ourselves . `` When the liquor was placed upon the table he drank off his first glass at a gulp , and then refilled it . The major placed his upon the mantelpiece beside him without tasting it . Both were endeavouring to be at their best and clearest in the coming interview , and each set about it in his own manner . `` I 'll tell you why I wanted to have a chat with you , major , '' Ezra said , having first opened the door suddenly and glanced out as a precaution against eavesdroppers . `` I have to be cautious , because what I have to say affects the interest of the firm . I would n't for the world have any one know about it except yourself . `` `` What is it , me boy ? '' the major asked , with languid curiosity , puffing at his weed and staring up at the smoke-blackened ceiling . `` You understand that in commercial speculations the least breath of information beforehand may mean a loss of thousands on thousands . `` The major nodded his head as a sign that he appreciated this fact . `` We have a difficult enterprise on which we are about to embark , '' Ezra said , leaning forward and sinking his voice almost to a whisper . `` It is one which will need great skill and tact , though it may be made to pay well if properly managed . You follow me ? `` His companion nodded once more . `` For this enterprise we require an agent to perform one of the principal parts . This agent must possess great ability , and , at the same time , be a man on whom we can thoroughly rely . Of course we do not expect to find such qualities without paying for them . `` The major grunted a hearty acquiescence . `` My father , '' continued Ezra , `` wanted to employ one of our own men.We have numbers who are capable in every way of managing the business.I interfered , however . I said that I had a good friend , named MajorTobias Clutterbuck , who was well qualified for the position.I mentioned that you were of the blood of the old Silesian kings . Was Inot right ? `` `` Begad you were not . Milesian , sir ; Milesian ! `` `` Ah , Milesian . It 's all the same . `` `` It 's nothing of the sort , '' said the major indignantly . `` I mean it was all the same to my father . He would n't know the difference . Well , I told him of your high descent , and that you were a traveller , a soldier , and a man of steady and trustworthy habits. '' '' Eh ? '' ejaculated the major involuntarily . `` Well , all right . Go on ! `` `` I told him all this , '' said Ezra slowly , `` and I pointed out to him that the sum of money which he was prepared to lay out would be better expended on such a man than on one who had no virtues beyond those of business . `` `` I did n't give you credit for so much sinse ! '' his companion exclaimed with enthusiasm . `` I said to him that if the matter were left entirely in your hands we could rely upon its being done thoroughly . At the same time , we should have the satisfaction of knowing that the substantial sum which we are prepared to pay our agent had come into worthy hands . `` `` You hit it there again , '' murmured the veteran . `` You are prepared , then , '' said Ezra , glancing keenly at him , `` to put yourself at our orders on condition that you are well paid for it ? `` `` Not so fast , me young friend , not so fast ! '' said the major , taking his cigar from between his lips and letting the blue smoke curl round his head . `` Let 's hear what it is that you want me to do , and then I 'm riddy to say what I 'll agree to and what I wo n't . I remimber Jimmy Baxter in Texas -- - '' '' Hang Jimmy Baxter ! '' Ezra cried impatiently . `` That 's been done already , '' observed the major calmly . `` Lynched for horse-stealing in '66 . However , go on , and I 'll promise not to stop you until you have finished . `` Thus encouraged , Ezra proceeded to unfold the plan upon which the fortunes of the House of Girdlestone depended . Not a word did he say of ruin or danger , or the reasons which had induced this speculation . On the contrary , he depicted the affairs of the firm as being in a most nourishing condition , and this venture as simply a small insignificant offshoot from their business , undertaken as much for amusement as for any serious purpose . Still , he laid stress upon the fact that though the sum in question was a small one to the firm , yet it was a very large one in other men 's eyes . As to the morality of the scheme , that was a point which Ezra omitted entirely to touch upon . Any comment upon that would , he felt , be superfluous when dealing with such a man as his companion . `` And now , major , '' he concluded , `` provided you lend us your name and your talents to help us in our speculation , the firm are prepared to meet you in a most liberal spirit in the matter of remuneration . Of course your voyage and your expenses will be handsomely paid . You will have to travel by steamer to St. Petersburg , provided that we choose the Ural Mountains as the scene of our imaginary find . I hear that there is high play going on aboard these boats , and with your well-known skill you will no doubt be able to make the voyage a remunerative one . We calculate that at the most you will be in Russia about three months . Now , the firm thought that it would be very fair if they were to guarantee you two hundred and fifty pounds , which they would increase to five hundred in case of success ; of course by that we mean complete success , such
