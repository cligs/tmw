expression played over his grim features that he was hardly to be recognized as the revered elder of the Trinitarian Chapel or the esteemed man of business of Fenchurch Street.He was lost in thought for some little time , and then , rising , he touched the bell upon the table . Gilray trotted in upon the signal so rapidly and noiselessly , that he might have been one of those convenient genii in the Eastern fables , only that the little clerk 's appearance , from the tips of his ink-stained fingers to the toes of his seedy boots , was so hopelessly prosaic that it was impossible to picture him as anything but what he was . `` Ah , Gilray ! '' the merchant began , `` is Mr. Dimsdale in the office ? `` `` Yes , sir . `` `` That 's all right . He seems to be very regular in his attendance . `` `` Very , sir . `` `` And seems to take to the business very well . `` `` Uncommonly quick , sir , to be sure , '' said the head clerk . `` What with work among the ships , and work in the office , he 's at it late and early . `` `` That is very right , '' said the old man , playing with the letter weights . `` Application in youth , Gilray , leads to leisure in old age . Is theMaid of Athensunloading ? '' '' Mr . Dimsdale has been down to her this morning , sir . They 're getting the things out fast . He wants to call attention to the state of the vessel , Mr. Girdlestone . He says that it 's making water even in dock , and that some of the hands say that they wo n't go back in her. '' '' Tut ! tut ! '' John Girdlestone said peevishly . `` What are the Government inspectors for ? There is no use paying them if we are to inspect ourselves . If they insist upon any alterations they shall be made . `` `` They were there , sir , at the same time as Mr. Dimsdale , '' said Gilray , diffidently . `` Well , what then ? '' asked his employer . `` He says , sir , that the inspectors went down to the cabin and had some champagne with Captain Spender . They then professed themselves to be very well satisfied with the state of the vessel and came away . `` `` There you are ! '' the senior partner cried triumphantly . `` Of course these men can see at a glance how things stand , and if things had really been wrong they would have called attention to it . Let us have no more of these false alarms . You must say a few words on the point to Mr. Dimsdale , as coming from yourself , not from me . Tell him to be more careful before he jumps to conclusions . `` `` I will , sir . `` `` And bring me ledger No . 33 . `` Gilray stretched up his arm and took down a fat little ledger from a high shelf , which he laid respectfully before his employer . Then , seeing that he was no longer wanted , he withdrew.Ledger No . 33 was secured by a clasp and lock -- -the latter a patent one which defied all tamperers . John Girdlestone took a small key from his pocket and opened it with a quick snap . A precious volume this , for it was the merchant 's private book , which alone contained a true record of the financial state of the firm , all others being made merely for show . Without it he would have been unable to keep his son in the dark for so many months until bitter necessity at last compelled him to show his hand.He turned the pages over slowly and sadly . Here was a record of the sums sunk in the Lake Tanganyika Gold Company , which was to have paid 33 per cent. , and which fell to pieces in the second month of its existence . Here was the money advanced to Durer , Hallett , & Co. , on the strength of securities which proved to be the flimsiest of insecurities when tested . Further on was the account of the dealings of the firm with the Levant Petroleum Company , the treasurer of which had levanted with the greater part of the capital . Here , too , was a memorandum of the sums sunk upon theEvening Starand theProvidence , whose unfortunate collision had well-nigh proved the death blow of the firm . It was melancholy reading , and perhaps the last page was the most melancholy of all . On it the old man had drawn up in a condensed form an exact account of the present condition of the firm 's finances . Here it is exactly word for word as he had written it down himself .

He leaned back in his chair and looked up at the ceiling with a much more cheerful expression upon his face . `` At the worst it is less than thirty thousand pounds . Why , many firms would think little of it . The fact is , that I have so long been accustomed to big balances on the right side that it seems to be a very dreadful thing now that it lies the other way . A dozen things may happen to set all right . I must not forget , however , '' he continued , with a darker look , `` that I have dipped into my credit so freely that I could not borrow any more without exciting suspicion and having the whole swarm down on us . After all , our hopes lie in the diamonds . Ezra can not fail . He must succeed . Who can prevent him ? `` `` Major Tobias Clutterbuck , '' cried the sharp , creaky voice of Gilray as if in answer to the question , and the little clerk , who had knocked once or twice unnoticed , opened the door and ushered in the old Campaigner . [ 1 ] It may be well to remark , that this and succeeding incidents occurred in the old Crown Colony days , before the diamond legislation was as strict as it has since become.John Girdlestone had frequently heard his son speak of the major in the days when they had been intimate , and had always attributed some of the young man 's more obvious vices to the effects of this ungodly companionship . He had also heard from Ezra a mangled version of the interview and quarrel in the private room of Nelson 's Restaurant . Hence , as may be imagined , his feelings towards his visitor were far from friendly , and he greeted him as he entered with the coldest of possible bows . The major , however , was by no means abashed by this chilling reception , but stumped forward with beaming face and his pudgy hand outstretched , so that the other had no alternative but to shake it , which he did very gingerly and reluctantly . `` And how are ye ? '' said the major , stepping back a pace or two , and inspecting the merchant as though he were examining his points with the intention of purchasing him . `` Many 's the time I 've heard talk of ye . It 's a real treat to see ye . How are ye ? '' Pouncing upon the other 's unresponsive hand , he wrung it again with effusion . `` I am indebted to Providence for fairly good health , sir , '' JohnGirdlestone answered coldly . `` May I request you to take a seat ? `` `` That was what me friend Fagan was trying to do for twelve years , and ruined himself over it in the ind . He put up at Murphytown in the Conservative interest , and the divil a vote did he get , except one , and that was a blind man who signed the wrong paper be mistake , Ha ! ha ! '' The major laughed boisterously at his own anecdote , and mopped his forehead with his handkerchief.The two men , as they stood opposite each other , were a strange contrast , the one tall , grave , white , and emotionless , the other noisy and pompous , with protuberant military chest and rubicund features . They had one common characteristic , however . From under the shaggy eyebrows of the merchant and the sparse light-coloured lashes of the major there came the same keen , restless , shifting glance . Both were crafty , and each was keenly on his guard against the other . `` I have heard of you from my son , '' the merchant said , motioning his visitor to a chair . `` You were , I believe , in the habit of meeting together for the purpose of playing cards , billiards , and other such games , which I by no means countenance myself , but to which my son is unhappily somewhat addicted . `` `` You do n't play yourself , '' said the major , in a sympathetic voice . `` Ged , sir , it 's never too late to begin , and many a man has put in a very comfortable old age On billiards and whist . Now , if ye feel inclined to make a start , I 'll give ye seventy-five points in a hundred for a commincement . `` `` Thank you , '' said the merchant drily . `` It is not one of my ambitions.Was this challenge the business upon which you came ? `` The old soldier laughed until his merriment startled the clerks in the counting-house . `` Be jabers ! '' he said , In a wheezy voice , `` d 'ye think I came five miles to do that ? No , sir , I wanted to talk to you about your son . `` `` My son ! `` `` Yes , your son .
