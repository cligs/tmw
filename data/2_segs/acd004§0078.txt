! it is over it , '' cried Aylward . `` I can see where they have stooped to gather up the shaft . `` `` We shall hear anon , '' said Johnston quietly , and presently a young archer came running to say that the arrow had fallen twenty paces beyond the fourth wand . `` Four hundred paces and a score , '' cried Black Simon . `` I ' faith , it is a very long flight . Yet wood and steel may do more than flesh and blood . `` The Brabanter stepped forward with a smile of conscious triumph , and loosed the cord of his weapon . A shout burst from his comrades as they watched the swift and lofty flight of the heavy bolt . `` Over the fourth ! '' groaned Aylward . `` By my hilt ! I think that it is well up to the fifth . `` `` It is over the fifth ! '' cried a Gascon loudly , and a comrade came running with waving arms to say that the bolt had pitched eight paces beyond the mark of the five hundred . `` Which weapon hath the vantage now ? '' cried the Brabanter , strutting proudly about with shouldered arbalest , amid the applause of his companions . `` You can overshoot me , '' said Johnston gently . `` Or any other man who ever bent a long-bow , '' cried his victorious adversary . `` Nay , not so fast , '' said a huge archer , whose mighty shoulders and red head towered high above the throng of his comrades . `` I must have a word with you ere you crow so loudly . Where is my little popper ? By sainted Dick of Hampole ! it will be a strange thing if I can not outshoot that thing of thine , which to my eyes is more like a rat-trap than a bow . Will you try another flight , or do you stand by your last ? `` `` Five hundred and eight paces will serve my turn , '' answered the Brabanter , looking askance at this new opponent . `` Tut , John , '' whispered Aylward , `` you never were a marksman . Why must you thrust your spoon into this dish ? `` `` Easy and slow , Aylward . There are very many things which I can not do , but there are also one or two which I have the trick of . It is in my mind that I can beat this shoot , if my bow will but hold together . `` `` Go on , old babe of the woods ! '' `` Have at it , Hampshire ! '' cried the archers laughing . `` By my soul ! you may grin , '' cried John . `` But I learned how to make the long shoot from old Hob Miller of Milford . '' He took up a great black bow , as he spoke , and sitting down upon the ground he placed his two feet on either end of the stave . With an arrow fitted , he then pulled the string towards him with both hands until the head of the shaft was level with the wood . The great bow creaked and groaned and the cord vibrated with the tension . `` Who is this fool's-head who stands in the way of my shoot ? '' said he , craning up his neck from the ground . `` He stands on the further side of my mark , '' answered the Brabanter , `` so he has little to fear from you . `` `` Well , the saints assoil him ! '' cried John . `` Though I think he is over-near to be scathed . '' As he spoke he raised his two feet , with the bow-stave upon their soles , and his cord twanged with a deep rich hum which might be heard across the valley . The measurer in the distance fell flat upon his face , and then jumping up again , he began to run in the opposite direction . `` Well shot , old lad ! It is indeed over his head , '' cried the bowmen . `` Mon Dieu ! '' exclaimed the Brabanter , `` who ever saw such a shoot ? `` `` It is but a trick , '' quoth John . `` Many a time have I won a gallon of ale by covering a mile in three flights down Wilverley Chase . `` `` It fell a hundred and thirty paces beyond the fifth mark , '' shouted an archer in the distance . `` Six hundred and thirty paces ! Mon Dieu ! but that is a shoot ! And yet it says nothing for your weapon , mon gros camarade , for it was by turning yourself into a crossbow that you did it . `` `` By my hilt ! there is truth in that , '' cried Aylward . `` And now , friend , I will myself show you a vantage of the long-bow . I pray you to speed a bolt against yonder shield with all your force . It is an inch of elm with bull 's hide over it . `` `` I scarce shot as many shafts at Brignais , '' growled the man of Brabant ; `` though I found a better mark there than a cantle of bull 's hide . But what is this , Englishman ? The shield hangs not one hundred paces from me , and a blind man could strike it . '' He screwed up his string to the furthest pitch , and shot his quarrel at the dangling shield . Aylward , who had drawn an arrow from his quiver , carefully greased the head of it , and sped it at the same mark . `` Run , Wilkins , '' quoth he , `` and fetch me the shield . `` Long were the faces of the Englishmen and broad the laugh of the crossbowmen as the heavy mantlet was carried towards them , for there in the centre was the thick Brabant bolt driven deeply into the wood , while there was neither sign nor trace of the cloth-yard shaft . `` By the three kings ! '' cried the Brabanter , `` this time at least there is no gainsaying which is the better weapon , or which the truer hand that held it . You have missed the shield , Englishman . `` `` Tarry a bit ! tarry a bit , mon gar. ! '' quoth Aylward , and turning round the shield he showed a round clear hole in the wood at the back of it . `` My shaft has passed through it , camarade , and I trow the one which goes through is more to be feared than that which bides on the way . `` The Brabanter stamped his foot with mortification , and was about to make some angry reply , when Alleyne Edricson came riding up to the crowds of archers . `` Sir Nigel will be here anon , '' said he , `` and it is his wish to speak with the Company . `` In an instant order and method took the place of general confusion . Bows , steel caps , and jacks were caught up from the grass . A long cordon cleared the camp of all strangers , while the main body fell into four lines with under-officers and file-leaders in front and on either flank . So they stood , silent and motionless , when their leader came riding towards them , his face shining and his whole small figure swelling with the news which he bore . `` Great honor has been done to us , men , '' cried he : `` for , of all the army , the prince has chosen us out that we should ride onwards into the lands of Spain to spy upon our enemies . Yet , as there are many of us , and as the service may not be to the liking of all , I pray that those will step forward from the ranks who have the will to follow me . `` There was a rustle among the bowmen , but when Sir Nigel looked up at them no man stood forward from his fellows , but the four lines of men stretched unbroken as before . Sir Nigel blinked at them in amazement , and a look of the deepest sorrow shadowed his face . `` That I should live to see the day ! '' he cried . `` What ! not one -- -- -- '' '' My fair lord , '' whispered Alleyne , `` they have all stepped forward . `` `` Ah , by Saint Paul ! I see how it is with them . I could not think that they would desert me . We start at dawn to-morrow , and ye are to have the horses of Sir Robert Cheney 's company . Be ready , I pray ye , at early cock-crow . `` A buzz of delight burst from the archers , as they broke their ranks and ran hither and thither , whooping and cheering like boys who have news of a holiday . Sir Nigel gazed after them with a smiling face , when a heavy hand fell upon his shoulder . `` What ho ! my knight-errant of Twynham ! '' said a voice , `` You are off to Ebro , I hear ; and , by the holy fish of Tobias ! you must take me under your banner. '' '' What ! Sir Oliver Buttesthorn ! '' cried Sir Nigel . `` I had heard that you were come into camp , and had hoped to see you . Glad and proud shall I be to have you with me . `` `` I have a most particular and weighty reason for wishing to go , '' said the sturdy knight . `` I can well believe it , '' returned Sir Nigel ; `` I have met no man who is quicker to follow where honor leads . `` `` Nay , it is not for honor that I go , Nigel . `` `` For what then ? `` `` For pullets. '' '' Pullets ? `` `` Yes , for the rascal vanguard have cleared every hen from the country-side . It was this very morning that Norbury , my squire , lamed his horse in riding round in quest of one , for we have a bag of truffles , and nought to eat with them . Never have I seen such locusts as this vanguard of ours . Not a pullet shall we see until we are in front of them ; so I shall leave my Winchester runagates to the care of the provost-marshal , and I shall hie south with you , Nigel , with my truffles at my saddle-bow . `` `` Oliver , Oliver , I know you over-well , '' said Sir Nigel , shaking his head , and the two old soldiers rode off together to their pavilion.To the south of Pampeluna in the kingdom of Navarre there stretched a high table-land , rising into bare , sterile hills , brown or gray in color , and strewn with huge boulders of granite . On the Gascon side of the great mountains there had been running streams , meadows , forests , and little nestling villages . Here , on the contrary , were nothing but naked rocks , poor pasture
