, and savage , stone-strewn wastes . Gloomy defiles or barrancas intersected this wild country with mountain torrents dashing and foaming between their rugged sides . The clatter of waters , the scream of the eagle , and the howling of wolves the only sounds which broke upon the silence in that dreary and inhospitable region.Through this wild country it was that Sir Nigel and his Company pushed their way , riding at times through vast defiles where the brown , gnarled cliffs shot up on either side of them , and the sky was but a long winding blue slit between the clustering lines of box which fringed the lips of the precipices ; or , again leading their horses along the narrow and rocky paths worn by the muleteers upon the edges of the chasm , where under their very elbows they could see the white streak which marked thegavewhich foamed a thousand feet below them . So for two days they pushed their way through the wild places of Navarre , past Fuente , over the rapid Ega , through Estella , until upon a winter 's evening the mountains fell away from in front of them , and they saw the broad blue Ebro curving betwixt its double line of homesteads and of villages . The fishers of Viana were aroused that night by rough voices speaking in a strange tongue , and ere morning Sir Nigel and his men had ferried the river and were safe upon the land of Spain.All the next day they lay in a pine wood near to the town of Logrono , resting their horses and taking counsel as to what they should do . Sir Nigel had with him Sir William Felton , Sir Oliver Buttesthorn , stout old Sir Simon Burley , the Scotch knight-errant , the Earl of Angus , and Sir Richard Causton , all accounted among the bravest knights in the army , together with sixty veteran men-at-arms , and three hundred and twenty archers . Spies had been sent out in the morning , and returned after nightfall to say that the King of Spain was encamped some fourteen miles off in the direction of Burgos , having with him twenty thousand horse and forty-five thousand foot.A dry-wood fire had been lit , and round this the leaders crouched , the glare beating upon their rugged faces , while the hardy archers lounged and chatted amid the tethered horses , while they munched their scanty provisions . `` For my part , '' said Sir Simon Burley , `` I am of opinion that we have already done that which we have come for . For do we not now know where the king is , and how great a following he hath , which was the end of our journey . `` `` True , '' answered Sir William Felton , `` but I have come on this venture because it is a long time since I have broken a spear in war , and , certes , I shall not go back until I have run a course with some cavalier of Spain . Let those go back who will , but I must see more of these Spaniards ere I turn . `` `` I will not leave you , Sir William , '' returned Sir Simon Burley ; `` and yet , as an old soldier and one who hath seen much of war , I can not but think that it is an ill thing for four hundred men to find themselves between an army of sixty thousand on the one side and a broad river on the other . `` `` Yet , '' said Sir Richard Causton , `` we can not for the honor of England go back without a blow struck . `` `` Nor for the honor of Scotland either , '' cried the Earl of Angus . `` By Saint Andrew ! I wish that I may never set eyes upon the water of Leith again , if I pluck my horse 's bridle ere I have seen this camp of theirs . `` `` By Saint Paul ! you have spoken very well , '' said Sir Nigel , `` and I have always heard that there were very worthy gentlemen among the Scots , and fine skirmishing to be had upon their border . Bethink you , Sir Simon , that we have this news from the lips of common spies , who can scarce tell us as much of the enemy and of his forces as the prince would wish to hear . `` `` You are the leader in this venture , Sir Nigel , '' the other answered , `` and I do but ride under your banner . `` `` Yet I would fain have your rede and counsel , Sir Simon . But , touching what you say of the river , we can take heed that we shall not have it at the back of us , for the prince hath now advanced to Salvatierra , and thence to Vittoria , so that if we come upon their camp from the further side we can make good our retreat . `` `` What then would you propose ? '' asked Sir Simon , shaking his grizzled head as one who is but half convinced . `` That we ride forward ere the news reach them that we have crossed the river . In this way we may have sight of their army , and perchance even find occasion for some small deed against them . `` `` So be it , then , '' said Sir Simon Burley ; and the rest of the council having approved , a scanty meal was hurriedly snatched , and the advance resumed under the cover of the darkness . All night they led their horses , stumbling and groping through wild defiles and rugged valleys , following the guidance of a frightened peasant who was strapped by the wrist to Black Simon 's stirrup-leather . With the early dawn they found themselves in a black ravine , with others sloping away from it on either side , and the bare brown crags rising in long bleak terraces all round them . `` If it please you , fair lord , '' said Black Simon , `` this man hath misled us , and since there is no tree upon which we may hang him , it might be well to hurl him over yonder cliff . `` The peasant , reading the soldier 's meaning in his fierce eyes and harsh accents dropped upon his knees , screaming loudly for mercy . `` How comes it , dog ? '' asked Sir William Felton in Spanish . `` Where is this camp to which you swore that you would lead us ? `` `` By the sweet Virgin ! By the blessed Mother of God ! '' cried the trembling peasant , `` I swear to you that in the darkness I have myself lost the path . `` `` Over the cliff with him ! '' shouted half a dozen voices ; but ere the archers could drag him from the rocks to which he clung Sir Nigel had ridden up and called upon them to stop . `` How is this , sirs ? '' said he . `` As long as the prince doth me the honor to entrust this venture to me , it is for me only to give orders ; and , by Saint Paul ! I shall be right blithe to go very deeply into the matter with any one to whom my words may give offence . How say you , Sir William ? Or you , my Lord of Angus ? Or you , Sir Richard ? `` `` Nay , nay , Nigel ! '' cried Sir William . `` This base peasant is too small a matter for old comrades to quarrel over . But he hath betrayed us , and certes he hath merited a dog 's death . `` `` Hark ye , fellow , '' said Sir Nigel . `` We give you one more chance to find the path . We are about to gain much honor , Sir William , in this enterprise , and it would be a sorry thing if the first blood shed were that of an unworthy boor . Let us say our morning orisons , and it may chance that ere we finish he may strike upon the track . `` With bowed heads and steel caps in hand , the archers stood at their horse 's heads , while Sir Simon Burley repeated the Pater , the Ave , and the Credo . Long did Alleyne bear the scene in mind -- -the knot of knights in their dull leaden-hued armor , the ruddy visage of Sir Oliver , the craggy features of the Scottish earl , the shining scalp of Sir Nigel , with the dense ring of hard , bearded faces and the long brown heads of the horses , all topped and circled by the beetling cliffs . Scarce had the last deep `` amen '' broken from the Company , when , in an instant , there rose the scream of a hundred bugles , with the deep rolling of drums and the clashing of cymbals , all sounding together in one deafening uproar . Knights and archers sprang to arms , convinced that some great host was upon them ; but the guide dropped upon his knees and thanked Heaven for its mercies . `` We have found them , caballeros ! '' he cried . `` This is their morning call . If ye will but deign to follow me , I will set them before you ere a man might tell his beads . `` As he spoke he scrambled down one of the narrow ravines , and , climbing over a low ridge at the further end , he led them into a short valley with a stream purling down the centre of it and a very thick growth of elder and of box upon either side . Pushing their way through the dense brushwood , they looked out upon a scene which made their hearts beat harder and their breath come faster.In front of them there lay a broad plain , watered by two winding streams and covered with grass , stretching away to where , in the furthest distance , the towers of Burgos bristled up against the light blue morning sky . Over all this vast meadow there lay a great city of tents -- -thousands upon thousands of them , laid out in streets and in squares like a well-ordered town . High silken pavilions or colored marquees , shooting up from among the crowd of meaner dwellings , marked where the great lords and barons of Leon and Castile displayed their standards , while over the white roofs , as far as eye could reach , the waving of ancients , pavons , pensils , and banderoles , with flash of gold and glow of colors , proclaimed that all the chivalry of Iberia were mustered in the plain beneath them . Far off , in the centre of the camp , a huge palace of red and white silk , with the royal arms of Castile waiving from the summit , announced that the gallant Henry lay there in the midst of his warriors.As the English adventurers , peeping out from behind their brushwood screen , looked down upon this wondrous sight they could see that the vast army in front of them was already afoot . The first pink light of the rising sun glittered upon the steel caps and breastplates
