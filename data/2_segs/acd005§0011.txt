in Paris ? `` `` A day. '' '' Heh ! And you already begin to throw your mother 's country-folk out of windows ! `` `` He was annoying a young maid , sir , and I asked him to stop , whereon he whipped out his sword , and would have slain me had I not closed with him , upon which he called upon his fellows to aid him . To keep them off , I swore that I would drop him over if they moved a step . Yet when I let him go , they set upon me again , and I know not what the end might have been had this gentleman not stood my friend. '' '' Hem ! You did very well . You are young , but you have resource . `` `` I was reared in the woods , sir . `` `` If there are many of your kidney , you may give my friend De Frontenac some work ere he found this empire of which he talks . But how is this , Captain Dalbert ? What have you to say ? `` `` The king 's orders , your Highness. '' '' Heh ! Did he order you to molest the girl ? I have never yet heard that his Majesty erred by being tooharshwith a woman . '' He gave a little dry chuckle in his throat , and took another pinch of snuff . `` The orders are , your Highness , to use every means which may drive these people into the true Church . `` `` On my word , you look a very fine apostle and a pretty champion for a holy cause , '' said Conde , glancing sardonically out of his twinkling black eyes at the brutal face of the dragoon . `` Take your men out of this , sir , and never venture to set your foot again across this threshold . `` `` But the king 's command , your Highness . `` `` I will tell the king when I see him that I left soldiers and that I find brigands . Not a word , sir ! Away ! You take your shame with you , and you leave your honour behind . '' He had turned in an instant from the sneering , strutting old beau to the fierce soldier with set face and eye of fire . Dalbert shrank back from his baleful gaze , and muttering an order to his men , they filed off down the stair with clattering feet and clank of sabres . `` Your Highness , '' said the old Huguenot , coming forward and throwing open one of the doors which led from the landing , `` you have indeed been a saviour of Israel and a stumbling-block to the froward this day . Will you not deign to rest under my roof , and even to take a cup of wine ere you go onwards ? `` Conde raised his thick eyebrows at the scriptural fashion of the merchant 's speech , but he bowed courteously to the invitation , and entered the chamber , looking around him in surprise and admiration at its magnificence . With its panelling of dark shining oak , its polished floor , its stately marble chimney-piece , and its beautifully moulded ceiling , it was indeed a room which might have graced a palace . `` My carriage waits below , '' said he , `` and I must not delay longer . It is not often that I leave my castle of Chantilly to come to Paris , and it was a fortunate chance which made me pass in time to be of service to honest men . When a house hangs out such a sign as an officer of dragoons with his heels in the air , it is hard to drive past without a question . But I fear that as long as you are a Huguenot , there will be no peace for you in France , monsieur . `` `` The law is indeed heavy upon us . `` `` And will be heavier if what I hear from court is correct . I wonder that you do not fly the country . `` `` My business and my duty lie here . `` `` Well , every man knows his own affairs best . Would it not be wise to bend to the storm , heh ? `` The Huguenot gave a gesture of horror . `` Well , well , I meant no harm . And where is this fair maid who has been the cause of the broil ? `` `` Where is Adele , Pierre ? '' asked the merchant of the old servant , who had carried in the silver tray with a squat flask and tinted Venetian glasses . `` I locked her in my room , master . `` `` And where is she now ? `` `` I am here , father . '' The young girl sprang into the room , and threw her arms round the old merchant 's neck . `` Oh , I trust these wicked men have not hurt you , love ! `` `` No , no , dear child ; none of us have been hurt , thanks to his Highness the Prince of Conde here . `` Adele raised her eyes , and quickly drooped them again before the keen questioning gaze of the old soldier . `` May God reward your Highness ! '' she stammered . In her confusion the blood rushed to her face , which was perfect in feature and expression . With her sweet delicate contour , her large gray eyes , and the sweep of the lustrous hair , setting off with its rich tint the little shell-like ears and the alabaster whiteness of the neck and throat , even Conde , who had seen all the beauties of three courts and of sixty years defile before him , stood staring in admiration at the Huguenot maiden. '' Heh ! On my word , mademoiselle , you make me wish that I could wipe forty years from my account . '' He bowed , and sighed in the fashion that was in vogue when Buckingham came to the wooing of Anne of Austria , and the dynasty of cardinals was at its height . `` France could ill spare those forty years , your Highness . `` `` Heh , heh ! So quick of tongue too ? Your daughter has a courtly wit , monsieur . `` `` God forbid , your Highness ! She is as pure and good -- - '' '' Nay , that is but a sorry compliment to the court . Surely , mademoiselle , you would love to go out into the great world , to hear sweet music , see all that is lovely , and wear all that is costly , rather than look out ever upon the Rue St. Martin , and bide in this great dark house until the roses wither upon your cheeks . `` `` Where my father is , I am happy at his side , '' said she , putting her two hands upon his sleeve . `` I ask nothing more than I have got . `` `` And I think it best that you go up to your room again , '' said the old merchant shortly , for the prince , in spite of his age , bore an evil name among women . He had come close to her as he spoke , and had even placed one yellow hand upon her shrinking arm , while his little dark eyes twinkled with an ominous light . `` Tut , tut ! '' said he , as she hastened to obey . `` You need not fear for your little dove . This hawk , at least , is far past the stoop , however tempting the quarry . But indeed , I can see that she is as good as she is fair , and one could not say more than that if she were from heaven direct . My carriage waits , gentlemen , and I wish you all a very good day ! '' He inclined his be-wigged head , and strutted off in his dainty , dandified fashion . From the window De Catinat could see him slip into the same gilded chariot which had stood in his way as he drove from Versailles . `` By my faith , '' said he , turning to the young American , `` we all owe thanks to the prince , but it seems to me , sir , that we are your debtors even more . You have risked your life for my cousin , and but for your cudgel , Dalbert would have had his blade through me when he had me at a vantage . Your hand , sir ! These are things which a man can not forget . `` `` Ay , you may well thank him , Amory , '' broke in the old Huguenot , who had returned after escorting his illustrious guest to the carriage . `` He has been raised up as a champion for the afflicted , and as a helper for those who are in need . An old man 's blessing upon you , Amos Green , for my own son could not have done for me more than you , a stranger . `` But their young visitor appeared to be more embarrassed by their thanks than by any of his preceding adventures . The blood flushed to his weather-tanned , clear-cut face , as smooth as that of a boy , and yet marked by a firmness of lip and a shrewdness in the keen blue eyes which spoke of a strong and self-reliant nature . `` I have a mother and two sisters over the water , '' said he diffidently . `` And you honour women for their sake ? `` `` We always honour women over there . Perhaps it is that we have so few . Over in these old countries you have not learned what it is to be without them . I have been away up the lakes for furs , living for months on end the life of a savage among the wigwams of the Sacs and the Foxes , foul livers and foul talkers , ever squatting like toads around their fires . Then when I have come back to Albany where my folk then dwelt , and have heard my sisters play upon the spinet and sing , and my mother talk to us of the France of her younger days and of her childhood , and of all that they had suffered for what they thought was right , then I have felt what a good woman is , and how , like the sunshine , she draws out of one 's soul all that is purest and best . `` `` Indeed , the ladies should be very much obliged to monsieur , who is as eloquent as he is brave , '' said Adele Catinat , who , standing in the open door , had listened to the latter part of his remarks.He had forgotten himself for the instant , and had spoken freely and with energy . At the sight of the girl , however , he coloured up again , and cast down his eyes . `` Much of my life has been spent in the woods , '' said he , `` and one speaks so little there that one comes to forget how to do it . It was for this that my
