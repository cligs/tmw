another . His dashing manner and fearlessness of speech made him a favourite with them all ; while the rapid and scientific way in which he polished off his antagonist in an `` all in '' bar-room scrap earned the respect of that rough community . Another incident , however , raised him even higher in their estimation.Just at the crowded hour one night , the door opened and a man entered with the quiet blue uniform and peaked cap of the mine police . This was a special body raised by the railways and colliery owners to supplement the efforts of the ordinary civil police , who were perfectly helpless in the face of the organized ruffianism which terrorized the district . There was a hush as he entered , and many a curious glance was cast at him ; but the relations between policemen and criminals are peculiar in some parts of the States , and McGinty himself , standing behind his counter , showed no surprise when the policeman enrolled himself among his customers . `` A straight whisky ; for the night is bitter , '' said the police officer . `` I do n't think we have met before , Councillor ? `` `` You 'll be the new captain ? '' said McGinty . `` That 's so . We 're looking to you , Councillor , and to the other leading citizens , to help us in upholding law and order in this township . Captain Marvin is my name . `` `` We 'd do better without you , Captain Marvin , '' said McGinty coldly ; `` for we have our own police of the township , and no need for any imported goods . What are you but the paid tool of the capitalists , hired by them to club or shoot your poorer fellow citizen ? `` `` Well , well , we wo n't argue about that , '' said the police officer good-humouredly . `` I expect we all do our duty same as we see it ; but we ca n't all see it the same . '' He had drunk off his glass and had turned to go , when his eyes fell upon the face of Jack McMurdo , who was scowling at his elbow . `` Hullo ! Hullo ! '' he cried , looking him up and down . `` Here 's an old acquaintance ! `` McMurdo shrank away from him . `` I was never a friend to you nor any other cursed copper in my life , '' said he . `` An acquaintance is n't always a friend , '' said the police captain , grinning . `` You 're Jack McMurdo of Chicago , right enough , and do n't you deny it ! `` McMurdo shrugged his shoulders . `` I 'm not denying it , '' said he . `` D 'ye think I 'm ashamed of my own name ? `` `` You 've got good cause to be , anyhow . `` `` What the devil d'you mean by that ? '' he roared with his fists clenched . `` No , no , Jack , bluster wo n't do with me . I was an officer in Chicago before ever I came to this darned coal bunker , and I know a Chicago crook when I see one . `` McMurdo 's face fell . `` Do n't tell me that you 're Marvin of the Chicago Central ! '' he cried . `` Just the same old Teddy Marvin , at your service . We have n't forgotten the shooting of Jonas Pinto up there . `` `` I never shot him . `` `` Did you not ? That 's good impartial evidence , ai n't it ? Well , his death came in uncommon handy for you , or they would have had you for shoving the queer . Well , we can let that be bygones ; for , between you and me -- -and perhaps I 'm going further than my duty in saying it -- -they could get no clear case against you , and Chicago 's open to you to-morrow . `` `` I 'm very well where I am . `` `` Well , I 've given you the pointer , and you 're a sulky dog not to thank me for it . `` `` Well , I suppose you mean well , and I do thank you , '' said McMurdo in no very gracious manner . `` It 's mum with me so long as I see you living on the straight , '' said the captain . `` But , by the Lord ! if you get off after this , it 's another story ! So good-night to you -- -and good-night , Councillor . `` He left the bar-room ; but not before he had created a local hero . McMurdo 's deeds in far Chicago had been whispered before . He had put off all questions with a smile , as one who did not wish to have greatness thrust upon him . But now the thing was officially confirmed . The bar loafers crowded round him and shook him heartily by the hand . He was free of the community from that time on . He could drink hard and show little trace of it ; but that evening , had his mate Scanlan not been at hand to lead him home , the feted hero would surely have spent his night under the bar.On a Saturday night McMurdo was introduced to the lodge . He had thought to pass in without ceremony as being an initiate of Chicago ; but there were particular rites in Vermissa of which they were proud , and these had to be undergone by every postulant . The assembly met in a large room reserved for such purposes at the Union House . Some sixty members assembled at Vermissa ; but that by no means represented the full strength of the organization , for there were several other lodges in the valley , and others across the mountains on each side , who exchanged members when any serious business was afoot , so that a crime might be done by men who were strangers to the locality . Altogether there were not less than five hundred scattered over the coal district.In the bare assembly room the men were gathered round a long table . At the side was a second one laden with bottles and glasses , on which some members of the company were already turning their eyes . McGinty sat at the head with a flat black velvet cap upon his shock of tangled black hair , and a coloured purple stole round his neck , so that he seemed to be a priest presiding over some diabolical ritual . To right and left of him were the higher lodge officials , the cruel , handsome face of Ted Baldwin among them . Each of these wore some scarf or medallion as emblem of his office.They were , for the most part , men of mature age ; but the rest of the company consisted of young fellows from eighteen to twenty-five , the ready and capable agents who carried out the commands of their seniors . Among the older men were many whose features showed the tigerish , lawless souls within ; but looking at the rank and file it was difficult to believe that these eager and open-faced young fellows were in very truth a dangerous gang of murderers , whose minds had suffered such complete moral perversion that they took a horrible pride in their proficiency at the business , and looked with deepest respect at the man who had the reputation of making what they called `` a clean job . `` To their contorted natures it had become a spirited and chivalrous thing to volunteer for service against some man who had never injured them , and whom in many cases they had never seen in their lives . The crime committed , they quarrelled as to who had actually struck the fatal blow , and amused one another and the company by describing the cries and contortions of the murdered man.At first they had shown some secrecy in their arrangements ; but at the time which this narrative describes their proceedings were extraordinarily open , for the repeated failure of the law had proved to them that , on the one hand , no one would dare to witness against them , and on the other they had an unlimited number of stanch witnesses upon whom they could call , and a well-filled treasure chest from which they could draw the funds to engage the best legal talent in the state . In ten long years of outrage there had been no single conviction , and the only danger that ever threatened the Scowrers lay in the victim himself -- -who , however outnumbered and taken by surprise , might and occasionally did leave his mark upon his assailants.McMurdo had been warned that some ordeal lay before him ; but no one would tell him in what it consisted . He was led now into an outer room by two solemn brothers . Through the plank partition he could hear the murmur of many voices from the assembly within . Once or twice he caught the sound of his own name , and he knew that they were discussing his candidacy . Then there entered an inner guard with a green and gold sash across his chest . `` The Bodymaster orders that he shall be trussed , blinded , and entered , '' said he.The three of them removed his coat , turned up the sleeve of his right arm , and finally passed a rope round above the elbows and made it fast . They next placed a thick black cap right over his head and the upper part of his face , so that he could see nothing . He was then led into the assembly hall.It was pitch dark and very oppressive under his hood . He heard the rustle and murmur of the people round him , and then the voice of McGinty sounded dull and distant through the covering of his ears . `` John McMurdo , '' said the voice , `` are you already a member of the Ancient Order of Freemen ? `` He bowed in assent . `` Is your lodge No . 29 , Chicago ? `` He bowed again . `` Dark nights are unpleasant , '' said the voice . `` Yes , for strangers to travel , '' he answered . `` The clouds are heavy . `` `` Yes , a storm is approaching . `` `` Are the brethren satisfied ? '' asked the Bodymaster.There was a general murmur of assent . `` We know , Brother , by your sign and by your countersign that you are indeed one of us , '' said McGinty . `` We would have you know , however , that in this county and in other counties of these parts we have certain rites , and also certain duties of our own which call for good men . Are you ready to be tested ? `` `` I am . `` `` Are you of stout heart ? `` `` I am . `` `` Take a stride forward to prove it . `` As the words were said he felt two hard points in front of his eyes , pressing upon them so that it appeared as if he could not move forward without a danger of losing them . None the less , he nerved himself to
