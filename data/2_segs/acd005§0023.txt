de Maintenon 's friends had rallied to her yesterday , her enemies were active to-day . Monsieur had hardly disappeared before there rushed into the room a youth who bore upon his rich attire every sign of having just arrived from a dusty journey . He was pale-faced and auburn-haired , with features which would have been strikingly like the king 's if it were not that his nose had been disfigured in his youth . The king 's face had lighted up at the sight of him , but it darkened again as he hurried forward and threw himself down at his feet . `` Oh , sire , '' he cried , `` spare us this grief -- -spare us this humiliation ! I implore you to pause before you do what will bring dishonour upon yourself and upon us ! `` The king started back from him , and paced angrily up and down the room . `` This is intolerable ! '' he cried . `` It was bad from my brother , but worse from my son . You are in a conspiracy with him , Louis . Monsieur has told you to act this part . `` The dauphin rose to his feet and looked steadfastly at his angry father . `` I have not seen my uncle , '' he said . `` I was at Meudon when I heard this news -- -this dreadful news -- -and I sprang upon my horse , sire , and galloped over to implore you to think again before you drag our royal house so low . `` `` You are insolent , Louis . `` `` I do not mean to be so , sire . But consider , sire , that my mother was a queen , and that it would be strange indeed if for a step-mother I had a -- - '' The king raised his hand with a gesture of authority which checked the word upon his lips. '' Silence ! '' he cried , `` or you may say that which would for ever set a gulf between us . Am I to be treated worse than my humblest subject , who is allowed to follow his own bent in his private affairs ? `` `` This is not your own private affair , sire ; all that you do reflects upon your family . The great deeds of your reign have given a new glory to the name of Bourbon . Oh , do not mar it now , sire ! I implore it of you upon my bended knees ! `` `` You talk like a fool ! '' cried his father roughly . `` I propose to marry a virtuous and charming lady of one of the oldest noble families of France , and you talk as if I were doing something degrading and unheard of . What is your objection to this lady ? `` `` That she is the daughter of a man whose vices were well known , that her brother is of the worst repute , that she has led the life of an adventuress , is the widow of a deformed scribbler , and that she occupies a menial position in the palace . `` The king had stamped with his foot upon the carpet more than once during this frank address , but his anger blazed into a fury at its conclusion . `` Do you dare , '' he cried , with flashing eyes , `` to call the charge of my children a menial position ? I say that there is no higher in the kingdom . Go back to Meudon , sir , this instant , and never dare to open your mouth again on the subject . Away , I say ! When , in God 's good time , you are king of this country , you may claim your own way , but until then do not venture to cross the plans of one who is both your parent and your monarch . `` The young man bowed low , and walked with dignity from the chamber ; but he turned with his hand upon the door . `` The Abbe Fenelon came with me , sire . Is it your pleasure to see him ? '' '' Away ! away ! '' cried the king furiously , still striding up and down the room with angry face and flashing eyes . The dauphin left the cabinet , and was instantly succeeded by a tall thin priest , some forty years of age , strikingly handsome , with a pale refined face , large well-marked features , and the easy deferential bearing of one who has had a long training in courts . The king turned sharply upon him , and looked hard at him with a distrustful eye . `` Good-day , Abbe Fenelon , '' said he . `` May I ask what the object of this interview is ? `` `` You have had the condescension , sire , on more than one occasion , to ask my humble advice , and even to express yourself afterwards as being pleased that you had acted upon it. '' '' Well ? Well ? Well ? '' growled the monarch . `` If rumour says truly , sire , you are now at a crisis when a word of impartial counsel might be of value to you . Need I say that it would -- - '' '' Tut ! tut ! Why all these words ? '' cried the king . `` You have been sent here by others to try and influence me against Madame de Maintenon . `` `` Sire , I have had nothing but kindness from that lady . I esteem and honour her more than any lady in France . `` `` In that case , abbe , you will , I am sure , be glad to hear that I am about to marry her . Good-day , abbe . I regret that I have not longer time to devote to this very interesting conversation . `` `` But , sire -- - '' '' When my mind is in doubt , abbe , I value your advice very highly . On this occasion my mind is happilynotin doubt . I have the honour to wish you a very good-day . `` The king 's first hot anger had died away by now , and had left behind it a cold , bitter spirit which was even more formidable to his antagonists . The abbe , glib of tongue and fertile of resource as he was , felt himself to be silenced and overmatched . He walked backwards , with three long bows , as was the custom of the court , and departed.But the king had little breathing space . His assailants knew that with persistence they had bent his will before , and they trusted that they might do so again . It was Louvois , the minister , now who entered the room , with his majestic port , his lofty bearing , his huge wig , and his aristocratic face , which , however , showed some signs of trepidation as it met the baleful eye of the king . `` Well , Louvois , what now ? '' he asked impatiently . `` Has some new state matter arisen ? `` `` There is but one new state matter which has arisen , sire , but it is of such importance as to banish all others from our mind . `` `` What then ? `` `` Your marriage , sire . `` `` You disapprove of it ? `` `` Oh , sire , can I help it ? `` `` Out of my room , sir ! Am I to be tormented to death by your importunities ? What ! You dare to linger when I order you to go ! '' The king advanced angrily upon the minister , but Louvois suddenly flashed out his rapier . Louis sprang back with alarm and amazement upon his face , but it was the hilt and not the point which was presented to him . `` Pass it through my heart , sire ! '' the minister cried , falling upon his knees , his whole great frame in a quiver with emotion . `` I will not live to see your glory fade ! `` `` Great heaven ! '' shrieked Louis , throwing the sword down upon the ground , and raising his hands to his temples , `` I believe that this is a conspiracy to drive me mad . Was ever a man so tormented in his life ? This will be a private marriage , man , and it will not affect the state in the least degree . Do you hear me ? Have you understood me ? What more do you want ? `` Louvois gathered himself up , and shot his rapier back into its sheath . `` Your Majesty is determined ? '' he asked. '' Absolutely . `` `` Then I say no more . I have done my duty . '' He bowed his head as one in deep dejection when he departed , but in truth his heart was lightened within him , for he had the king 's assurance that the woman whom he hated would , even though his wife , not sit on the throne of the Queens of France.These repeated attacks , if they had not shaken the king 's resolution , had at least irritated and exasperated him to the utmost . Such a blast of opposition was a new thing to a man whose will had been the one law of the land . It left him ruffled and disturbed , and without regretting his resolution , he still , with unreasoning petulance , felt inclined to visit the inconvenience to which he had been put upon those whose advice he had followed . He wore accordingly no very cordial face when the usher in attendance admitted the venerable figure of Father la Chaise , his confessor . `` I wish you all happiness , sire , '' said the Jesuit , `` and I congratulate you from my heart that you have taken the great step which must lead to content both in this world and the next . `` `` I have had neither happiness nor contentment yet , father , '' answered the king peevishly . `` I have never been so pestered in my life . The whole court has been on its knees to me to entreat me to change my intention . `` The Jesuit looked at him anxiously out of his keen gray eyes . `` Fortunately , your Majesty is a man of strong will , '' said he , `` and not to be so easily swayed as they think . `` `` No , no , I did not give an inch . But still , it must be confessed that it is very unpleasant to have so many against one . I think that most men would have been shaken . `` `` Now is the time to stand firm , sire ; Satan rages to see you passing out of his power , and he stirs up all his friends and sends all his emissaries to endeavour to detain you . `` But the king was not in a humour to be easily consoled . `` Upon my word , father , '' said he , `` you do not seem to have much respect for my family . My brother and my son , with the Abbe Fenelon and the Minister of War , are the emissaries to whom you
