even as we have done . And hence will come a nation which will surely take all that is good and leave all that is bad , moulding and fashioning itself into the highest . Do I not see such a mighty people , a people who will care more to raise their lowest than to exalt their richest -- -who will understand that there is more bravery in peace than in war , who will see that all men are brothers , and whose hearts will not narrow themselves down to their own frontiers , but will warm in sympathy with every noble cause the whole world through ? That is what I see , Adele , as I lie here beside a shore upon which I shall never set my feet , and I say to you that if you and Amory go to the building of such a nation then indeed your lives are not misspent . It will come , and when it comes , may God guard it , may God watch over it and direct it ! '' His head had sunk gradually lower upon his breast and his lids had fallen slowly over his eyes which had been looking away out past Point Levi at the rolling woods and the far-off mountains . Adele gave a quick cry of despair and threw her arms round the old man 's neck . `` He is dying , Amory , he is dying ! '' she cried.A stern Franciscan friar , who had been telling his beads within a few paces of them , heard the cry and was beside them in an instant . `` He is indeed dying , '' he said , as he gazed down at the ashen face . `` Has the old man had the sacraments of the Church ? `` `` I do not think that he needs them , '' answered De Catinat evasively . `` Which of us do not need them , young man ! '' said the friar sternly . `` And how can a man hope for salvation without them ? I shall myself administer them without delay . `` But the old Huguenot had opened his eyes , and with a last flicker of strength he pushed away the gray-hooded figure which bent over him . `` I left all that I love rather than yield to you , '' he cried , `` and think you that you can overcome me now ? `` The Franciscan started back at the words , and his hard suspicious eyes shot from De Catinat to the weeping girl. '' So ! '' said he . `` You are Huguenots , then ! '' '' Hush ! Do not wrangle before a man who is dying ! '' cried De Catinat in a voice as fierce as his own . `` Before a man who is dead , '' said Amos Green solemnly.As he spoke the old man 's face had relaxed , his thousand wrinkles had been smoothed suddenly out , as though an invisible hand had passed over them , and his head fell back against the mast . Adele remained motionless with her arms still clasped round his neck and her cheek pressed against his shoulder . She had fainted.De Catinat raised his wife and bore her down to the cabin of one of the ladies who had already shown them some kindness . Deaths were no new thing aboard the ship , for they had lost ten soldiers upon the outward passage , so that amid the joy and bustle of the disembarking there were few who had a thought to spare upon the dead pilgrim , and the less so when it was whispered abroad that he had been a Huguenot . A brief order was given that he should be buried in the river that very night , and then , save for a sailmaker who fastened the canvas round him , mankind had done its last for Theophile Catinat . With the survivors , however , it was different , and when the troops were all disembarked , they were mustered in a little group upon the deck , and an officer of the governor 's suite decided upon what should be done with them . He was a portly , good-humoured , ruddy-cheeked man , but De Catinat saw with apprehension that the friar walked by his side as he advanced along the deck , and exchanged a few whispered remarks with him . There was a bitter smile upon the monk 's dark face which boded little good for the heretics . `` It shall be seen to , good father , it shall be seen to , '' said the officer impatiently , in answer to one of these whispered injunctions . `` I am as zealous a servant of Holy Church as you are . `` `` I trust that you are , Monsieur de Bonneville . With so devout a governor as Monsieur de Denonville , it might be an ill thing even in this world for the officers of his household to be lax . `` The soldier glanced angrily at his companion , for he saw the threat which lurked under the words . `` I would have you remember , father , '' said he , `` that if faith is a virtue , charity is no less so . '' Then , speaking in English : `` Which is Captain Savage ? `` `` Ephraim Savage of Boston . `` `` And Master Amos Green ? `` `` Amos Green of New York . `` `` And Master Tomlinson ? `` `` John Tomlinson of Salem . `` `` And master mariners Hiram Jefferson , Joseph Cooper , Seek-grace Spalding , and Paul Cushing , all of Massachusetts Bay ? `` `` We are all here . `` `` It is the governor 's order that all whom I have named shall be conveyed at once to the trading brigHope , which is yonder ship with the white paint line . She sails within the hour for the English provinces . `` A buzz of joy broke from the castaway mariners at the prospect of being so speedily restored to their homes , and they hurried away to gather together the few possessions which they had saved from the wreck . The officer put his list in his pocket and stepped across to where De Catinat leaned moodily against the bulwarks . `` Surely you remember me , '' he said . `` I could not forget your face , even though you have exchanged a blue coat for a black one . `` De Catinat grasped the hand which was held out to him . `` I remember you well , De Bonneville , and the journey that we made together to Fort Frontenac , but it was not for me to claim your friendship , now that things have gone amiss with me . `` `` Tut , man ; once my friend always my friend . `` `` I feared , too , that my acquaintance would do you little good with yonder dark-cowled friar who is glowering behind you . `` `` Well , well , you know how it is with us here . Frontenac could keep them in their place , but De la Barre was as clay in their hands , and this new one promises to follow in his steps . What with the Sulpitians at Montreal and the Jesuits here , we poor devils are between the upper and the nether stones . But I am grieved from my heart to give such a welcome as this to an old comrade , and still more to his wife . `` `` What is to be done , then ? `` `` You are to be confined to the ship until she sails , which will be in a week at the furthest . `` `` And then ? `` `` You are to be carried home in her and handed over to the Governor of Rochelle to be sent back to Paris . Those are Monsieur de Denonville 's orders , and if they be not carried out to the letter , then we shall have the whole hornet 's nest about our ears . `` De Catinat groaned as he listened . After all their strivings and trials and efforts , to return to Paris , the scorn of his enemies , and an object of pity to his friends , was too deep a humiliation . He flushed with shame at the very thought . To be led back like the home-sick peasant who has deserted from his regiment ! Better one spring into the broad blue river beneath him , were it not for little pale-faced Adele who had none but him to look to . It was so tame ! So ignominious ! And yet in this floating prison , with a woman whose fate was linked with his own , what hope was there of escape ? De Bonneville had left him , with a few blunt words of sympathy , but the friar still paced the deck with a furtive glance at him from time to time , and two soldiers who were stationed upon the poop passed and repassed within a few yards of him . They had orders evidently to mark his movements . Heart-sick he leaned over the side watching the Indians in their paint and feathers shooting backwards and forwards in their canoes , and staring across at the town where the gaunt gable ends of houses and charred walls marked the effect of the terrible fire which a few years before had completely destroyed the lower part.As he stood gazing , his attention was drawn away by the swish of oars , and a large boat full of men passed immediately underneath where he stood.It held the New Englanders , who were being conveyed to the ship which was to take them home . There were the four seamen huddled together , and there in the sheets were Captain Ephraim Savage and Amos Green , conversing together and pointing to the shipping . The grizzled face of the old Puritan and the bold features of the woodsman were turned more than once in his direction , but no word of farewell and no kindly wave of the hand came back to the lonely exile . They were so full of their own future and their own happiness , that they had not a thought to spare upon his misery . He could have borne anything from his enemies , but this sudden neglect from his friends came too heavily after his other troubles . He stooped his face to his arms and burst in an instant into a passion of sobs . Before he raised his eyes again the brig had hoisted her anchor , and was tacking under full canvas out of the Quebec basin.That night old Theophile Catinat was buried from the ship 's side , his sole mourners the two who bore his own blood in their veins . The next day De Catinat spent upon deck , amid the bustle and confusion of the unlading , endeavouring to cheer Adele by light chatter which came from a heavy heart . He pointed out to her the places which he had known so well , the citadel where he had been quartered , the college of the Jesuits , the cathedral of Bishop Laval , the magazine of the old company , dismantled by the great fire , and the house of Aubert de la Chesnaye , the only private one which had remained standing in the lower part . From where they lay they could
