me much , and I might win . I came out here more for the sake of seeing a little of the world than anything else , but now that this has turned up I 'll have a shy at it . `` `` Quite so , '' said Farintosh , rubbing his hands . `` You see , '' Ezra continued , lighting a cheroot , `` I have the name here of having a long purse and of knowing which way the wind blows . If I were to be seen buying others would follow my lead , and prices would soon be as high as ever . Now , what I purpose is to work through you , d 'ye see ? You can take out a licence and buy in stones on the quiet without attracting much attention . Beat them down as low as you can , and give this hotel as your address . When they call here they shall be paid , which is better than having you carrying the money round with you . `` The clergyman scowled as though he thought it was anything but better.He did not make any remark , however . `` You can get one or two fellows to help you , '' said Ezra . `` I 'll pay for their licences . I ca n't expect you to work all the camps yourself . Of course , if you offer more for a stone than I care to give , that 's your look out , but if you do your work well you shall not be the loser . You shall have a percentage on business done and a weekly salary as well . `` `` How much money do you care to invest ? '' asked Farintosh . `` I 'm not particular , '' Ezra answered . `` If I do a thing I like to do it well . I 'll go the length of thirty thousand pounds . `` Farintosh was so astonished at the magnitude of the sum that he sank back in his chair in bewilderment . `` Why , sir , '' he said , `` I think just at present you could buy the country for that . `` Ezra laughed . `` We 'll make it go as far as we can , '' he said . `` Of course you may buy claims as well as stones . `` `` And I have carte blanche to that amount ? '' '' Certainly . `` `` All right , I 'll begin this evening , '' said the ex-parson ; and picking up his slouched hat , which he still wore somewhat broader in the brim than his comrades , in deference to old associations , he departed upon his mission.Farintosh was a clever man and soon chose two active subordinates . These were a navvy , named Burt , and Williams , a young Welshman , who had disappeared from home behind a cloud of forged cheques , and having changed his name had made a fresh start in life to the south of the equator . These three worked day and night buying in stones from the more needy and impecunious miners , to whom ready money was a matter of absolute necessity . Farintosh bought in the stock , too , of several small dealers whose nerves had been shaken by the panic . In this way bag after bag was filled with diamonds by Ezra , while he himself was to all appearances doing nothing but smoking cigars and sipping brandy-and-water in front of theCentral Hotel .He was becoming somewhat uneasy in his mind as to how long the delusion would be kept up , or how soon news might come from the Cape that the Ural find had been examined into and had proved to be a myth . In any case , he thought that he would be free from suspicion . Still , it might be as well for him by that time to be upon his homeward journey , for he knew that if by any chance the true facts leaked out there would be no hope of mercy from the furious diggers . Hence he incited Farintosh to greater speed , and that worthy divine with his two agents worked so energetically that in less than a week there was little left of five and thirty thousand pounds.Ezra Girdlestone had shown his power of reading character when he chose the ex-clergyman as his subordinate . It is possible , however , that the young man 's judgment had been inferior to his powers of observation . A clever man as a trusty ally is a valuable article , but when the said cleverness may be turned against his employer the advantage becomes a questionable one.It was perfectly evident to Farintosh that though a stray capitalist might risk a thousand pounds or so on a speculation of this sort , Rothschild himself would hardly care to invest such a sum as had passed through his hands without having some ground on which to go . Having formed this conclusion , and having also turned over in his mind the remarkable coincidence that the news of this discovery in Russia should follow so very rapidly upon the visit of the junior partner of the House of Girdlestone , the astute clergyman began to have some dim perception of the truth . Hence he brooded a good deal as he went about his work , and cogitated deeply in a manner which was once again distinctly undesirable in so very intelligent a subordinate.These broodings and cogitations culminated in a meeting , which was held by him with his two sub-agents in the private parlour of the Digger 's Retreat . It was a low-roofed , smoke-stained room , with a profusion of spittoons scattered over it , which , to judge by the condition of the floor , the patrons of the establishment had taken some pains to avoid . Round a solid , old-fashioned table in the centre of this apartment sat Ezra 's staff of assistants , the parson thoughtful but self-satisfied , the others sullen and inquisitive . Farintosh had convened the meeting , and his comrades had an idea that there was something in the wind . They applied themselves steadily , therefore , to the bottle of Hollands upon the table , and waited for him to speak . `` Well , '' the ex-clergyman said at last , `` the game is nearly over , and we 'll not be wanted any more . Girdlestone 's off to England in a day or two . `` Burt and Williams groaned sympathetically . Work was scarce in the diggings during the crisis , and their agencies had been paying them well . `` Yes , he 's off , '' Farintosh went on , glancing keenly at his companions , `` and he takes with him five and thirty thousand pounds worth of diamonds that we bought for him . Poor devils like us , Burt , have to do the work , and then are thrown aside as you would throw your pick aside when you are done with it . When he sells out in London and makes his pile , it wo n't much matter to him that the three men who helped him are starving in Griqualand . `` `` Wo n't he give us somethin ' at partin ' ? '' asked Burt , the navvy . He was a savage-looking , hairy man , with a brick-coloured face and over-hanging eyebrows . `` Wo n't he give us nothing to remembrance him by ? `` `` Give you something ! '' Farintosh said with a sneer . `` Why , man , he says you are too well paid already . `` `` Does he , though ? '' cried the navvy , flushing even redder than nature had made him . `` Is that the way he speaks after we makes him ? It ai n't on the square . I likes to see things honest an ' above board betwixt man an ' man , and this pitchin ' of them as has helped ye over ai n't that . `` Farintosh lowered his voice and bent further over the table . His companions involuntarily imitated his movement , until the three cunning , cruel faces were looking closely into one another 's eyes . `` Nobody knows that he holds those stones , '' said Farintosh . `` He 's too smart to let it out to any one but ourselves . `` `` Where does he keep 'em ? '' asked the Welshman . `` In a safe in his room . `` `` Where is the key ? `` `` On his watch-chain . `` `` Could we get an impression ? `` `` I have one . `` `` Then I can make one , '' cried Williams triumphantly . `` It 's done , '' said Farintosh , taking a small key from his pocket . `` This is a duplicate , and will open the safe . I took the moulding from his key while I was speaking to him . `` The navvy laughed hoarsely . `` If that do n't lick creation for smartness ! '' he cried . `` And how are we to get to this safe ? It would serve him right if we collar the lot . It 'll teach him that if he ai n't honest by nature he 's got to be when he deals with the like of us . I like straightness , and by the Lord I 'll have it ! '' He brought his great fist down upon the table to emphasize this commendable sentiment . `` It 's not an easy matter , '' Farintosh said thoughtfully . `` When he goes out he locks his door , and there 's no getting in at the window . There 's only one chance for us that I can see . His room is a bit cut off from the rest of the hotel . There 's a gallery of twenty feet or more that leads to it . Now , I was thinking that if the three of us were to visit him some evening , just to wish him luck on his journey , as it were , and if , while we were in the room something sudden was to happen which would knock him silly for a minute or two , we might walk off with the stones and be clean gone before he could raise an alarm . `` `` And what would knock him silly ? '' asked Williams . He was an unhealthy , scorbutic-looking youth , and his pallid complexion had assumed a greenish tinge of fear as he listened to the clergyman 's words . He had the makings in him of a mean and dangerous criminal , but not of a violent one -- -belonging to the jackal tribe rather than to the tiger . `` What would knock him senseless ? '' Farintosh asked Burt , with a knowing look.Burt laughed again in his bushy , red beard . `` You can leave that to me , mate , '' he said.Williams glanced from one to the other and he became even more cadaverous . `` I 'm not in it , '' he stammered . `` It will be a hanging job . You will kill him as like as not . `` `` Not in it , ai n't ye ? '' growled the navvy . `` Why , you white-livered hound , you 're too deep in it ever to get out again .
