Douglas in London , he being at that time a widower . She was a beautiful woman , tall , dark , and slender , some twenty years younger than her husband ; a disparity which seemed in no wise to mar the contentment of their family life.It was remarked sometimes , however , by those who knew them best , that the confidence between the two did not appear to be complete , since the wife was either very reticent about her husband 's past life , or else , as seemed more likely , was imperfectly informed about it . It had also been noted and commented upon by a few observant people that there were signs sometimes of some nerve-strain upon the part of Mrs. Douglas , and that she would display acute uneasiness if her absent husband should ever be particularly late in his return . On a quiet countryside , where all gossip is welcome , this weakness of the lady of the Manor House did not pass without remark , and it bulked larger upon people 's memory when the events arose which gave it a very special significance.There was yet another individual whose residence under that roof was , it is true , only an intermittent one , but whose presence at the time of the strange happenings which will now be narrated brought his name prominently before the public . This was Cecil James Barker , of Hales Lodge , Hampstead.Cecil Barker 's tall , loose-jointed figure was a familiar one in the main street of Birlstone village ; for he was a frequent and welcome visitor at the Manor House . He was the more noticed as being the only friend of the past unknown life of Mr. Douglas who was ever seen in his new English surroundings . Barker was himself an undoubted Englishman ; but by his remarks it was clear that he had first known Douglas in America and had there lived on intimate terms with him . He appeared to be a man of considerable wealth , and was reputed to be a bachelor.In age he was rather younger than Douglas -- -forty-five at the most -- -a tall , straight , broad-chested fellow with a clean-shaved , prize-fighter face , thick , strong , black eyebrows , and a pair of masterful black eyes which might , even without the aid of his very capable hands , clear a way for him through a hostile crowd . He neither rode nor shot , but spent his days in wandering round the old village with his pipe in his mouth , or in driving with his host , or in his absence with his hostess , over the beautiful countryside . `` An easy-going , free-handed gentleman , '' said Ames , the butler . `` But , my word ! I had rather not be the man that crossed him ! '' He was cordial and intimate with Douglas , and he was no less friendly with his wife -- -a friendship which more than once seemed to cause some irritation to the husband , so that even the servants were able to perceive his annoyance . Such was the third person who was one of the family when the catastrophe occurred.As to the other denizens of the old building , it will suffice out of a large household to mention the prim , respectable , and capable Ames , and Mrs. Allen , a buxom and cheerful person , who relieved the lady of some of her household cares . The other six servants in the house bear no relation to the events of the night of January 6th.It was at eleven forty-five that the first alarm reached the small local police station , in charge of Sergeant Wilson of the Sussex Constabulary . Cecil Barker , much excited , had rushed up to the door and pealed furiously upon the bell . A terrible tragedy had occurred at the Manor House , and John Douglas had been murdered . That was the breathless burden of his message . He had hurried back to the house , followed within a few minutes by the police sergeant , who arrived at the scene of the crime a little after twelve o'clock , after taking prompt steps to warn the county authorities that something serious was afoot.On reaching the Manor House , the sergeant had found the drawbridge down , the windows lighted up , and the whole household in a state of wild confusion and alarm . The white-faced servants were huddling together in the hall , with the frightened butler wringing his hands in the doorway . Only Cecil Barker seemed to be master of himself and his emotions ; he had opened the door which was nearest to the entrance and he had beckoned to the sergeant to follow him . At that moment there arrived Dr. Wood , a brisk and capable general practitioner from the village . The three men entered the fatal room together , while the horror-stricken butler followed at their heels , closing the door behind him to shut out the terrible scene from the maid servants.The dead man lay on his back , sprawling with outstretched limbs in the centre of the room . He was clad only in a pink dressing gown , which covered his night clothes . There were carpet slippers on his bare feet . The doctor knelt beside him and held down the hand lamp which had stood on the table . One glance at the victim was enough to show the healer that his presence could be dispensed with . The man had been horribly injured . Lying across his chest was a curious weapon , a shotgun with the barrel sawed off a foot in front of the triggers . It was clear that this had been fired at close range and that he had received the whole charge in the face , blowing his head almost to pieces . The triggers had been wired together , so as to make the simultaneous discharge more destructive.The country policeman was unnerved and troubled by the tremendous responsibility which had come so suddenly upon him . `` We will touch nothing until my superiors arrive , '' he said in a hushed voice , staring in horror at the dreadful head . `` Nothing has been touched up to now , '' said Cecil Barker . `` I 'll answer for that . You see it all exactly as I found it . `` `` When was that ? '' The sergeant had drawn out his notebook . `` It was just half-past eleven . I had not begun to undress , and I was sitting by the fire in my bedroom when I heard the report . It was not very loud -- -it seemed to be muffled . I rushed down -- -I do n't suppose it was thirty seconds before I was in the room . `` `` Was the door open ? `` `` Yes , it was open . Poor Douglas was lying as you see him . His bedroom candle was burning on the table . It was I who lit the lamp some minutes afterward . `` `` Did you see no one ? '' '' No . I heard Mrs. Douglas coming down the stair behind me , and I rushed out to prevent her from seeing this dreadful sight . Mrs. Allen , the housekeeper , came and took her away . Ames had arrived , and we ran back into the room once more . `` `` But surely I have heard that the drawbridge is kept up all night . `` `` Yes , it was up until I lowered it . `` `` Then how could any murderer have got away ? It is out of the question ! Mr. Douglas must have shot himself . `` `` That was our first idea . But see ! '' Barker drew aside the curtain , and showed that the long , diamond-paned window was open to its full extent . `` And look at this ! '' He held the lamp down and illuminated a smudge of blood like the mark of a boot-sole upon the wooden sill . `` Someone has stood there in getting out . `` `` You mean that someone waded across the moat ? '' '' Exactly ! `` `` Then if you were in the room within half a minute of the crime , he must have been in the water at that very moment . `` `` I have not a doubt of it . I wish to heaven that I had rushed to the window ! But the curtain screened it , as you can see , and so it never occurred to me . Then I heard the step of Mrs. Douglas , and I could not let her enter the room . It would have been too horrible . `` `` Horrible enough ! '' said the doctor , looking at the shattered head and the terrible marks which surrounded it . `` I 've never seen such injuries since the Birlstone railway smash . `` `` But , I say , '' remarked the police sergeant , whose slow , bucolic common sense was still pondering the open window . `` It 's all very well your saying that a man escaped by wading this moat , but what I ask you is , how did he ever get into the house at all if the bridge was up ? `` `` Ah , that 's the question , '' said Barker . `` At what o'clock was it raised ? `` `` It was nearly six o'clock , '' said Ames , the butler . `` I 've heard , '' said the sergeant , `` that it was usually raised at sunset . That would be nearer half-past four than six at this time of year. '' '' Mrs . Douglas had visitors to tea , '' said Ames . `` I could n't raise it until they went . Then I wound it up myself . `` `` Then it comes to this , '' said the sergeant : `` If anyone came from outside -- -IF they did -- -they must have got in across the bridge before six and been in hiding ever since , until Mr. Douglas came into the room after eleven . `` `` That is so ! Mr. Douglas went round the house every night the last thing before he turned in to see that the lights were right . That brought him in here . The man was waiting and shot him . Then he got away through the window and left his gun behind him . That 's how I read it ; for nothing else will fit the facts . `` The sergeant picked up a card which lay beside the dead man on the floor . The initials V.V . and under them the number 341 were rudely scrawled in ink upon it . `` What 's this ? '' he asked , holding it up.Barker looked at it with curiosity . `` I never noticed it before , '' he said . `` The murderer must have left it behind him. '' '' V.V. -- -341 . I can make no sense of that . `` The sergeant kept turning it over in his big fingers . `` What 's V.V. ? Somebody 's initials , maybe . What have you got there , Dr . Wood ? `` It was a good-sized hammer which had been lying on the rug in front of the fireplace -- -a substantial , workmanlike hammer . Cecil Barker pointed to
