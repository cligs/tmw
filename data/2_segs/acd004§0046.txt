you in our trouble as to the natural protector of all who are weak . `` `` Nay , nay , as brothers to a brother , '' cried the prince , with sparkling eyes . `` We doubt not , with the help of God , to see you very soon restored to those thrones from which you have been so traitorously thrust . `` `` When that happy day comes , '' said Pedro , `` then Spain shall be to you as Aquitaine , and , be your project what it may , you may ever count on every troop and every ship over which flies the banner of Castile . `` `` And , '' added the other , `` upon every aid which the wealth and power of Majorca can bestow . `` `` Touching the hundred thousand crowns in which I stand your debtor , '' continued Pedro carelessly , `` it can no doubt -- -- -- '' '' Not a word , sire , not a word ! '' cried the prince . `` It is not now when you are in grief that I would vex your mind with such base and sordid matters . I have said once and forever that I am yours with every bow-string of my army and every florin in my coffers. '' '' Ah ! here is indeed a mirror of chivalry , '' said Don Pedro . `` I think , Sir Fernando , since the prince 's bounty is stretched so far , that we may make further use of his gracious goodness to the extent of fifty thousand crowns . Good Sir William Felton , here , will doubtless settle the matter with you . `` The stout old English counsellor looked somewhat blank at this prompt acceptance of his master 's bounty . `` If it please you , sire , '' he said , `` the public funds are at their lowest , seeing that I have paid twelve thousand men of the companies , and the new taxes -- -the hearth-tax and the wine-tax -- -not yet come in . If you could wait until the promised help from England comes -- -- -- '' '' Nay , nay , my sweet cousin , '' cried Don Pedro . `` Had we known that your own coffers were so low , or that this sorry sum could have weighed one way or the other , we had been loth indeed -- -- -- '' '' Enough , sire , enough ! '' said the prince , flushing with vexation . `` If the public funds be , indeed , so backward , Sir William , there is still , I trust , my own private credit , which hath never been drawn upon for my own uses , but is now ready in the cause of a friend in adversity . Go , raise this money upon our own jewels , if nought else may serve , and see that it be paid over to Don Fernando . `` `` In security I offer -- -- -- '' cried Don Pedro. '' Tush ! tush ! '' said the prince . `` I am not a Lombard , sire . Your kingly pledge is my security , without bond or seal . But I have tidings for you , my lords and lieges , that our brother of Lancaster is on his way for our capital with four hundred lances and as many archers to aid us in our venture . When he hath come , and when our fair consort is recovered in her health , which I trust by the grace of God may be ere many weeks be past , we shall then join the army at Dax , and set our banners to the breeze once more . `` A buzz of joy at the prospect of immediate action rose up from the group of warriors . The prince smiled at the martial ardor which shone upon every face around him . `` It will hearten you to know , '' he continued , `` that I have sure advices that this Henry is a very valiant leader , and that he has it in his power to make such a stand against us as promises to give us much honor and pleasure . Of his own people he hath brought together , as I learn , some fifty thousand , with twelve thousand of the French free companies , who are , as you know very valiant and expert men-at-arms . It is certain also , that the brave and worthy Bertrand de Guesclin hath ridden into France to the Duke of Anjou , and purposes to take back with him great levies from Picardy and Brittany . We hold Bertrand in high esteem , for he has oft before been at great pains to furnish us with an honorable encounter . What think you of it , my worthy Captal ? He took you at Cocherel , and , by my soul ! you will have the chance now to pay that score . `` The Gascon warrior winced a little at the allusion , nor were his countrymen around him better pleased , for on the only occasion when they had encountered the arms of France without English aid they had met with a heavy defeat . `` There are some who say , sire , '' said the burly De Clisson , `` that the score is already overpaid , for that without Gascon help Bertrand had not been taken at Auray , nor had King John been overborne at Poictiers . `` `` By heaven ! but this is too much , '' cried an English nobleman . `` Methinks that Gascony is too small a cock to crow so lustily . `` `` The smaller cock , my Lord Audley , may have the longer spur , '' remarked the Captal de Buch . `` May have its comb clipped if it make over-much noise , '' broke in an Englishman . `` By our Lady of Rocamadour ! '' cried the Lord of Mucident , `` this is more than I can abide . Sir John Charnell , you shall answer to me for those words ! `` `` Freely , my lord , and when you will , '' returned the Englishman carelessly . `` My Lord de Clisson , '' cried Lord Audley , `` you look somewhat fixedly in my direction . By God 's soul ! I should be right glad to go further into the matter with you . `` `` And you , my Lord of Pommers , '' said Sir Nigel , pushing his way to the front , `` it is in my mind that we might break a lance in gentle and honorable debate over the question . `` For a moment a dozen challenges flashed backwards and forwards at this sudden bursting of the cloud which had lowered so long between the knights of the two nations . Furious and gesticulating the Gascons , white and cold and sneering the English , while the prince with a half smile glanced from one party to the other , like a man who loved to dwell upon a fiery scene , and yet dreaded least the mischief go so far that he might find it beyond his control . `` Friends , friends ! '' he cried at last , `` this quarrel must go no further . The man shall answer to me , be he Gascon or English , who carries it beyond this room . I have overmuch need for your swords that you should turn them upon each other . Sir John Charnell , Lord Audley , you do not doubt the courage of our friends of Gascony ? `` `` Not I , sire , '' Lord Audley answered . `` I have seen them fight too often not to know that they are very hardy and valiant gentlemen . `` `` And so say I , '' quoth the other Englishman ; `` but , certes , there is no fear of our forgetting it while they have a tongue in their heads . `` `` Nay , Sir John , '' said the prince reprovingly , `` all peoples have their own use and customs . There are some who might call us cold and dull and silent . But you hear , my lords of Gascony , that these gentlemen had no thought to throw a slur upon your honor or your valor , so let all anger fade from your mind . Clisson , Captal , De Pommers , I have your word ? `` `` We are your subjects , sire , '' said the Gascon barons , though with no very good grace . `` Your words are our law . `` `` Then shall we bury all cause of unkindness in a flagon of Malvoisie , '' said the prince , cheerily . `` Ho , there ! the doors of the banquet-hall ! I have been over long from my sweet spouse but I shall be back with you anon . Let the sewers serve and the minstrels play , while we drain a cup to the brave days that are before us in the south ! '' He turned away , accompanied by the two monarchs , while the rest of the company , with many a compressed lip and menacing eye , filed slowly through the side-door to the great chamber in which the royal tables were set forth.Whilst the prince 's council was sitting , Alleyne and Ford had remained in the outer hall , where they were soon surrounded by a noisy group of young Englishmen of their own rank , all eager to hear the latest news from England . `` How is it with the old man at Windsor ? '' asked one . `` And how with the good Queen Philippa ? `` `` And how with Dame Alice Perrers ? '' cried a third . `` The devil take your tongue , Wat ! '' shouted a tall young man , seizing the last speaker by the collar and giving him an admonitory shake . `` The prince would take your head off for those words . `` `` By God 's coif ! Wat would miss it but little , '' said another . `` It is as empty as a beggar 's wallet . `` `` As empty as an English squire , coz , '' cried the first speaker . `` What a devil has become of the maitre-des-tables and his sewers ? They have not put forth the trestles yet . `` `` Mon Dieu ! if a man could eat himself into knighthood , Humphrey , you had been a banneret at the least , '' observed another , amid a burst of laughter . `` And if you could drink yourself in , old leather-head , you had been first baron of the realm , '' cried the aggrieved Humphrey . `` But how of England , my lads of Loring ? `` `` I take it , '' said Ford , `` that it is much as it was when you were there last , save that perchance there is a little less noise there . `` `` And why less noise , young Solomon ? `` `` Ah , that is for your wit to discover. '' '' Pardieu ! here is a paladin come over , with the Hampshire mud still sticking to his shoes . He means that the noise is less for our being out of the country . `` `` They are very quick in these parts
